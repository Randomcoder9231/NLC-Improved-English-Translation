<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_0"><text>It seems you needed me for something?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_1"><text>Marked One... You are one of those. You are needed by the enlightened. Accept the appointment and fulfill what is prescribed, as we all do!</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_2"><text>Hold on, hold on! What’s going on here? What appointment? What are you talking about? I didn’t ask for any appointment. I just need to find out a couple of things, that’s all.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_3"><text>There is a message. There was. From the One That Is. The one who bears the Mark will come. Will be able to receive what he desires. And will bring understanding. It is necessary to guide... There is no unity at this moment of the flow of time. A transponder is needed. You will be able to make it. Then there will be unity. There will be replenishment. There will be direction... You, Marked One... Take the seed. Carry it to the place. Leave it. It will sprout. Then there will be unity and... A reward.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_4"><text>What “seed”? What “place”? What “reward”? What is all this? Why?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_5"><text>The seed. His. It will give the possibility of uniting minds. If it is sown at the points... The right ones... </text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_6"><text>Then why don’t you “sow” it here yourselves? And in general, you should do it yourselves. Your seeds, you sow them.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_7"><text>Not here. The seed is needed for Him at the points of connection with Him. It awaits you, but there is only one path to Him.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_8"><text>Wait, wait... Brrr! “It” is waiting for me? I actually wanted to find out how I can get past that barrier that won’t let me go any further... There, to the station.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_9"><text>Yes. It has been waiting for a long time. You are on the path of understanding... There was a seed, It sprouted in the Foggy Thicket... It received energy... But one is not enough... It needs more. Now it needs more... Those like you can. You do not need His attention, as we do. But you also bear His seal, It will let you pass. You are Marked One, It will let you pass.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_10"><text>So it is a “seal” after all?.. But I don’t feel any seal. Maybe there is nothing at all, and all of this is just... a coincidence? Absurdity?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_11"><text>You were marked by Him. Now I do not see His sign... But It remembers and will let you pass.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_12"><text>And why would It let me pass? To brand me again?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_13"><text>You want to know yourself. Only It will tell the truth. You will understand everything with Him. Who you truly are. Do not waste time. Strive toward Him.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_14"><text>Alright... Stranger things have happened. If there’s no other way to learn that truth, but there’s a chance to understand something by doing this... What kind of seeds are these and where do I plant them?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_15"><text>Places of energy. Of flows. Exit points... Of His shoots. You call these places “Matrices”.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_16"><text>Those are anomalies, right... And anyway, it still depends where to take them. I haven’t decided yet.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_17"><text>You humans say “Ivankovsky District Center”, there. You will be able to. Leave the seed... And you say “Tesla”. There... And you say “Radar”. Leave it. And plant it... The seed is alive. It will not die. In the right place it will sprout... At the right time. Do not wait. Time itself will come.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_18"><text>Oh, damn... I don’t know... I’ll think about it some more. \nAnd this... if I lose it, or it gets stolen, or I sell it — you never know, things happen — then what? Come back to you again?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_19"><text>It must not be lost... Do what must be done. There will be no others.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_20"><text>Everything’s so complicated with you... Why does “it” give so few seeds? Aren’t you afraid to part with such a rarity?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_21"><text>Not few... But by your temporal measures the process is long. In this span of time — there are none. The seed always exists. It will not be exhausted. But later. Much later.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_22"><text>Yeah, “it” has nowhere to hurry. It has eternity ahead... Alright, but if I do plant your seeds, then what? Look for you here again?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_23"><text>I will summon you when I understand that It has accepted the seed. Return and you will receive what is important. That with which you will be able to reach Him...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_24"><text>You could’ve started with that. Instead it’s him, from him, yours — damn it... My head’s spinning with you.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_25"><text>Take it and go. Do not waste time.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_26"><text>Your seeds sure are heavy...</text></string>

<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_0"><text>So how’s Ivar doing?</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_1"><text>And what about him? Looks like your Ivar is feeling better.</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_2"><text>Why “my” Ivar?</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_3"><text>Well, you’re always fussing over him. The Doctor said he’ll live.</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_4"><text>Yeah... So the Doctor came by?</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_5"><text>Yes. Didn’t stay long at all and left right away. Why he hides from people is unclear... Didn’t you run into him here?</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_6"><text>Not here.</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_7"><text>He came to take a look at Ivar. Injected him with something and left. Said there was nothing more to be done. Said these are consequences of radiation. Some kind of... local cerebral circulation disorder. Like a microstroke, basically. But he should gradually recover on his own, since he wasn’t crippled right away. Just shouldn’t strain himself mentally for now. And what is there for him to strain himself with... He just sits there and sits.</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_8"><text>That’s already good. And where did the Doctor go?</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_9"><text>How should I know? Hiding somewhere as usual. I heard through the grapevine, just between us, that he was hanging around Borov’s lot for a while. Either laying low with them or something else... Looks like he crossed someone or learned something he wasn’t supposed to. So he didn’t stick around here, left in a hurry.</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_10"><text>With Borov’s people? Seriously? Did you make that up yourself?</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_11"><text>Alright, I said it, you forgot it. Rumors, you know, don’t just appear out of nowhere.</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_12"><text>Nonsense... And even if he was with them, so what? A doctor is a doctor — help without borders, so to speak.</text></string>

... \n \n
Well then, as for the so-called “monolith”, or as they have now begun to write in monographs — the Monolith — what would you say about it? What is its role in all of this? \n \n
There are many hypotheses, but given the current circumstances, the most reasonable one to me seems to be the following: \n
The Monolith absorbs hundreds of human psi-images, essentially feeds on them, replenishing its psi-energy. These include everyone who was in that area at the moment of the Monolith’s emergence about a hundred years ago, as well as those who somehow end up within this field even now — even though unprecedented protective measures have since been adopted, there are more and more “holes” leading there... Are you familiar with the theory of teleportation? \n \n
Well... briefly. Let’s not dwell on it. \n \n
So then. Those whom the Monolith has absorbed do not return — they become nobody, they are gone — and this is where the zombified come from. Their psycho-images were absorbed by the Monolith and it emptied their, uh... soul... far too strongly. \n \n
“Absorbed”? “Emptied the soul”. Isn’t that a bit... unscientific for a hypothesis of this level? \n \n
But somehow one has to explain to the layman, in imagery familiar to him, what “the superposition of a consciousness matrix” actually is. \n \n
Alright. Let’s go with that. But then what exactly is the Monolith itself? Some specific object? \n \n
It can hardly be classified as a material object. The Monolith does not need our physical universe, any material things, bodies, or space. Whatever it may be there, it requires a psychic universe — or, to put it more simply — mental images, everything on that kind of subtle level. Whether it feeds on this or exists within this “field” is still unclear; it remains a mystery even after so many years of study. \n
And since the Monolith itself is considered a non-material object — with only a certain visible projection of it being material, located in some kind of sarcophagus, not the Monolith itself as such — it essentially acts like an informational virus. \n \n
Wait, wait... Why did you decide that it is non-material? Why not simply assume that it is some kind of meteorite? There were such hypotheses as well. \n \n
This is one of the core postulates based on Professor Sokov’s “theory of the collision of worlds”. And at present, this is the most reasonable theory. The meteorite hypothesis collapsed a very long time ago. It is now generally accepted that the Monolith is the result of a “collision”, a “contact” of worlds, and similar terms. But nothing from “that world” — what we would call the antimatter world — can appear materially in this one. Otherwise, annihilation would be inevitable. But since it did not occur and we still exist, we cannot speak of materiality, though we can explain the collision in terms of information, the noosphere, if you will... Do you understand me? \n \n
With difficulty. But I’m trying. Let’s go back one step. \n \n
Yes. Alright. So, the Monolith, as a kind of informational virus, infects at the level of the mind. It changes not the structure of the brain as a physical object, but the minds of people. Roughly speaking, it replaces part of consciousness. It absorbs what exists, and inserts its own in the vacated space. A simple, clear analogy would be a computer virus. \n \n
We’ll take a short break... We’ve received several calls. \n \n
... 
</text></string>
<string id="strelok_sheets_news_1"><text>
... \n \n
How is this “expansion” even possible? After all, you yourself spoke of the object’s non-material nature. \n \n
Quite right. But how are we to explain its behavior in terms of our laws of physics? It is unknown what exists there, in the other universe of the Monolith, but in ours — the one it entered — the law of conservation of energy and the laws of thermodynamics apply. Therefore, it simply has to survive in our world somehow, as if it were a living object — to “grow”, to expand, to seize new territories, new sources of nourishment. Otherwise, inevitable entropy and death. In this world, at least. \n \n
Alright. Let us assume that, but earlier we spoke about a certain field of “powerlessness”. \n \n
Yes, yes. A little more on that. Then it turns out that this field of “apathy”, or rather “powerlessness”, as you put it, is precisely the result of the Monolith’s influence. The result of its “vital activity” in this world. It draws masses of people toward itself, infects them — that is, introduces a part of itself into their consciousness, replaces it with a virus, and so on — and then releases them. That is, it ceases that very “call” we spoke of. This is how the Monolith expands its sphere of influence, grows — for it has neither hands, nor legs, nor a body, yet it must somehow survive, having entered this world... You do understand that this is merely an abstract model? \n \n
Yes. I understand. \n \n
By the force of its influence, it encourages more and more people to strive toward its sphere of influence. This is its “food source”. That is why it induces illusions. And for some reason everyone “wants” to come closer to it, despite having no idea what is there — yet everyone shares the same thought: that it is good there, whatever it may be. \n
But this is not enough for it. The Monolith “throws out” traps, lures — the so-called artifacts — for the sake of which people not yet subject to the influence of the “call” may strive toward it. And the number of these “toys”, by which I mean the variety of types, already defies analysis. \n
It projects the illusion of some endless, free happiness somewhere nearby, close to it. And then it plunges people into apathy and, having “fed”, releases them beyond the perimeter with an already replaced consciousness. That is, it changes the polarity of the field from “come to me, here happiness is free” to “leave this place, there is only disappointment here”. \n \n
I’m afraid not everyone will be able to digest this. It’s like with the theory of relativity. It seems clear when explained on one’s fingers, but once you go into the details... \n \n
Naturally. The complete theory is far more complex, but I am explaining it to you precisely “on one’s fingers”. Otherwise we would stray into such depths that we would not have enough time for any conversation at all. Its format is limited as it is... \n \n
... 
</text></string>
<string id="strelok_sheets_news_2"><text>
...  \n \n
Let’s talk a bit more about the “fragment”, and then it will be time for us to wrap up... \n \n
As I already said, the “fragment” is not a material stone, not a special artifact — it is something mental. It is that very virus which the carriers are meant to carry beyond the limits of the restricted territory and allow the Monolith to “grow”. \n \n
But how do they understand that they have a “fragment”? After all, everyone who had it speaks specifically of a material object. \n \n
No. All those who “had” it, had it as an illusion. They, roughly speaking, lost their minds, possessing such a mental image — a replica of the little Monolith. \n
And further, when they leave the sphere of its influence, all this madness does not go anywhere in any degree — it is inherited and grows progressively. Which is exactly what we are now observing everywhere. People are “growing stupider” right before our eyes. Universally. \n
And there you have the answer to how the Monolith, not being a living or material object of our world, nevertheless captures this world. This is the true “expansion of the Zone” with which we began our conversation. It is not territorial expansion at all. \n \n
Do you believe we can no longer stop this? This, how should I put it, “seizure of minds”. \n \n
It is hard to say. The rate of progression of mental disorders that we are observing inspires no optimism whatsoever. In essence, humanity as a species is degenerating. And the cause of it all, as the majority of scientists now believe, is that very initial virus introduced about a hundred years ago. This is a turning point in the history of mankind... \n \n
...
</text></string>
<string id="strelok_sheets_news_3"><text>
...  \n \n
Right, that’s exactly what I wanted to ask about — the so-called guardians of the Monolith. What kind of people are they? \n \n
That’s precisely what I’m telling you: the Monolithians are not quite human. Their consciousness has been restructured by the Monolith according to a special “program”, meaning they perform a certain controlling function and act as living receptors of the Monolith — through which it “sees”, “hears”, and “perceives” this world that is alien to it. They have a kind of mental connection with the Monolith. And some of them no longer even need to speak. \n \n
So these are the very same “zombies”? \n \n
No, not at all. They are not mindless zombies — “drained souls” — but they are not people in the usual sense either. Rather, they are bodies with replaced consciousness, levers, a working mechanism. They lose the ability to think rationally and become something like “worker bees” — an organism with a single function. This is, of course, very conditional. But they are precisely the ones who do not go insane like those who receive a “fragment”. \n \n
But you yourself say that they have a replaced consciousness... \n \n
Well, yes. Monolithians can carry their own special “pieces of the Monolith”, that is, their own special code that governs their behavior. But at the same time they must remain sane — on their own level, of course. Their role is to somehow lure new potential carriers of the “fragment”, and then to filter out those who are ready to leave, who have “ripened”, so to speak. And also to guard the approaches against those who are mentally opposed to the Monolith. \n \n
But surely something human remains in them? \n \n
Naturally. Not everyone becomes a Monolithian at once. In our universe nothing happens instantaneously, since the factor of time exists. Perhaps in the universe of the Monolith there is no time, but we are not meant to understand that. Therefore, a transitional process is assumed, when a person is not yet a Monolithian, but is no longer quite human either. Probably, in order to achieve some understanding of themselves on a human level, they need to explain these phenomena and this essence in some way. For example, through the creation of a cult, a religion — that is the easiest way for a human being to “understand” the incomprehensible. \n \n
By what criteria, then, does the Monolith choose those who will serve it, and those who will carry its “fragment”? \n \n
Here I can say nothing. If such criteria exist, they are unknown to us. It is impossible either to understand or to predict what something entirely from another world “thinks”. In that world, in theory, logic itself must be completely different — if it exists at all. \n \n
Alright, but if at the initial stage of “monolithization”, so to speak, one were somehow to erase the record or, as you put it, the Monolith’s “psychomatrix”, what would happen to the person? Would they become normal again and behave precisely like a human being? \n \n
Hard to say. It probably all depends on the depth of the influence. If the implanted “code” is insignificant, then most likely the human aspect of such an individual would prevail. But they would not remember certain things, because in place of the erased, conditionally speaking, “code”, the person would not regain the previous data that had been overwritten by that “code”... \n \n

<string id="docent_x10_start_dlg_0"><text>I’ve come across some papers, could you make sense of them?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_start_dlg_1"><text>What kind of papers? Where from?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_start_dlg_2"><text>Look, these documents are from one underground laboratory. I don’t know their contents, but there definitely must be something in them about the operation of the "Brain Scorcher". Right now it’s shut down and without power, and that’s a big mistake. It needs to be turned on, otherwise everyone will die. That’s the short version...</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_start_dlg_3"><text>I’m not sure I want to get into the long version. Alright, I don’t really care either way.\nLet’s see what we’ve got here. Hm... There’s a ton of stuff here... This will take time. Judging by your flustered look, you want an answer as soon as possible, right? Let’s do it this way: I’ll put all my other work aside and deal with yours, and you’ll go for a walk for an hour or so... let’s say, three. Meanwhile, you’ll prepare the payment for my services — a third-level artifact. And make sure not a fly has sat on it, because I know you stalkers, you’ll bring something that’s been used to death, worn to the bone, on its last legs...</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_start_dlg_4"><text>No problem, you’ll get a zero-mileage artifact.</text></string>

<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_0"><text>So, any progress on my question about turning on the "Brain Scorcher"?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_1"><text>It was rather tricky, to be honest, but now I can generally satisfy your curiosity. Did you bring the payment?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_21"><text>A third-level artifact, fresh off the press. Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_22"><text>Hold on a bit, I’ll go fetch a suitable artifact.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_3"><text>Alright then. The bad news: starting the main power supply circuit is a lost cause. Only a team of specialists could handle that. The good news: somewhere beneath the Dark Valley, if I’ve matched the landmarks correctly, there is a backup geothermal generator. Logically, it should be in a standby state right now, but switching it to operational mode is many times easier than the main one. All that’s required is to open the circulation of the heat-transfer fluid, after which it will be possible to switch the facility’s power supply to the backup line.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_4"><text>Open the circulation of the heat-transfer fluid... So I just need to turn some main valve, right? And what about the power? How do I switch it?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_5"><text>Regarding the heat-transfer fluid, I think you’ve got it right. You literally need to look for the “main valve” and turn it. The automation doesn’t work if everything’s without power. As for the power supply, from the service correspondence of some engineer who was listed in the maintenance team assigned to the "Rainbow" complex, I managed to find out that in the same place where the backup generator is located, there is also a control post for it. What it looks like — I have no idea, but you can get inside if you have the access code:</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_6"><text>That’s more or less clear. And then what? How do I fire the "Brain Scorcher" back up?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_7"><text>What I don’t know, I don’t know. There’s nothing about that in the documents. By analogy with the “main valve”, you probably need to look for the main switch. In theory, Ivar should know. After all, it was his guys who shut the installation down.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_8"><text>As for where the switch itself is located, I do have an idea — I’ve already been tipped off. The installation’s operation was controlled from yet another underground facility, the entrance to which is on Radar.\nListen, Docent, there’s one thought that won’t leave me alone. I consulted with one knowledgeable guy, and he dropped a phrase saying that the effect of the "Brain Scorcher" on people might just be a malfunction, an error. As if something is configured incorrectly. Working in the wrong phase or modulation. Something like that. What do you think, is that realistic?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_9"><text>Absolutely! I mean, if someone had deliberately planned to cover a specific area of the Zone with an impassable field for humans, who would need that and why? And to use such... to put it mildly, inhumane methods. To scare off outsiders, the good old ultrasound at a certain frequency would’ve been more than enough. But instead they’re breeding zombified... Using this kind of radiation as a pinpoint weapon — that’s one thing, but to “carpet-bomb” like this... No, something doesn’t add up here. I’m much more inclined to believe in an unintentional error, a malfunction, or even a side effect.\nHm... What if... It just might work...</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_10"><text>What is it? What idea did you have?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_11"><text>Yeah. You know how it is when the right words reach a “critical mass”? Modulation, phase, frequency. And then — bam! An epiphany.\nAnyway, I remembered that your documents contained instructions for switching the installation’s operating modes. This is done using special blocks with programs recorded on them. They are installed into harmonizer-setters, which are actually responsible for tuning the radiation parameters. If you can get the right blocks, you can reset these parameters to “factory” or test settings, if you like. I’m almost certain that with such settings the radiation should become as safe as possible for organic life forms.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_12"><text>And where am I supposed to get these “right blocks” for you? Go look for some warehouse under Radar and shake down the local storekeeper? And he’ll rush at me with outstretched claws, chanting: soldier... sol-dier! Uh... sorry, my jokes are stupid.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_13"><text>Jokes aside, you guessed right about the warehouse. Only it’s not under Radar, but — you won’t believe it — once again under the Dark Valley. Hold on, I saw a waybill somewhere... Aha, here it is. The suitable blocks are marked 12-X-14TO. You’ll need to insert a couple of those into the third and fourth harmonizer, replacing the installed ones. The harmonizer-setters themselves, according to the records, are located at the facility indexed X-8. There’s even a photo of them here, you can keep it.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_14"><text>Ugh... Why is everything always so complicated?! Go there, then here, take this, go back... Alright, I got you. I’d better write the plan of action down in my PDA so I don’t get confused. And try to stick to it.</text></string>
<string id="tex_radar_on_plan_article"><text>Docent helped make sense of Strelok’s papers. And even came up with a way to theoretically save the people who rushed beyond Radar, and who will inevitably die or turn into mindless zombies after the "Rainbow" is restarted. The plan is as follows:\n1. Open the circulation of the heat-transfer fluid in the underground complex beneath the Dark Valley (look for the “main valve” and turn it).\n2. The control post of the backup generator is located there as well. I copied down the code for the entrance door. You need to get inside and start that very generator.\n3. Make your way to the warehouse and find two blocks for the harmonizer-setters marked 12-X-14TO.\n4. Insert the found blocks into harmonizers number three and four, located at the facility indexed X-8.\n5. By analogy with the “main valve”, look for the “main switch” to start the "Rainbow" installation. Its operation was controlled from a laboratory on Radar, the entrance to which is cut straight into the slope of a hill, which can be reached from the fork by moving along the road to the north.</text></string>

<string id="ivar_gen_iskatel_help_64"><text>I just wanted to let you know. So you’d be aware.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_gen_iskatel_help_7"><text>Yeah... Listen, Marked One. Not as a duty, but as a favor... could you bring me a suit? I need it... badly.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_gen_iskatel_help_8"><text>Are you serious, planning to go somewhere?! You still need to sit here and sit until you come to your senses.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_gen_iskatel_help_9"><text>I’m already... better. And you can’t just sit forever. There’s work to be done... My comrade... from our group... died when we were breaking through to the "Brain Scorcher", in the northern part of the forest... find him, if it’s not too much trouble... He had a suit... we got it from Sakharov... new... experimental... I need one like that, for the job.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_gen_iskatel_help_10"><text>Radar?! That’s quite a request you’ve got... Maybe I’ll bring it. I can see you can’t be held back here anyway...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_gen_iskatel_help_11"><text>You... do try. I’ll repay you... I left something here... with the Docent... some time ago...</text></string>

<string id="ivar_outfit_done_dialog_0"><text>Hi, Ivar. I found the armor and... the body, of your friend.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_outfit_done_dialog_1"><text>Yeah... that’s a shame. Well then, now I can start getting ready... </text></string>
<string id="ivar_outfit_done_dialog_2"><text>Take the armor, but if I were you, I wouldn’t rush to leave the Bar. You’re still weak.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_outfit_done_dialog_3"><text>I can’t... sit around without work. Thanks... you helped me out. Take this... artifact.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_outfit_done_dialog_4"><text>I’ll be going, and you get some rest.</text></string>

<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_0"><text>Ivar, I have a question for you. Did you know Strelok well?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_1"><text>No, not at all. Just a passing acquaintance.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_2"><text>Then why did he give you those papers?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_3"><text>I told you why I came here. It all started with former stalkers who returned from the Zone, where they had developed severe mental disorders of a schizo... phrenic nature. That’s how they came to the attention of my colleagues. Every single one of them spoke of some incomprehensible fragment that they had supposedly lost. At first I thought it was some special artifact. Then I learned about the “Black Mark”. I thought it was what was driving people insane. In the end I came to the conclusion that the only way to understand what was going on was to personally visit the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_4"><text>That’s all clear. You said that eventually you decided the “Brain Scorcher” was to blame. But where does Strelok fit into this story? How did he find you?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_5"><text>How — that I don’t know. In principle, many people had heard about our group back then, so finding us if one wanted to wasn’t difficult at all.\nAt that time I still knew almost nothing about the “Brain Scorcher”, but I was looking for any information about radiation whose source was somewhere on Radar. How did I first meet Strelok? One night he simply showed up at our temporary camp at the Army Warehouses in the middle of the night. The sentries missed him — he seemed to appear out of nowhere. He went straight to the point, saying that he knew about our research and was ready to help. In exchange for the materials of my re... search on the connection between the “Black Mark” and the obsessive states of its bearer.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_6"><text>As far as I know, that artifact is a nightmare for any stalker. Only a few survive who manage to “earn” it. Why was Strelok interested in it?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_7"><text>It’s not that simple. Yes, on the one hand, the “Mark” has an extremely negative ef... fect on the body and in some cases even leads to death, but those who were lucky enough to survive it acquire... how should I put it... a kind of immunity, perhaps, to certain types of psi-activity. Note — precisely those who survived the “Mark”, not those who found a way to get rid of it. Obviously, this trait manifests itself at the moment the degenerated artifact breaks down.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_8"><text>I see. You mean that if you’ve “been through” the “Black Mark”, you can safely go for a stroll even under the “Brain Scorcher”?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_9"><text>No. The radiation of the “Brain Scorcher” has a different nature. It’s a man-made object and, as we now know, it was configured to block the spread of the field of apathy. Immunity protects against certain types of, if I may say so, natural psi-activity. That is, things directly connected with the Zone. With the Monolith, if you like. As you probably understand, this topic is not the easiest to study. There is extremely little statistical and, more importantly, objective data, but I still managed to draw some conclusions.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_10"><text>So those with immunity aren’t afraid of controllers? Dogs don’t fry their brains? No double vision after teleportations? Something like that?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_11"><text>Well... I’d say that the nega... tive effects of the phenomena you listed would be reduced to some extent, but that’s not the main point. The “Black Mark” is something like a friend-or-foe test for the Monolith. By what principle those tested are selected, I don’t know, but the fact remains — the immune are not susceptible to the Monolith’s “virus” and cannot be its carriers. Those very “lost fragment” types. If you’ve forgotten what that’s about, reread Strelok’s notes.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_12"><text>No, I remember. So was Strelok really that afraid of getting infected with this “virus”?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_13"><text>I think he simply wanted to obtain the “friend” marker for the Monolith. Who knows how recognition mechanisms work in alien organisms, but I suppose it must be similar to how the human immune system functions. It can always distinguish its own cells from harmful pathogens. Though, of course, under certain conditions there can be failures. Take cancer, for example...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_14"><text>So that means... That means Strelok wanted, roughly speaking, to disguise himself as one of its own in order to get close to the Monolith and... What then? Destroy it? Neutralize it? But how?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_15"><text>I’d like to know the answer to that myself. In any case, he had a problem with the “Black Mark”. As I understood it, for some reason he himself could not obtain it in a nat... ural way, if one can put it that way. After some time, having familiarized himself with my research, he began searching for carriers of the “Mark”. Well, you won’t meet many of those in the nearest stalker camp, obviously. Later I heard rumors that he and some scientist were working on creating a device capable of protecting artifacts from rapid degeneration. I can assume that his main motive once again was to find a way to con... serve the “Mark”, to preserve it in our world for as long as possible.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_16"><text>What an intriguer... So where did he eventually disappear to, any ideas? I can’t believe he could just perish in some dark basement, running into a bloodsucker.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_17"><text>It seems to me that Strelok tried to get to the Monolith to the very end. And it ended badly for him. According to him, he was making his way beyond the “Rainbow” through old underground communications. And supposedly there is even a path underground all the way to the Sarcophagus through some tunnels, but I remember Strelok saying they were flooded and therefore useless. Don’t ask for details, I don’t know them. First, this information didn’t seem wor... thy of attention to me at the time, and second, he wasn’t particularly fond of being frank about side topics not directly related to our agreement.\nIn short, if you want my opinion, Strelok died somewhere on the approaches to the CNPP or right there. Alternatively, he fell under the control of the Monolith.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_18"><text>Yeah... The mysteries only keep multiplying. I need to think all this over. You get some rest for now.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_0"><text>I wanted to ask you something about temporal teleporters.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_1"><text>What exactly interests you? It’s a rather slippery topic and it’s easy to drift from scientific assumptions into fantasy.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_2"><text>You do know something about them.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_3"><text>Know? Hardly. More like hypothesize. So what interests you?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_4"><text>Well, how to explain it... The Zone, it sort of grows. That’s what I’ve heard. And that means the number of all kinds of bubbles, passages, holes in space grows too.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_5"><text>I can’t fault your logic. And?..</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_6"><text>Well, that means there could be more time teleporters as well. Or maybe it’s already easier to get into them, not accidentally, but deliberately...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_7"><text>I see...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_8"><text>Do you think someone could deliberately come to us from the future?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_9"><text>For what purpose?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_10"><text>Well... For example, to put an end to all this. Stop it. Destroy the Monolith... For instance.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_11"><text>I find it interesting to follow the course of your reasoning, but I must disappoint you. Even if we assume something like that, he still wouldn’t be able to change anything.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_12"><text>Why?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_13"><text>Because you can’t change cause and effect! It’s impossible to break the sequence of events. At least if we’re talking about the world around us, and not speculating about black holes... Do you understand?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_14"><text>Not really... After all, if there is some teleporter that can take you into the past, why couldn’t someone use it? And destroy, for example, that same Monolith?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_15"><text>Oh, these stalker myths about the Monolith... You’re so fixated on it. Stalkers invented a fairy tale and tell it to each other. Why would you want to destroy it then? If according to your stalker beliefs it “grants wishes”? Or what does it do there? Hands out happiness to everyone...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_16"><text>Me personally, I don’t really need to. I’m just... For example, if someone decided that the Monolith was the cause of all troubles, or something like that... I’ve read some things about it.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_17"><text>Get that nonsense out of your head... \nAlthough, let’s speculate for amusement. Suppose that in the future someone decided that a certain Monolith had become... uh, bad, dangerous. And decided to travel into the past to change the situation. So then, proceeding from the fact that you can’t change cause and effect, it turns out that it became dangerous there in the future precisely because here, “in the past”, someone attempted to destroy it... Follow my thought?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_18"><text>I’m trying.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_19"><text>This is a reaction to what was done. A response of that Monolith, or whoever else — that’s not the point... That is, the visitor from the future theoretically becomes the very cause of what happened there in his time, but in the future he doesn’t realize this and thinks that he is fixing the situation now, whereas in reality he himself is creating it. In short — a time loop... You look discouraged. </text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_20"><text>Yeah, it’s all kind of complicated...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_21"><text>I’m only trying to prove to you the impossibility of your assumptions. And speaking more simply, in everyday terms, nothing that has already happened can be changed. No matter how hard you try. No-thing!</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_22"><text>That’s exactly what upsets me...</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_101"><text>Well then, my friend, so we’ve finally met.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_102"><text>Ghost, as I understand?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_103"><text>You recognized me? Strange, you shouldn’t have. Or do you remember me after all?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_104"><text>You called me here to talk about my memories?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_105"><text>Not without that. I’m very curious about what’s there — in your memories. And whether they’re even yours.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_106"><text>Listen! If we know each other, speak plainly! Why are you dodging? And besides, if you’re really who you claim to be, then you must know Strelok. Where is he, and how am I connected to him and your group?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_107"><text>Just like that, straight into it? First I’d like to hear what you actually remember. Then I’ll answer some of your questions.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_108"><text>What business is it of yours what I remember? Yes, I lost my memory, woke up in a little village on the Cordon. Thanks to Sidorovich and the Doctor for not letting me die. Little by little, some things are starting to surface in my head. Doc thinks that the more I roam the Zone, the more I talk to people, the higher the chance I’ll run into acquaintances from my “past life”. Talking to them could spur my consciousness and another piece of the puzzle will fall into place. There’s one more lead to my past — Strelok. That’s all you need to know.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_109"><text>Ah! So the Doctor didn’t tell you everything? Wants to keep his hands clean. Like he had nothing to do with it at all. Crafty old man...\nAnswer for answer. We really do know each other, if you can put it that way. But I know almost nothing about you. You’ve met Ivar, right? He, on the other hand, knows perfectly well who you are.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_110"><text>Ivar?! He really did drop something during our conversation like “you remind me of someone, but no, you can’t be him”. I didn’t attach much importance to it, since he himself was... not quite himself.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_111"><text>Yeah. What irony. Tried to cure poor zombies and nearly joined their ranks himself. And it was he who brought you to Strelok in the first place. Didn’t confess, did he? Tsk-tsk!</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_112"><text>WHAT?! What is that supposed to mean? Explain yourself!</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_113"><text>Instead of listening to my explanations, you’d better pin Ivar to the wall properly and ask him straight out yourself. Though... you might later regret choosing knowledge over soothing ignorance. Here and now you are a brave and lucky stalker, Marked One. But what if there, beyond the perimeter, you’re, say, a simple plumber? Living in a one-room Khrushchevka somewhere near Chernihiv with a dim-witted wife and a son who’s a juvenile delinquent. You don’t have a penny to your name, just debts. Every evening you booze it up at a local dive with a bunch of the same losers, out of hopelessness and the realization that nothing good awaits you in life anymore.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_114"><text>Did you spend long inventing my biography? And even if all of that turned out to be true, I still have to know who I am, who I was.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_115"><text>Are you sure? Then allow me to add a couple of details to my “fiction”. One day you drink yourself into delirium tremens and end up in a madhouse, and in your apartment they find the bodies of your family. After coming to your senses a bit and realizing what you’ve done, you escape from the hospital and hide in the Zone. What do you say?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_116"><text>You’re lying about everything! I know you’re a vile and slippery type who wouldn’t hesitate to commit any filth to achieve your goals. I just can’t yet figure out what you’re plotting with regard to me.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_117"><text>To begin with, I’m interested in what drives you. I’ve been watching you for a long time. You climb into the very hell no one else would dare enter. For what? Really, it’s not just the desire to regain your memory and understand yourself that makes you go time and again where even I wouldn’t risk setting foot. You invented that excuse just so you wouldn’t seem like a lunatic to yourself. In reality, you’re quite comfortable even without your lost memories. And don’t say you’ve never thought about it.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_118"><text>Maybe you’re right. Sometimes I myself don’t understand what pushes me so stubbornly to continue the search. The secrets of the Zone? The mythical call of the Monolith? The hope of finally understanding myself? Possibly all of it together.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_119"><text>I’ll throw in another possible reason. You’re being led by a part of Strelok’s consciousness that was merged with your personality as a result of an extremely unusual experiment. Strelok himself considered it a failure, but between us, he was a master of obfuscation and left many things unsaid. I’d really like to know what he was trying to achieve and how he intended to use you.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_120"><text>You know, that’s already too much! I...</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_121"><text>Ivar didn’t happen to let you read Strelok’s notes, did he?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_122"><text>What? Uh... Notes? The ones about the Monolith and our possible future?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_123"><text>Ours or not ours, but yours — definitely. And quite possibly the very near one.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_124"><text>My future? I don’t understand...</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_125"><text>I’m talking about that passage where the guardians of the Monolith are mentioned. As I understand it, that’s exactly what awaits you in the near future.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_126"><text>There was nothing there about any guardians. Are you trying to mess with my head again?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_127"><text>So Strelok didn’t give Ivar everything. Then read what I’m uploading to your PDA now. For the sake of completeness, so to speak. Back in the day I allowed myself to make copies of the files from Strelok’s flash drive, which he carelessly left in... one of our group’s secret hideouts while hastily preparing for a raid.\nOnce you’ve read it, go see Ivar and ask him why he brought you to Strelok. While you’re at it, drop by the Doctor as well. Tell them you met me and that I laid my cards on the table. Otherwise they’ll start wriggling again. I guarantee you’ll learn a lot of interesting things about yourself. Then think it all over properly and come back. We’ll talk in more concrete terms.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_128"><text>Alright, I’ll do as you say. But keep in mind, if anything happens... In short, I’ll find you. And then our conversation will take on a very different tone.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_129"><text>You will, you will. I’m not going anywhere. I’ll be here. After all, you guessed the main thing — I do have certain plans for you.</text></string>

<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, back again? Find anything out?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_202"><text>I will. I definitely will.</text></string>

<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_301"><text>Back already? Talk to Ivar and the Doctor?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_302"><text>I did, I definitely did. Now it’s time to have a word with you, to dot all the i’s, so to speak. Brief and to the point, without lyrical digressions.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_303"><text>Ooh, how businesslike we are. Well then, ask your questions.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_304"><text>Do you know who I am?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_305"><text>No.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_306"><text>Do you know where Strelok is?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_307"><text>No.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_308"><text>Tell me about Strelok’s experiments in the Foggy Thicket.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_309"><text>I can only speak about that in the most general terms. Only Strelok himself knew exactly what was being done there and why. He had a fixation — to reach the Monolith and destroy it. And on that “dead Monolith” in the Foggy Thicket, he was planning to test a device to see how the “real” Monolith might react. There were other experiments as well, but all of them, as I understand it, revolved around this same main goal.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_310"><text>How am I connected to these experiments?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_311"><text>You were found in the Foggy Thicket, near the site of one of them. Strelok said it was as if you fell out of nowhere. Stranger things than that happen in the Thicket — you’ve probably noticed by now. Knowing Strelok, I assumed it was hardly a simple coincidence. He probably didn’t even go to the toilet without a reason. For every “sneeze” he always had an explanation, and for every event — his own thoughts. I asked him point-blank: why did you need this stalker? Strelok just shrugged and repeated that everything that had happened was a misunderstanding, a tragic accident. Asked me to take care of that guy — well, that is, of you.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_312"><text>I see... so, in your opinion, why might I have been useful to him?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_313"><text>At first I decided you were meant to play the role of a “key”. You’ve heard the stories, I assume, that the Zone can let you into certain places only through a sacrifice? Think it’s all fairy tales? I’ve actually encountered that.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_314"><text>Nonsense! Then he wouldn’t have cared about my health. What kind of sacrifice is it that they then treat and nurse back to health?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_315"><text>I thought the same, so I soon discarded this version. Then I started looking for another reason and remembered our argument about transferring consciousness. Not that I seriously believed such a thing was possible, but... Those strange devices and installations he either got hold of somewhere or assembled with Fang’s hands... I’m not very strong technically, but here’s what occurred to me: could Strelok, under the guise of one experiment, have carried out a completely different one?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_316"><text>Are you hinting that he transferred or swapped consciousnesses — even if only partially — with me? But why?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_317"><text>Who knows. Strelok, as I’ve already said, was striving with all his might to reach the Monolith. And he almost succeeded — but only almost. Something was in his way. He lacked some final piece of the mosaic. And I don’t rule out that he tried to obtain that missing element from you.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_318"><text>What element? I don’t... Hm. But the Monolithians almost took me for one of their own. As if I have some kind of sign or mark...</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_319"><text>There you go. You’re thinking. It seems to me that this peculiarity of yours will allow you to reach the Monolith itself. Worth trying, don’t you think? Maybe you’ll find Strelok there too, and in general...</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_320"><text>And yet the Doctor warned me that you would try to persuade me to go to the Monolith. You’d sing like a nightingale, just to find out how to get there yourself. I know that you didn’t share Strelok’s views regarding the Monolith, and as for its destruction — that was the last thing you wanted.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_321"><text>I wasn’t going to hide from you that I have a different opinion on this matter. If the Monolith is truly capable of granting wishes, just imagine how much good that could...</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_322"><text>Drop these attempts, Ghost. I don’t believe in your pious intentions and altruism. Be that as it may, I see no other way for myself than to try to repeat Strelok’s path. And that means I have only one road — to the CNPP. And what I’ll do if I reach the Monolith... we’ll see then.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_323"><text>Believe it or not, that suits me just fine. By the way, since you speak so confidently, maybe you already know how you’ll get to the CNPP? I’ve heard there’s no direct route there now.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_324"><text>Uh... Actually no, but it’s alright, I’ll find a way — wouldn’t be the first time.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_325"><text>Let me save you some time. I know that shortly before his disappearance, Strelok visited Pripyat, where he spoke with a certain Lebed the Liaison. This guy runs all the fanatics in the city. I suppose that since they guard the approaches to the station, they must know how to get there most easily and quickly. Something tells me this Lebed won’t refuse to share this information with you.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_326"><text>Sounds reasonable. Pripyat, then Pripyat. Yes, one last question. Why did you badmouth Ivar and try to turn me against the Doctor? Part of what you said during our last meeting was an outright lie, while another part was confirmed.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_327"><text>I wanted to see how you’d react. I told you I had several theories about you and wasn’t completely sure who I was dealing with. Consider it just a test.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_328"><text>Uh-huh. I’ll pretend I believed you. Alright, it’s time for me to get ready for the road. I wouldn’t advise you to trail after me. I’m not a “key”, whatever you may think. I sincerely hope we won’t meet again.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_329"><text>Who knows how it will all turn out. It may yet happen that you yourself will come looking for a meeting with me.\nAh, yes, one more thing. If you remember, I told you that I managed to make copies of files from Strelok’s flash drive, which he forgot in one of our hideouts. So, among other things, there was a map with marked locations of stash placements at the CNPP. Who made them and when, I don’t know, but they may come in very handy for you.\nThat’s it, I wish you good luck! I hope you have enough strength to go this path to the end.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_401"><text>Putting off the inevitable?</text></string>

<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_0"><text>I wanted to tell you about Fang. I thought you might find it interesting. You’ve been in harness with him for a long time, right?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_1"><text>Well, basically yes. Sakharov has already had time to complain to me that you lost some device that was issued to you to get Fang to the surface and deliver him to the scientists. But I still didn’t fully understand: did you help Fang or not?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_2"><text>I helped. But not in the way the professor would have liked. I sent him to the Foggy Thicket, to the Doctor.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_3"><text>What? So he’s still here, in the Zone?!</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_4"><text>Well, yes. He’s lying low in a cave. He picked it out for his needs a long time ago and knows it like the back of his hand. So he’s quite comfortable there... if that word is appropriate in his circumstances. I think sooner or later the Doctor will find a way to cure him. Or he and Ivar will figure something out together.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_5"><text>Yeah... That’s some help, alright. The scientists offered you a real option to save him. Fang could have been taken beyond the perimeter and handled by real specialists. And here what chances does he have? Some kind uncle brings a miracle artifact and everything goes back to normal? Ah well... What’s done is done.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_6"><text>I know those specialists — I’ve seen enough of them already. Successors of Doctor Mengele. And what did you yourself do for Fang? You knew for sure from the Doctor that he was at Agroprom. Did you go to Sakharov for advice or come up with something useful? Did you even drop by once to see how he was doing, to cheer him up a bit? Pfah... You’d better keep quiet than criticize others.</text></string>

<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_0"><text>Ivar, I’ve got business with you. Do you remember you let slip that I remind you of someone?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_1"><text>Did I say that? No. I don’t remember...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_2"><text>I met with Ghost. And he claims that you know me. More than that — that it was you who brought me to Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_3"><text>What?! No! I don’t know what games Ghost is playing or why he’s slandering me, but...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_4"><text>What “but”? Finish your thought. You did recognize me, didn’t you? I was one of your patients? Beyond the perimeter? Or already here, in the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_5"><text>Calm down, friend. Yes, you really did remind me of someone, but now, when things in my head have cleared up a bit, I’m increasingly doubting that it could have been you.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_6"><text>That won’t do. Tell it in order.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_7"><text>All right. Once I arranged to meet Strelok in the Red Forest. He wanted to clarify something regarding the materials I had passed on to him concerning the effects of the “Black Mark” on the bearer’s body. I, as you can imagine, also had questions for him. When I arrived at the meeting place, to my surprise it turned out that Strelok hadn’t come alone. Ghost was with him, and another unfamiliar stalker. All three of them were sitting by the campfire, and when Strelok noticed me, he stood up to meet me and immediately led me aside. Apparently, he didn’t want the others to overhear our conversation.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_8"><text>That third stalker — that was me, right?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_9"><text>Dusk was already falling, so I couldn’t really make him out properly. He was sitting half-turned away from me, his head lowered. On top of that, part of his face was hidden by the hood of his suit.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_10"><text>And still?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_11"><text>I already told you: I think it wasn’t you. There was some resemblance, but nothing more. From that angle and in that lighting, anyone could have been mistaken for someone else.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_12"><text>Then why, in that conversation of ours, did you exclaim something like “you can’t be him”? By your own words now, it turns out there was no reason for such categorical statements.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_13"><text>All right... I’ll tell you. That man... he looked extremely exhausted. And in general it seemed to me that he behaved overly listlessly, like a somnambulist. These and some other details of his appearance indicated that he’d had the bad luck to “catch” the notorious “Black Mark”. I think Strelok wanted to conduct some kind of experiment on him...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_14"><text>Why did you decide that?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_15"><text>When I was approaching the campfire, Strelok was animatedly arguing with Ghost about the psychomatrix and either the transfer of consciousness or the overlaying of one consciousness onto another. Only fragments of phrases reached me, but the general sense of the conversation, as I understood it, boiled down to Strelok trying to convince Ghost to test some theory of his in practice. At the same time, either one or the other would alternately point a finger or nod in the direction of the third stalker, and he didn’t react at all, as if none of it concerned him.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_16"><text>Well I’ll be damned! And what kind of theory did Strelok have? You didn’t ask him about it?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_17"><text>I asked in passing, but he just waved it off. Said he’d tell me sometime later, that he didn’t have time right now. And indeed, after talking about urgent matters, they immediately started getting ready to move out. And I headed back to our camp. I remember hearing, just before I left, how Ghost asked Strelok: “Are you sure this can only be done in the Thicket?” After that meeting I saw Strelok one more time, but I’ve already told you about that. Then I was completely consumed by the idea that the increase in strange mental disorders beyond the perimeter was connected with the operation of the “Brain Scorcher”, and I didn’t try to learn more about Strelok’s experiments.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_18"><text>I see. And you decided that that... “test subject” was most likely already a goner anyway, having caught the “Black Mark”, and after Strelok’s experiments — all the more so. And here I am, seemingly alive and kicking, standing in front of you, pestering you with questions. Which means I can’t be that man. There’s logic in that. But what if Strelok actually did manage to somehow swap consciousness with that stalker? Fully or partially. And the “mark” jumped to him. You yourself told me how he strove to obtain it in order to become “one of his own” for the Monolith...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_19"><text>Yeah... if Ghost’s goal was to confuse you, then he definitely succeeded. You’ve got quite the imagination, Marked One. That’s quite a twist you’ve put on my words...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_20"><text>Wait! Let me finish the thought. It turns out that if you really didn’t mistake me, and it truly was me you saw back then, and then Strelok did something to me because of which I lost my memory... Am I just the result of his failed experiment? Or was it a success after all?! He got what he was aiming for, do you think?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_21"><text>Your suspiciousness will get you killed one day, Marked One. For the tenth time I repeat: I think it was another person. And Ghost is deliberately trying to generate as much white noise as possible, feeding you far-fetched versions. I can’t for the life of me understand why he’s doing this.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_22"><text>Yeah, yeah, sure. And here I was racking my brain over where these strange “memories” came from and why I doubt that they’re mine... Turns out it could easily be that none of it is mine at all. And how am I even supposed to understand now whose is whose in my head? Maybe I’m just going crazy, huh, Ivar?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_23"><text>Pull yourself together at last! As a specialist, I assure you: you show no signs of insanity whatsoever.\nYes, the Doctor correctly noted that you’re highly suggestible. Under no circumstances should you be pushed toward any particular idea — you must arrive at everything yourself...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_24"><text>The Doctor talked to you about me?! You discussed my... what do you doctors call it... case? And what did the council of learned men decide in my regard?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_25"><text>I don’t understand your sarcasm. The Doctor is genuinely very worried about you. He asked for advice.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_26"><text>And what advice did you give him?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_27"><text>Basically, I only confirmed the correctness of the strategy initially chosen. You needed to be shielded from direct suggestion, only given a general direction, attempts made to bring you together with old acquaintances, to persuade you to visit places you’d been to before, in order to subtly push your consciousness toward searching for your inner “I”.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_28"><text>Well, thanks. You pushed it so well it nearly smashed its face when it fell.\nAll right, I’ll go talk to the Doctor now. It’s time to decide something already...</text></string>

<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_0"><text>Doctor, I need to have a serious talk with you. I met with Ghost.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_1"><text>Is that so? I was racking my brain over how to let Ghost know that he should finally reach out to you. And it turns out you managed to talk without my “matchmaking” after all. Very good.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_2"><text>What’s so good about it? He told me such things... For example, that it was Ivar who brought me to Strelok. That I had supposedly been his patient back there, beyond the perimeter. That I drank without drying out until one day I snapped and killed my family. Then I ended up in a madhouse and escaped from there into the Zone. He also said that you know a lot about me, but are keeping quiet.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_3"><text>What nonsense?! Of course, I don’t know your past, but I’m certain he clearly made up that biography. I’ve seen many people in my lifetime, and believe me, you don’t look like a drunkard wastrel, nor a deranged psycho, let alone a murderer.\nAs for Strelok... As far as I know, Strelok merely consulted Ivar on some questions from his field of expertise. Something about the connection between mental disorders and the artifact known as the “Black Mark”. Ivar is a doctor. He would never put his patient in danger by agreeing to...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_4"><text>Why did you stop? By agreeing to what? To Strelok’s experiment? Yes, yes, I already know about that too. Before coming to you, I talked to Ivar. He told me about a strange stalker he saw in the company of Strelok and Ghost. It seems the poor guy had the bad luck to get hit with the “Black Mark”, and Strelok was planning to conduct some kind of experiment on him. When I met Ivar in the Bar after the trip to the “Brain Scorcher”, he seemed to recognize that unfortunate stalker in me, but later backed out, saying he must have been mistaken.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_5"><text>I see you’ve indeed found out quite a lot, only you’re drawing the wrong conclusions. It seems Ghost deliberately decided to confuse you. But for what purpose, I’d really like to know?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_6"><text>Don’t steer the conversation aside. What do you know about Strelok’s experiment and my — or perhaps not my — role in it?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_7"><text>All right. I suppose there really is no point in continuing to hide this now. I don’t know exactly what experiments Strelok was conducting or what exactly he was trying to achieve. I do know there were several of them, and they all took place in the Foggy Thicket, near the ravine at the bottom of which stands the “dead Monolith”. It’s a huge crystal around which all instruments that measure the intensity of the psi-field go off the scale. Some believe that it is a fragment of that very legendary Monolith...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_8"><text>To hell with the Monolith! Get to the point.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_9"><text>Don’t get so worked up, Marked One. I’m getting to the essence. One day the whole trio showed up at my hut: Fang, Ghost, and Strelok. I knew that the day before they had once again been fiddling with some equipment near the “dead Monolith”, so their appearance didn’t surprise me. What did surprise me was that they were carrying another person on improvised stretchers. He was unconscious. And that was you, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_10"><text>So it’s true after all... And what happened next?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_11"><text>According to Strelok, shortly after completing the tests of some installation assembled by Fang according to his design, they found a stalker unconscious within its area of effect, showing signs of psi-radiation damage. Apparently, it was an absurd accident. You were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_12"><text>Or very much the opposite — in exactly the right place, at exactly the right time. So what about the transfer or overlaying of consciousness, huh, Doc?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_13"><text>What did you say? Transfer of consciousness? Are you serious? Is that even possible? Did Ghost spin that tale for you too?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_14"><text>No, Ivar. He managed to partially overhear an argument between Strelok and Ghost. That’s exactly what it was about. True, Ivar was far away and didn’t catch everything... And why did I even assume that Strelok was going to experiment on that stalker? Just because Ivar saw that pair nodding in his direction?!</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_15"><text>There you go. You’re already starting to doubt yourself. A vivid confirmation of how easily you succumb to manipulation and suggestion. Now imagine how you would have reacted if I had immediately told you everything I knew. Would you have believed me?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_16"><text>The question is different: should I believe what you’re saying now? It seems I’m completely tangled up... All right, I’ll listen to your version to the end. What happened after they brought me to your hut?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_17"><text>Strelok almost immediately said his goodbyes and went off on his own business, instructing Ghost to take care of you. It seems he felt guilty about the misfortune that had befallen you. I gave you first aid and asked Ghost and Fang to carry you to a safer place, where you lay recovering for quite a long time. By the way, you were there later, after your recovery. It’s the group’s secret hideout in the underground tunnels of Agroprom. From my observations, recovery after a strong psi-strike proceeds the faster the closer the victim is to the borders of the Zone, but in your case, for some reason, everything went rather slowly, so we took turns watching over you: me, Fang, and Ghost.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_18"><text>So that’s why I had the feeling I’d already been there before... And I knew how to get into the hideout itself. But no details stuck in my head. Wait! But I was found by Ginger near that truck on the Cordon... How?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_19"><text>Honestly? I don’t know. That day I was sitting with you, but after receiving an urgent request for help from an acquaintance, I was forced to leave my watch for a short while. I don’t know what made you get up and make your way out of the underground tunnels... There was a powerful emission then, one of the strongest I can remember. Maybe it affected you somehow, or you simply came to for a time and went on “autopilot” in a familiar direction, or something else... Be that as it may, when I returned, you were already gone without a trace. The next day I was informed that you had been found on the Cordon, and I went there. Thus was born the legend of the lone survivor from the “death truck”. In the village, when you gradually started coming to your senses, we properly met for the first time. The rest you already know.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_20"><text>Well, your version sounds fairly plausible, but don’t take it amiss, I’m no longer going to take anything on faith. It seems I have no other choice but to keep heading north. I hope there I’ll finally understand why Strelok was so drawn there, and perhaps even find him himself.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_21"><text>You’re talking about the Monolith? But...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_22"><text>Yes, I know, I know. Strelok most likely wanted to destroy it. Everything points to that. But either he failed, or... his goal was different after all.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_23"><text>I can’t vouch for Strelok, but Ghost definitely held a different point of view — that the Monolith must not be destroyed under any circumstances. They argued about this more than once. I think Ghost secretly dreams of putting the Monolith to work for himself, and therefore gathers any information about it that he can. Perhaps he wouldn’t mind persuading you to go to the Monolith, in order to observe from the sidelines what would come of it.\nIn any case, whatever you’re planning, I wish you luck, Marked One! This will be your most dangerous foray into the Zone — prepare yourself thoroughly and finish all your business. Who knows what awaits you there. It’s not worth dragging along the burden of unfulfilled promises and unsolved mysteries.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_241"><text>The main mystery for me is who I really am. It’s time to grab Ghost firmly by the throat. Farewell.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_242"><text>The main mystery for me is who I really am. It’s time to grab Ghost firmly by the throat. And I’d like to see Fang one last time as well — then I’m off. Farewell.</text></string>

<string id="final_common_dialog_0"><text>Doctor? What’s happening? How did I end up in the Foggy Thicket?</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_1"><text>I thought you’d tell me what you were doing here. There was a bright flash on the other side of the hill. I went to check it out and found you near the “dead Monolith”.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_2"><text>But how did I get there? So does that mean it transported me?!</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_3"><text>I don’t understand you at all, Marked One. Who transported you? You were heading on a raid to the north, weren’t you?</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_4"><text>Yes... And I managed to repeat Strelok’s path by visiting the CNPP. There I found his notes and thought I could reach the Monolith using them. In the end, I found myself in some underground complex, but all the passages there were completely sealed. Then I noticed a teleport bubble, stepped into it, and ended up here...</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_5"><text>Incredible! You came closer to the secret of the Monolith than anyone else! If we don’t count Strelok himself, of course.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_6"><text>It seems to me that Strelok also failed to unravel it. Something didn’t let him through. Just like me, as it happens... But I understood everything. Or almost everything. True... it no longer matters.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_7"><text>Are you still angry with me? Don’t you want to share what was revealed to you there?</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_8"><text>No, I’m no longer angry. You did the right thing. If you had told me everything you knew about me right away, I probably wouldn’t have dared to follow Strelok’s trail to the end — I wouldn’t have had the nerve. And so I would still be stuck in confusion, doubt, and self-examination. But now... what’s happened has happened. Nothing can be fixed anyway, nothing can be changed. Strelok understood this too, I think. And he left. Completely.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_9"><text>Are you sure? How do you know?</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_10"><text>I told you, I found his notes. His last notes, I think. I don’t know where he came from or where he is now, but here, in the Zone, he definitely isn’t. If he was from the future, he could have returned back, to his own time. Or to some other one. He came to terms with the fact that it’s impossible to change the past, no matter how hard you try, no matter what technologies you possess. You can’t change cause and effect. All his attempts were doomed from the start, and now we all have to live with this Zone and with this Monolith one way or another. And as for me... I have a feeling that my last trip wasn’t in vain.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_11"><text>What do you mean?</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_12"><text>I remembered myself. Now I know for sure: I am not him. I am not Strelok, and there is not a single one of his memories, or an imprint of his consciousness, or anything of the sort in me. But Ghost, it seems to me, is still convinced of that.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_13"><text>I’m very happy for you. It’s wonderful that you finally found yourself, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_14"><text>Yes... And although my memory hasn’t fully returned to me yet, something has been remembered, something is only just beginning to emerge, as if from the fog, but that’s not the main thing. The point is that now I clearly know: everything that’s in my head is mine and no one else’s. All my mistakes are mine, all my failures are mine, and all the consequences of the decisions I’ve made... In short, you probably can’t imagine what it’s like to feel like a whole and free individual, rather than a puppet in someone else’s hands or a spineless appendage to some unknown... entities.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_15"><text>Tell me about yourself, then. I think you need to speak your mind.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_16"><text>Yes... Wait a little.</text></string>

<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_0"><text>Sanek, do you happen to have any special artifacts?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_1"><text>Special — like what, for example? Are Dummies no longer special for you? </text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_2"><text>Not Dummies. Or maybe they are Dummies, who knows... Anyway, what I need is specifically this: </text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_3"><text>Hmm... You’re a gourmet. Collecting? Or did someone ask you to find them?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_4"><text>Doesn’t matter. It’s for a job, I really need it.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_5"><text>I’m afraid a collection like that will cost you a pretty penny... or rather, artifacts. Maybe I can find such things, but you understand — it’s a custom order, not a simple one.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_6"><text>Alright, down to business. How much and when?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_7"><text>If we’re being brief, my business-minded friend, then in just a couple of hours some guy promised to bring something like that. You might get lucky and it’ll be just what’s in your collection. But it’ll cost you each one for a... Dummy.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_8"><text>Sanek — are you serious?!</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_9"><text>I warned you I’d charge a lot. Rarity...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_10"><text>I’ll come back later, if you don’t run off. If not, I’ll find you later. Maybe we can haggle at least for one.</text></string>

<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_0"><text>So, what about the order?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_1"><text>Too early. Come back a bit later.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_11"><text>Alright. Later it is.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_2"><text>You’re lucky, Marked One, like a drowned man... I’ve got exactly the artifacts you asked for. Will you take them all at once, or one at a time?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_21"><text>It’s a shame to spend Dummies on this. I’ll think about it some more...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_3"><text>I’ve got Dummies. Let’s take a look.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_4"><text>Choose: </text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_5"><text>I’ll take only the first one. Here’s the Dummy.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_6"><text>I’ll take only the second one. Here’s the Dummy.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_7"><text>I’ll take only the third one. Here’s the Dummy.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_8"><text>A successful deal. If you need others — come by.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_9"><text>We’ll see.</text></string>

<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_0"><text>Sanek, help me out. I urgently need one specific artifact — “Mama’s Beads”.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_1"><text>Urgently, huh? I don’t have one myself... But I know who can get it. If we agree on the price, it’ll be delivered from the Army Warehouses in about three hours.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_2"><text>Excellent. What do you want for it?</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_3"><text>You see, lately the route to the Army Warehouses, where I also do business, has become downright unsafe. Folks say bloodsuckers even lie in wait along the road. And how’s a loner supposed to fend them off? Right — grenades. And best of all underbarrel ones, to stir things up from a distance. The problem is, I’ve got neither an underbarrel launcher nor grenades. Get me a GP-25 and about 20 VOGs for it — and we’ve got a deal. If not, then no deal.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_41"><text>I expected you’d jack up the price, but this... Alright, I don’t have much choice. I’ll get you the underbarrel and the VOGs, but make sure the Beads are already here in no more than three hours. And don’t you dare run off somewhere yourself.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_42"><text>Are you out of your mind? I’ll do without your “tempting” deal.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_5"><text>Good. I’ll send you a message when it’s time to come pick up the order, if you don’t show up yourself by the appointed time.</text></string>

<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_done_dlg_0"><text>I’m here for the “Beads”.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_done_dlg_1"><text>Yeah, here they are, waiting. Show me the underbarrel. It’s decent, right? Not rusted through?</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_done_dlg_21"><text>It’s fine, it’s fine. Take the grenades too. You can check it yourself later.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_done_dlg_22"><text>So... Where did I put it? Stay here, I’ll be right back.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_done_dlg_3"><text>I’ll check, as is customary. If I took everyone at their word, I’d have gone under in this business long ago. Alright, here’s the artifact. Deal’s done.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_done_dlg_4"><text>Take care.</text></string>

<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_0"><text>Voron, do you happen to have any special artifacts?</text></string>

<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_2"><text>Well, people bring you all sorts of collectible items. Maybe rare artifacts too... Anyway, I need something very specific like this: </text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_3"><text>Hm... You’re a gourmet. Collecting yourself? Or did someone ask you to find them?</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_4"><text>Doesn’t matter. They’ll come in handy for a certain job.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_5"><text>I’m afraid such a collectible rarity will cost you a pretty penny... or rather, coupons. I might be able to find them, but you understand — it’s a custom order, not an easy one...</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_6"><text>Alright, down to business. How much and when?</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_7"><text>If we keep it short, my business-minded friend, then literally in a couple of hours one guy promised to bring something like that. Maybe you’ll get lucky and it’ll be exactly what you need for your collection. But each one will cost you... a thousand greens. That is, total: three grand US.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_8"><text>You’re such a... bloodsucker.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_9"><text>It’s not us... it’s life. I warned you it’d be expensive.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_10"><text>Alright. I’ll come back later, maybe we’ll haggle at least for one. Or maybe Sanyok the trader will have something like that.</text></string>

<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_0"><text>So, what about the order?</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_1"><text>You came too early. Come back a bit later.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_11"><text>Alright. Later it is.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_2"><text>You’re lucky, Marked One, like a drowned man... I’ve got exactly the artifacts you need. You got the money?</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_21"><text>Pity to spend coupons on this. I’ll think about it some more...</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_3"><text>Of course! Let’s take a look at what you’ve got.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_4"><text>Choose: </text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_5"><text>I’ll take the first one. Here’s the coupon.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_6"><text>I’ll take the second one. Here’s the coupon.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_7"><text>I’ll take the third one. Here’s the coupon.</text></string>

<string id="strelok_book_news_0"><text>...there will arise a need for the maximum possible number of such formations; however, the scarcity of reliable information does not allow for a thorough study, and we resemble medieval alchemists in search of the philosopher’s stone... \n 
...One of our analysts has put forward a rather interesting hypothesis. In short, its essence is as follows: the Object, as we know from indirect data and the attempts of our researchers, is shielded by a nonlinear distortion field of the space-time continuum. The opposite polarity and the extremely complex generated ionic flow are akin to that observed in so-called "teleports". There are a number of discrepancies here, but its function is analogous to directed displacement, albeit with elements of tolerance... \n 
...Put more simply, it can be taken as a basis that this is a teleport in the sense already familiar to us, but with a certain activation key. Moreover, this is not a primitive rebalance of a field disturbed by the presence of organic matter, nor is it an anomaly triggered by the presence of a specific direct influence of some physical component. This is precisely a selection, or rather an "assembly", of quite specific anomalous formations. At one time, such formations were mistakenly called artifacts, but by now it is clear to everyone that they are not a product of purposeful human activity... \n 
...Thus, we have information about certain "assemblies". It indirectly confirms our attempts to crack the ionic coding of the Object in the presence of parametric foundations according to the Fateev–Bazhov hypothesis.\n 
...As a result, we can say that the risk is justified. The intermediate stability of a logically unfolded chain of atomic masses has already been confirmed as a variant of docking dispersion of elements for the creation of a directed generated ionic flow with refraction at the hysteresis point. And this is the good news. The bad news is that we will have to switch to autonomous field tests.\n
...Continue working with samples No. 2, 6, 8, 9, 11... and connect a couple more with low weight in accordance with the atomic-molecular scale... \n
...It already resembles a breakthrough; it is now possible to compile a numbered table and describe the sequences for assembling elementary chains. The mathematical analysis conducted by the logistics group identified four closest chains with a number of elements ranging from two to five. Variant No. 1. With a high degree of probability, it is based on five elements; we will test it first. No less interesting is variant No. 2 — four elements. This is the priority for the upcoming sessions. Variant No. 3 of three elements is, in principle, also possible. If, however, you manage to create a chain of only two elements, then honor and praise to you! \n
... \n
Thus. 1. The required anomalous formations are needed. 2. Their required combination is needed. 3. Total weight 15 kg +/- 100 g. 4. A point of entry into the required teleport is needed... That is sufficient!
</text></string>

<string id="strelok_book_news_1"><text>Damn, damn and damn!!! Everything is pointless again. Everything is there, the right teleport has been found, but it won’t let me through! So close. The solution was almost found, all that remained was to find the path. And now it exists. And what? I can’t pass... I’m tired. So much time, so much effort, and all for nothing... \n \n
And so many victims... \n \n
What other victims? It is I who sacrificed my entire comfortable life, and I sacrificed my health, everything, all for this. I am the real victim. But I am ready for more. If only... After all, they were right — the “Black Mark” is the main key, and the assembly is only an addition. Or the second option — a Monolith-type consciousness implant. Neither is available to me. I would gladly sacrifice myself, but I am not allowed to. \n \n
Then why didn’t you tell Ghost about the “Mark”? He would have gotten infected for such an occasion... \n \n
You understand nothing. He immediately caught fire with that idea, I saw it myself. And it was obvious that he would use this opportunity for himself, to benefit personally. His goals were clear from the very beginning. But I needed him. Only he could believe me. And I needed him as a connoisseur of the Zone, and for searching artifacts. A real psycho... \n \n
Who are you talking about now? About him or... \n \n
About him, of course. Only a madman could come up with something like that. Ghost imagined himself the arbiter of human destinies, wanted to become a new Messiah who would come to people in the past and turn the entire course of history upside down, relying on knowledge of the future... To make himself a living god, to create a cult of himself. That could not be allowed. \n \n
Listen to the way you talk... And what about yourself? \n \n
No! Everything is not like that!.. But how conveniently and timely that guy fell into the Foggy Thicket. I had no idea where he came from. And I deliberately invented that story about a possible overlap of consciousness in order to finally get rid of Ghost. He only became an obstacle and would not leave my side for a single step — but what could he have done next? He would have ruined my entire plan with his delusional ideas... And this way — he swallowed the hook, decided that he could pull something out of that guy, something “mine” from his consciousness. And I was finally able to disappear... \n \n
Yeah... a good hook. Once again you set someone up. And you didn’t care what would happen to him, or what Ghost might do while pulling “your” information out of him... \n \n
You’re lying! I didn’t set anyone up. Just... a little false data. For the cause. \n \n
Of course, for the cause. And what about those stalkers you fed lies to? Also “a little false data for the cause”? Remember how you sent them to turn on the installation. They were na?ve... \n \n
It wasn’t like that!!! \n \n
...they bought it. And of course no one came out of there. Or maybe they are still wandering there, mooing, pressing their foreheads against the walls? How about your conscience — doesn’t it torment you? \n \n
What do you know about conscience? The existence of humanity is at stake! And I bear responsibility for all mankind. That is my conscience. \n \n
Right. And the ends, of course, justify the means... Remember Fang. You didn’t tell him everything when you sent him, did you? \n \n
I told him everything he needed to know. And he did everything. What happened was an accident, a coincidence of circumstances. \n \n
Uh-huh... Of course. That’s exactly what you told the Doctor. By the way, about the Doctor. Wasn’t it you who hinted to someone that he knew too much? \n \n
What are you talking about?! We were talking... about something else. \n \n
And Ivar? You didn’t know that he might not make it out? \n \n
He wanted it himself. I certainly didn’t send Ivar anywhere. Don’t pin Ivar on me as well. He knew what he was getting into. \n \n
Exactly. He figured out right away that he might not make it out and laid low, but sent others instead. And now they are also on your conscience. As well as Ivar himself. And everyone else, all for the sake of a “great” goal. \n \n
No! Do not attribute to me what I did not do! You know nothing about my goal! \n \n
I know as much as you do. Your “great” goal would not have existed if you yourself had not become the reason it became necessary. So, my friend, face reality — if you still can. If you decided to take responsibility for humanity, then you and only you are responsible for everything: for all those victims, for all the chaos that will happen there and later. All of this is the result of your actions here and now. \n \n
Shut up! Everything is not like that. It cannot be like that... \n \n
So truthful? The truth is sometimes cruel... The path to truth is not always pleasant. \n \n
Shut up already!!! \n \n
Or what? Will you kill me? Hm... try it. Just another small victim for the sake of a “great goal”. You’re used to it. \n \n
SHUT UP!!! \n \n

<string id="rad_mil_cook_start_dialog_103"><text>I’m waiting for my buddies. They’ll soon be dragging bags of loot from the north. Although, they’re taking a long time. Maybe they got stuck there, or can’t haul such a heavy load.</text></string>
<string id="rad_mil_cook_start_dialog_104"><text>That’s the thing — the load there is a strange one. You might not end up waiting for them.</text></string>
<string id="rad_mil_cook_start_dialog_201"><text>Still hanging around here? Without you, all the loot in the north will be scooped up. Watch it, you might miss out.</text></string>

<string id="semena_task_description"><text>For the Monolithians to point the way to the "Monolith", you need to plant the "shoots" at the points of energy release. Namely: throw special artifacts into the "Matrix" anomaly on the Radar, in the Raycenter, and in the "Tesla" zone. Don’t lose them — they won’t give you any more.</text></string>

<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_0"><text>I have received your call.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_1"><text>You have done a great deed, fulfilled what was destined.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_2"><text>How do you know what I’ve done? I haven’t reported anything yet.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_3"><text>There is a connection, I feel His breath. People speak much and do little. You are one of them. But you acted.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_4"><text>Well... here we go again. Let’s keep it simple. That “breath” isn’t as important to me as it is to you, and I don’t really need “His” attention either. Those are your problems. I only need to know how to go further, to the station. That’s all.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_5"><text>The paths are always open, but not everyone is allowed to pass. There is a path nearby, beyond the field.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_6"><text>What do you mean?! So I could have passed anyway — without your seeds? Even from here somewhere, from Pripyat? Just like that?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_7"><text>His breath will not allow you to overcome it. It is not simple. A human is weak, he will not pass there. And it will not let anyone near without a gift. You made the gift. You will be accepted, but not there.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_8"><text>No need to accept me anywhere... So I won’t make it beyond the field. Then where can I pass? Is there another way?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_9"><text>You call it the "Tesla" zone. A labyrinth. Pass through it and you will be where you strive to go.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_10"><text>I’ve heard something about the “Labyrinth”... That’s where that bubble is, right? But “Tesla” is a place too — not for the weak either. It fries you with electricity.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_101"><text>Not now. There will be three days of calm. You will be able to pass.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_102"><text>Three days? Hm... Well, if I manage to get ready, I’ll try to pass. That area has been drawing me for a long time, but I never managed to explore it properly.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_11"><text>Go to Him. And you will know.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_12"><text>What’s it to you anyway? Even if I go, so what? I don’t understand your interest in me.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_13"><text>You were marked. It is His interest. Not mine. Humans cannot understand. Each unit of consciousness marked by Him is important to Him.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_14"><text>I’m afraid that with “Him” there I might end up with zero consciousness altogether... And there will be no “unit” of yours. I need to weigh everything and prepare. I feel there may be no way back.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_15"><text>You are on the right path. You strive for truth. Do not lose sight of it. Do not turn away. I will show a short path.</text></string>

<string id="docent_scarman_start_dialog_2"><text>Look, seems like something is encrypted.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_start_dialog_3"><text>Let me see... doesn’t really look like proper encryption. I have a feeling it’s more like an imitation of real ciphering, because I don’t see any special software here, and it’s too... “out in the open”, so to speak. Someone made a simple foolproof protection. Meaning, in theory, it’s some kind of combination of symbols, the key to which the owner knew. Logically, the key itself should be simple. Anyway, I think it’s not hard, but I really don’t have time right now — I’m swamped.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_start_dialog_4"><text>If it’s all so simple, why bother complicating things at all?</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_start_dialog_5"><text>Maybe it points to some place, or a name, which the owner stored this way so he could remember it himself if needed, but others wouldn’t understand it at a casual glance... Leave it here, I’ll run it through one tricky program now and we’ll see what comes out. Meanwhile, think about how to gild Docent’s pen. A second-tier artifact will be enough. Just make sure it’s not stale. I need a fresh one to test an idea.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_start_dialog_6"><text>Work your magic, you’ll get your artifact.</text></string>

<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_1"><text>And where is the payment for my intellectual labor?</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_21"><text>Oh, you miser. Of course I brought it — where would I go.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_22"><text>You said it was simple. But you charged like it was the secret of the “Monolith”.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_31"><text>Come on, I don’t think you’ll be at a loss.\nWrite this down: "Stash in the Red Forest — backpack in the old mine, in the large hall".</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_32"><text>Come on, I don’t think you’ll be at a loss.\nWrite this down: "Stash in the Red Forest — backpack in the valley, by the rocks, near the cave entrance".</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_33"><text>Come on, I don’t think you’ll be at a loss.\nWrite this down: "Stash in the Red Forest — backpack in the valley, under a tree, next to a strange crater".</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_4"><text>That’s it? No more information?</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_5"><text>What else did you want? A list of items in the stash, or the revelation of all the Zone’s secrets?</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_61"><text>Maybe something more specific. Though... oh well. You say Red Forest and a mine... I think I know where that is.</text></string>

<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_7"><text>Don’t forget about poor Docent if the stash is rich. And I’ll keep the PDA, if you don’t mind. There’s nothing useful left in it anyway. Drinks are on me.</text></string>

I don’t remember more, we’d had a bit too much. By the way, there’s a guy in that forest, Valera — a ranger of sorts. Talk to him, he knows the forest well. But I’ll tell you this — forget it, it’s a dead place. That forest is crawling with monsters. Even experienced stalkers try to steer clear of it.</text></string>
<string id="prut_red_x16_dialog_6"><text>In the Red Forest, then.</text></string>

<string id="greens_voda_dialog_0"><text>Can I get some water from you?</text></string>
<string id="greens_voda_dialog_1"><text>We don’t have any spare water right now. We’re conserving it ourselves. We need water to wash entrails, it’s required for production. And anyway...</text></string>
<string id="greens_voda_dialog_2"><text>Alright, I’ll fill up at the Cordon.</text></string>
<string id="greens_voda_dialog_11"><text>We’re conserving it ourselves... But you did us such a favor with curing the hides. Fine, go ahead and fill up at the washbasin. Free of charge, for now.</text></string>
<string id="greens_voda_dialog_22"><text>Well, at least something’s free.</text></string>

<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_0"><text>So what about that stalker who was lying in your barracks?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_1"><text>The one who was mumbling about Krivoy? Or whatever his name was...</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_2"><text>Ryaboy.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_3"><text>Right, that’s it. Well, it’s all over now. You could tell he wouldn’t last long. Did you meet that Ryaboy?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_4"><text>Well, not exactly met him. He perished too. As Diodor says, we pay for our sins — a sad but expected end for people like him.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_5"><text>That’s still unclear whose sin was greater there. Our wounded man turned out to be quite a piece of work too.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_6"><text>Meaning?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_71"><text>Right before he died, Diodor happened to be here and went in to see him. So the man asked him for confession. Well, he dictated it to him — or rather whispered it, as best he could. A bit disjointed, but the picture is clear.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_72"><text>One stalker asked us for a place to stay the night. And it turned out we put him in the same barracks as the wounded man — there was no space elsewhere. So, get this, that stalker recognized him. The nameless one passed away a couple of hours later, and in the morning the man told our guys a curious story.\nHe said that a few days ago he crawled into an adit in the Red Forest to wait out a downpour. After some time he hears someone coming. He kept quiet and started watching. Sees two guys. They sit down to drink, talking quietly. Then one of them suddenly opens fire and unloads a burst into the other. After that the killer rummages through the dead man’s backpack and drags the body toward the nearest carousel. Looks like he planned to get rid of the corpse, but apparently he drank too much vodka, misjudged things a bit, and flew into the anomaly himself. The storyteller waited for a while and then decided to get closer. The killer was alive, though badly mangled. While he was scratching his head over what to do next, he heard the heavy footsteps of a giant approaching. Naturally, he bolted from there at full speed, no fool. But he says he got a good look at the killer and remembered him. And in the barracks he recognized him in the nameless wounded man. That’s how it was!</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_81"><text>How do you know?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_82"><text>Well, damn! And are you sure that “witness” didn’t make it all up himself? Or didn’t mix him up with someone else? What was his name, by the way?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_91"><text>Diodor wrote that confession down right there, on the body. You were looking for Ryaboy — here you go, read it. You can keep it, there’s no point passing it on to Ryaboy now, and I don’t need it, our guys have all read it anyway.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_92"><text>Am I sure? No, of course not. I don’t know him personally at all. But why would he make up such a story? And our guys just called him by his name — Tokha.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_101"><text>I’ll read it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_102"><text>Huh... There are plenty of Tokhas in the Zone! Ryaboy is dead, and it looks like I won’t be finding the last person who saw him alive. And what would that even give me? It’s unlikely they knew each other. Another dead end. Damn...</text></string>

<string id="bar_tonnel_dialog_0"><text>So where did Ivar go?</text></string>
<string id="bar_tonnel_dialog_1"><text>What am I, your Ivar’s babysitter?</text></string>
<string id="bar_tonnel_dialog_2"><text>Well, you never know. He didn’t drop by here?</text></string>
<string id="bar_tonnel_dialog_3"><text>He did, bought a few things and left. I didn’t pry into his plans. These days everyone’s heading north, so he probably went there too.</text></string>
<string id="bar_tonnel_dialog_4"><text>I see.</text></string>

<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_0"><text>Did Ivar stop by to see you?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1"><text>He did before leaving, asked for a working PDA.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_2"><text>And where did he go?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_3"><text>Who knows? Seemed like he was going to gather what was left of his group. They searched and searched for something and never found it, only got lost themselves. But he’s back to normal now, he’ll take care of himself. Though if he really wants to find the “Black Mark”, then hardly...</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_4"><text>The Mark? What does he need it for?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_5"><text>That’s a question! How would I know? Or maybe I misunderstood him... Ivar took a hard hit after all, and his speech hasn’t fully recovered yet.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_6"><text>Strange. He mentioned that Strelok was interested in the “Black Mark”... What else did Ivar say?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_7"><text>Nothing really, said goodbye and that was it. Mumbled something like “Strelok might have been right” or something along those lines. I was busy, you know? Didn’t listen too closely.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_81"><text>Did you ever talk with him about flooded tunnels and pumps? Maybe not this time, but earlier? Or maybe you yourself know something about it? Found something like that in papers or on a PDA... No?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_82"><text>Did you ever talk with him about flooded tunnels and pumps? Maybe not this time, but earlier?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_91"><text>We didn’t talk about anything like that with Ivar, but... I think I came across references to documentation on this topic... If memory serves, it should be searched for in the underground laboratory with index X-12. And why do you need all this, if it’s not a secret?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_92"><text>Definitely not. As far as I remember, something like that flashed by in the papers you brought me recently. So you really got the urge to clarify this topic in more detail?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_101"><text>Just want to check one guess. Thanks for the tip, Docent. I’ll go get ready for the road...</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1021"><text>Yeah, I did. So will you help? This is extremely important to me right now.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1022"><text>Yeah, I did. Listen, I helped you with your financial problems, so now you return the favor. This is extremely important to me right now.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_103"><text>And it’s extremely important for me to sort out my financial problems. By the way, I already stated my price on this matter — two third-tier artifacts in good condition. Forgot, didn’t you?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1032"><text>Well... Yes, of course, I’ll help however I can. I’ll still owe you anyway.\nWait a bit, I’ll check my notes on the laptop. All info that might be of interest to me or to those who regularly come to me, like you for example, I prefer to convert into electronic format.\nOh-ho... I don’t want to upset you, Marked One, but I can’t really tell you anything particularly useful about the tunnel-pumps. Except that control of the power supply and control of the pumps themselves are carried out from different locations. And the pumping installations themselves are located somewhere in a third place altogether. Something like that...</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_10411"><text>With you around, you’d forget how indeed. You never miss a chance to remind me how much I owe you. Here are the artifacts, satisfied?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_10412"><text>Didn’t forget, didn’t forget. You’ll get your artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1042"><text>Hmph... I expected more. What use is this information to me...</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_105"><text>Quite so. Wait a bit, I’ll check my notes on the laptop. All info that might be of interest to me or to those who regularly come to me, like you for example, I prefer to convert into electronic format.\nOh-ho... I don’t want to upset you, Marked One, but I can’t really tell you anything particularly useful about the tunnel-pumps. Except that control of the power supply and control of the pumps themselves are carried out from different locations. And the pumping installations themselves are located somewhere in a third place altogether. Something like that...</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1052"><text>I understand your dissatisfaction, Marked One. I admit, I myself am baffled. It seemed to me that the last time I skimmed through the papers you brought, there was much more there... Stop! What an idiot I am! Remember how I told you that some guy tried to sell me similar documents, and I didn’t take them?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_106"><text>Are you kidding me? And I gave you two excellent artifacts for this information? That’s not how business is done, Docent...</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1062"><text>I understand your indignation, Marked One. I admit, I myself can’t make sense of how it turned out this way. It seemed to me that the last time I skimmed through the papers you brought, there was much more there... Stop! What an idiot I am! Remember how I told you that some guy tried to sell me similar documents, and I didn’t take them?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_107"><text>Oh no! Don’t tell me you mixed up which documents you found what I desperately need in now! And what am I supposed to do? What was that stalker’s name, where do I look for him now?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_108"><text>Alas, that’s the kind of blunder it was... What was his name, what was his name... I honestly don’t remember. I saw him that day for the first and last time. Where to look — no idea either. Although... there is one lead. When I politely asked him to leave, he blurted out something like “well, screw you, I’ll sell it to Tooth.” If the deal went through, then go to that trader. As far as I know, he should be in Limansk now.\nOh, and one more thing: some suspicious-looking guy was hanging around here recently. First talked to the Barman about something, then came to see me. He also asked about tunnels, underground laboratories, and some kind of tools. But I brushed him off, said I didn’t know anything. He seemed way too shady to me.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_109"><text>Aha! Tooth buys up everything, so there’s a chance. That guy’s no gift, of course, but you can deal with him. Especially if you offer the right price. All right, let’s say you helped me. And about the suspicious guy — noted. Take care.</text></string>

<string id="docent_2_tonnel_dialog_0"><text>Hi, Docent. I’m back to you again about the tunnel-pumps...</text></string>
<string id="docent_2_tonnel_dialog_11"><text>I’m busy right now... Ah, to hell with it! I’ll tear myself away from my work for a bit. I owe you anyway.\nWait a bit, I’ll check my notes on the laptop. All info that might be of interest to me or to those who regularly come to me, like you for example, I prefer to convert into electronic format.\nOh-ho... I don’t want to upset you, Marked One, but I have nothing useful to report on your question. Except that control of the power supply and control of the pumps themselves are carried out from different locations. And the pumping installations themselves are located somewhere in a third place altogether. Something like that...</text></string>
<string id="docent_2_tonnel_dialog_12"><text>I’m busy right now... Ah, to hell with it! I’ll tear myself away from my work for a bit. We agreed on two artifacts, right? Did you bring them?</text></string>
<string id="docent_2_tonnel_dialog_221"><text>Of course. Will these do?</text></string>
<string id="docent_2_tonnel_dialog_222"><text>Yeah... Where are they?! I was sure I put them in my backpack. Wait a bit, I’ll bring them soon...</text></string>

<string id="bar_merc_dialog_0"><text>So, what’s new around here?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_1"><text>What’s new... There are hardly any people left, can’t you see? Fewer and fewer every day, everyone’s heading north, and only a handful come back. Where do they all disappear to, what kind of black hole do they fall into? Have you been there yourself, or are you still just getting ready?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_2"><text>Hard to say... Feels like I was, and feels like I wasn’t.</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_3"><text>Ah, right. You’re, well — not quite right in the head. You remember some things, forget others... \nBy the way, a guy stopped by here, asking about someone with an unusual tattoo on their arm. I thought of you right away. You’ve got that distinctive mark on your wrist, don’t you?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_4"><text>Well, yeah. So what?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_5"><text>And that’s it. The guy acted all important, businesslike. Talked like he was giving orders. Ask him anything — and he snaps back that it’s none of your business, while he himself just keeps asking questions.</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_6"><text>And why would he need me?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_7"><text>Why you specifically? He didn’t name any names, and you yourself supposedly don’t even remember what your name is. Or have you remembered it already?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_8"><text>I remember everything just fine now. And I’m not sick. My name is the Marked One. I am the Marked One. Clear?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_9"><text>Alright, Marked One it is, marked by a sign... So, that’s who he needed — someone marked by the sign. I don’t recall a second one like that. Draw your own conclusions.</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_10"><text>Not enough data yet to draw conclusions. Anything else?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_11"><text>I told him I couldn’t help, that the Zone’s full of people and every second one’s probably got something tattooed. And he replied: if someone with a strange mark does turn up, tell him they’ll be waiting for him at the Warehouses, at the bus stop on the road to the Red Forest. So I’m passing that on.</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_12"><text>At the Warehouses... Must’ve been a mercenary, then.</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_13"><text>Could be. Go there and find out for yourself.</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_14"><text>Not sure I need that meeting. We’ll see how things go.</text></string>

<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_0"><text>Do you know where Ghost went?</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_1"><text>No. And I don’t want to know!</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_2"><text>Why’s that?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_3"><text>That Ghost of yours is a real operator. He brought some armed gang with him that nearly trashed the place, and then vanished without a trace.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_4"><text>You must be mistaken. Ghost is a loner, he’s not connected to any gang.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_5"><text>Well, maybe he didn’t bring them, maybe they came to him — what difference does it make. They barged in, started bossing everyone around, asking about some tools for some kind of weapon, making demands, threatening... I had to put them in their place by mentioning just a few high-ranking names overseeing our work. Before that Ghost showed up, we never had this kind of bacchanalia here. I even warned Professor Vasilyev not to get involved with such shady characters. But no! And here’s the result — Vasilyev is still in a vegetative state, and thugs are storming scientific laboratories.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_6"><text>I don’t see a connection here. And aren’t you exaggerating? Stalkers are always wandering around here, all armed, any of them can start waving weapons if they really want something. By that logic, you could call anyone a thug.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_7"><text>Manners, young man. You can tell a person by their manners, weapons or no weapons. And I won’t let that Ghost of yours even set foot on my doorstep again.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_8"><text>Will you throw him out yourself, or assign it to a graduate student?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_9"><text>No need to be sarcastic. Of course, I can’t stand up to brute force, but one thing’s certain — he won’t get anything more from me. And enough about Ghost, let’s change the subject. What brings you here? Your account is still open.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_10"><text>I don’t need anything right now.</text></string>

<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_0"><text>Semenov, can you tell me what happened here? What was all that noise, what kind of raid was it?</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_1"><text>There was no raid at all. And no real noise either, except for Sakharov’s own screeching.</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_2"><text>So who was it that came?</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_3"><text>Some well-equipped types showed up. Started questioning Sakharov, barged into his office, rummaged around on the desks without any ceremony. But no shouting, all businesslike. They were looking for something specific.</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_4"><text>So what about your security?</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_5"><text>Very funny... Our security is good against monsters. But here — either they didn’t notice them, or didn’t want to notice, or didn’t dare. I locked myself in that little room and didn’t stick my head out. All I heard was some mumbling and movement. And Sakharov’s shouts and his “threats” to call someone.</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_6"><text>So what does Ghost have to do with it? And what did they want?</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_7"><text>Nothing at all! Ghost wasn’t mentioned at all. That’s just the professor imagining things, trying to find someone to blame. I didn’t open the door, heard things vaguely, and didn’t understand everything I heard. I asked Sakharov, but he didn’t understand much either. Long story short, someone told them that we might have special tools here for some kind of special weapon. That’s probably what they were looking for.</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_8"><text>You’re issued special weapons?</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_9"><text>You too?! No, of course not. Sakharov told them the same — that we don’t have anything like that and don’t deal with it at all, that we do biological and... well, completely different research. And they listened to him very attentively, but kept doing their thing. I could hear them moving crates behind the wall. Like the saying goes — “Vaska listens, but keeps eating.” Sakharov went on about “I’ll call, I’ll report!..” They rustled around a bit more and left. Maybe they really took in what Sakharov said, or maybe they realized there was nothing there and no point searching, and backed off.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_101"><text>Hmm... Someone told me about “Monolith weapons.” Could that be the special weapon in question? Supposedly it also requires a whole suitcase of tools. Still, I doubt you could hide that in a desk drawer.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_102"><text>Yeah... Still, it’s interesting what they could have meant. What kind of weapon, what kind of tools? Any ideas?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_111"><text>You listen to all sorts of fairy tales... Although Doctor Perelman once talked about some tools to grab something and place it into a sealed container. But I think he was talking about an artifact. Or maybe he was actually talking about the “Black Mark,” wanted to put it into a container.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_112"><text>Who knows?! Anything’s possible... For example, Doctor Perelman once talked about some tools to grab something and place it into a sealed container. But I think he was talking about an artifact. Or maybe he was actually talking about the “Black Mark,” wanted to put it into a container. </text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_12"><text>Tell me more.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_13"><text>There’s nothing more to tell... That’s how rumors are born and nonsense spreads across the Zone. And then someone filters those stupid rumors and starts a “treasure hunt.”</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_14"><text>Rumors, you say? Uh-huh...</text></string>

<string id="monolit_instruments_second_51"><text>So why are you loitering here? Can’t you see — I’m thinking. Get lost, go chase dogs...</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_52"><text>Some thinker you are...</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_101"><text>Hey, man, what do you want?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_102"><text>Well, one of your guys asked me to bring him a little thing, promised mountains of gold, and then disappeared somewhere.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_103"><text>So he disappeared, big deal. Did you find what he needed?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_104"><text>I... didn’t bring it with me... stashed it for now. I actually wanted to ask him a few things. You haven’t heard that story about a suitcase of tools, have you? And about some Sniper...</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_105"><text>Ah... so he was feeding you that mono-gun crap too? Really got on my nerves with that talk. But if you’re curious, I’ll tell you. Supposedly he met a scientist, and that one started spinning some tale about a super-duper weapon. You can’t just use it, supposedly — you need special tools. And it wasn’t about Sniper at all, but about Strelok himself... well, you get it. People will make up anything.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_106"><text>I see... So the tool belongs to Strelok, huh? Where did you say that scientist was, and what was his name?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_107"><text>Oh come on, you actually bought that? Somewhere in Yantar, I think... Others already came by asking too. But it’s all nonsense.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_108"><text>I’m just asking so I don’t have to listen to that nonsense again... So who was it that came?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_109"><text>You’re really getting on my nerves with the questions! Who, who... A horse in a coat. Took the coat off and left. You drinking? No? Then beat it, stop bothering me.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_110"><text>Alright, calm down... You’ve already got drinking buddies, and I’m not in the mood. Just don’t drink away your coat.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_201"><text>You keep poking around, poking around... No peace.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_202"><text>Peace will be in the grave. And even that’s not guaranteed.</text></string>

<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_0"><text>Hi, Zub. I’ve got some business for you.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_1"><text>People only ever come to me on business, nobody invites me over for tea.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_2"><text>You’ll manage without tea... I know that recently one stalker was planning to sell you some papers concerning the operation of the system for pumping water out of tunnels connecting various facilities deep underground. I need to take a look at a few things in them.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_3"><text>Just like that, straight to the point? No easing into it, no asking how my health is, no telling me how you’re doing, no mentioning how you happen to know who was going to sell me what. Though it’s not hard to guess. Docent tipped you off, right? You don’t have to answer, no need to be Sherlock Holmes here.\nAs for the papers… they’re already gone, used to start a campfire. Don’t worry though, everything interesting was copied and rewritten onto other media.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_4"><text>Who would doubt it. I’d like to get acquainted with that knowledge. Care to bargain?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_5"><text>That depends on what exactly you need. Information comes in all kinds: important, very important, vitally necessary. And the price, naturally, will differ. Be specific about what interests you, and I’ll assess the level of importance. Then we’ll decide whether there’s even any point in bargaining, yeah?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_6"><text>Basically, the topic is this: there’s a flooded tunnel, and there are pumps that can be used to drain it. I want to know exactly where that tunnel is, how to get into it, and how the water can be pumped out.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_7"><text>And that’s all? What about the motive? You expect me to believe you dragged yourself all the way here and are ready to pay out of sheer curiosity? Or are you hinting that Zub’s gotten a bit dull?\nWhere does that little tunnel lead?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_8"><text>I’m saying there’s a commodity, there’s a seller, there’s a buyer — everything else doesn’t matter.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_9"><text>You’d be safe to take on a recon mission, Marked One. Solid as a rock. Not a single extra word slips out, huh? Admirable, on the one hand, but on the other… you could’ve been a bit more forthcoming. In exchange for a discount, for example. Ah well, we’ll see.\nAnyway, come back in about half an hour. I need to check my notes and have a word with a couple of people. So take a walk.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_10"><text>Uh-huh. I’ll be back soon.</text></string>

<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_12"><text>You’re just in time. So, here’s how it is: I’ve got the code for the door to the flooded tunnel you’re so eager to get into. You do know it’s locked with a keypad, right? That’s one. There’s information on where power is supplied to the pumps. That’s two. And I also roughly know the place where they’re switched on. Where do we start?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_2"><text>With the price. Is it approximate too? Or exact?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_3"><text>For the door code — a dummy artifact. For pointing out the power supply location — a couple of dummy artifacts, or we can haggle.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_4"><text>And what do you want for the tip on where to switch on the pumps?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_5"><text>That’s a separate conversation. Artifacts won’t be enough here. But we’ll get to that later.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_6"><text>Got it. Give me a moment, I’ll size up my options so I know what I can bargain with.</text></string>
