<string id="dolg_000"><text>Record: \nWhen meeting up, give this to Sanya Orlov, important. Saturday evening, Marked One was spotted near his quad's stash. Now the little rat is caught...</text></string>

<string id="dolg_001"><text>Record: \nTo the quad: ammo delivery for Cherep's group tomorrow. They asked for more underbarrel grenades. And bring some grub too.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_002"><text>Record: \nShornikov's quad died at the Army Warehouses. Heroically. A fight with Freedomers, and before that mutants mauled them pretty bad. The men didn't make it, and they were good soldiers \nInform Mishka Kovtun's wife. Petrenko should have the address.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_003"><text>Record: \nDon't forget to change the coordinate table for stashes in the Dark Valley. \nThe old one's invalid starting Monday!!! \nInform the quads currently out on raids.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_004"><text>Record: \nSwamps. Mechanical Junk Yard. Roof. Trophies from the fight with Scar's thugs were hidden in the attic. Pick them up during the next raid.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_005"><text>Record: \nDuring the raid to the Swamps, stop by the Swamp Doctor. Show him the leg. This ain't just a Burnt Fuzz. This is some kind of weird crap!</text></string>

<string id="dolg_006"><text>Incoming: \nSeryoga, got an order from the nerds. Three snorks, alive. Deliver to Yantar on Sunday. We taking it?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_006_1"><text>Outgoing: \nWhat's the pay?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_006_2"><text>Incoming: \nArtifacts, what else? When did they ever pay with anything else? Don't know which ones exactly yet, main thing is to decide in principle - are we taking it or not.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_006_3"><text>Outgoing: \nNah, I'm out, I got stuff to do. Give Kozmin a whistle, maybe he'll want it? Anyway, let the stalkers catch 'em. Dealing with live ones is too much hassle.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_006_4"><text>Incoming: \nWell, as you wish.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_007"><text>Incoming: \nTO ALL FACTION MEMBERS!!! \nIn a week it's the General's birthday. \nANNIVERSARY!!! \nOfficers are invited to the celebration. Dress code is full dress (meaning, no rags). \nPrivates and sergeants will be issued an additional ration. \nIn cognac equivalent.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_008"><text>Incoming: \nHi!</text></string>
<string id="dolg_008_1"><text>Outgoing: \nAnd same to you! :)</text></string>
<string id="dolg_008_2"><text>Incoming: \nListen, can we read the nerds' PDAs?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_008_3"><text>Outgoing: \nNah. It's possible, but very labor-intensive. Not profitable.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_008_4"><text>Incoming: \nWoah — not profitable! It's a gold mine. Any expenses will pay off!</text></string>
<string id="dolg_008_5"><text>Outgoing: \nNot necessarily. They might pay off, but only if you know exactly whose you're reading and what else it's gonna cost.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_008_6"><text>Incoming: \nSo what? Grain by grain...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_008_7"><text>Outgoing: \nIn Oldie's quad they once started cracking them, also thought they'd find out all the secrets, but it was just chatter about Electra properties. And then what? Spent a ton of money and learned what we already knew. \nDo you have something specific?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_008_8"><text>Incoming: \nI'm just asking out of curiosity mostly... Though, I got a little something.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_008_9"><text>Outgoing: \nIf we know too much, we won't live to grow old. :) If you have something very specific and profitable — we could try pushing for resources from Papa. But it's unlikely.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_008_10"><text>Incoming: \nHow would I know what's in there? I don't have anything yet, just some ideas that we could get something out of it...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_008_11"><text>Outgoing: \nYou better not make it public. Taking stuff without asking, I bet :)).</text></string>
<string id="dolg_008_12"><text>Incoming: \nI ain't a fool... Alright, bye for now.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_009"><text>Outgoing: \nGood morning! Want a laugh?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_009_1"><text>Incoming: \nYou bet!</text></string>
<string id="dolg_009_2"><text>Outgoing: \nRemember Oleg made a bet with Arni yesterday that he'd make it to Yantar and back in a day?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_009_3"><text>Incoming: \nYeah, he's supposed to be back before noon today. Why?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_009_4"><text>Outgoing: \nHe won't be back. :)</text></string>
<string id="dolg_009_5"><text>Incoming: \nWhat's so funny about that? Is he dead?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_009_6"><text>Outgoing: \nNope, alive and well, he's on the road from the Wild Territory to the Bar right now. Only he won't reach Arni.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_009_7"><text>Incoming: \nWhy? Did he get hammered on vodka at the checkpoint again?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_009_8"><text>Outgoing: \nTwo Vortex anomalies formed right at the passage, side by side. No way around 'em. Unless he bolts through the Warehouses. Or waits until the next blowout.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_009_9"><text>Outgoing: \nSo he's just standing there, cursing his head off. Our guys all gathered on this side and are cracking up. Basically, Oleg's buying the drinks. :)))</text></string>
<string id="dolg_009_10"><text>Incoming: \nWell, that's not fair. If it weren't for the anomalies, he would've won.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_009_11"><text>Outgoing: \nWhy not fair? The deal was — from the Bar to Yantar and back to the Bar within twenty-four hours. Nobody said anything about anomalies. This is the Zone, bro. :)))</text></string>
<string id="dolg_009_12"><text>Incoming: \nYeah, what a riot. Tough luck. :)</text></string>

<string id="dolg_010"><text>Outgoing: \nHey. I found out a little something.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_010_1"><text>Incoming: \nWhat?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_010_2"><text>Outgoing: \nYou forgot? Remember that place where you can't get through the Fruit Punch? Well, some stalker was bragging to me that he knows a way to walk through the Fruit Punch without any trouble. Says they hooked him up with info at Yantar.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_010_3"><text>Incoming: \nWell, and?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_010_4"><text>Outgoing: \nHe's asking 20 thousand for the info.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_010_5"><text>Incoming: \nLook at this guy, huh! Fine, I'll contact the nerds now. Stall him. And notify Petrenko, we'll need to publicly execute this skinflint if it's a lie. Which, by the way, I don't doubt.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_010_6"><text>Outgoing: \nNo problem, I said I'd get the money by tomorrow, you find out in the meantime. Just don't lose sight of this creep so he doesn't slip away. He might've been sent by Freedomers, you never know.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_010_7"><text>Incoming: \nGot it.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_011"><text>Outgoing: \nHey. What do you think about that last mess?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_011_1"><text>Incoming: \nI reckon someone leaked the info ahead of time. You got doubts too? They couldn't have just ended up there like that. Someone definitely sold us out.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_011_2"><text>Outgoing: \nThat's true, but who's the rat. It's not you or me, seemingly. And it can't be Vasilich... So who — Ushastyi or that guy in the new getup? I didn't like him from the start.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_011_3"><text>Incoming: \nThat's not a fact yet. Our own guys could've set us up. Remember last week when we got into it with the second quad while drunk?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_011_4"><text>Outgoing: \nYou nuts? Sure, plenty of talk happens when you're hammered, but to set your own people up like that later... You're stretching it... I'm telling you, it's that guy, what's-his-face, with the funny nickname. Need to lean on him a bit and feel him out...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_011_5"><text>Incoming: \nAlright, let's roll up to him tonight. You, me, and we'll take Vasilich, almost everyone who was there, and have a heart-to-heart.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_011_6"><text>Outgoing: \nLet's do it, before he skips town... Come over.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_012"><text>Outgoing: \nFedyai, did you see the message from the nerds?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_012_1"><text>Incoming: \nWhat kind of nonsense is that?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_012_2"><text>Outgoing: \nWell, the message. Look in the "inbox" folder in the general channel.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_012_3"><text>Incoming: \nAh! I still can't figure out this devil-machine, I barely found the messages from you. Where do I look in this calculator? Anyway, what's the topic?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_012_4"><text>Outgoing: \nThey're looking for their egghead who vanished somewhere near Yantar. Reward and honors for the finders, as usual.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_012_5"><text>Incoming: \nSo what kind of guy is he?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_012_6"><text>Outgoing: \nSome Vasilyev. Haven't heard anything?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_012_7"><text>Incoming: \nSome guy passed by, looking all frantic and ragged. And his suit was that... red one. The kind they always hang around in. It was the day before yesterday, after two PM. Didn't come up to us, just stomped past... or rather he was on autopilot. Had a flask in his hand — mumbling something. I reported to the senior, said it looks like zombified are coming. He chewed me out: "what kind of report is 'looks like' from a lookout". I don't know anything else... And that guy just kept going towards the bunker.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_012_8"><text>Outgoing: \nNah, doesn't seem to be him based on the time...</text></string>

<string id="dolg_013"><text>Incoming: \nTell me, please, what kind of kindergarten is this? Some kind of ideology... These factions. What do you need all this for? You will lose yourself as a scientist by engaging in these follies. I even have a suspicion that this is all the result of some kind of radiation completely blocking a critical perception of the world. Forgive me, but these social associations of yours based on worldview principles are simply ridiculous...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_013_1"><text>Outgoing: \nMy dear Professor, that's not quite right. First and foremost, we set a goal for ourselves to protect the world from the influence and emanations of the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_013_2"><text>Incoming: \nBut colleague, allow me to still call you that for now, these goals have long and successfully been carried out by military organizations. Why meddle in a sphere completely outside your functionality?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_013_3"><text>Outgoing: \nThe military is doing a decent job, but they perform purely security functions, whereas they don't always manage to stop the spread of those notorious artifacts—in fact, they mostly fail. And that's no secret. </text></string>
<string id="dolg_013_4"><text>Incoming: \nI won't argue with you there. The facts, as they say, are plain to see. But why do YOU need this?</text></string> 
<string id="dolg_013_5"><text>Outgoing: \nProfessor, we've discussed this issue with you many times. The influence of artifacts on the human body is practically unstudied, yet they're already being dragged beyond the Perimeter in full force, used there for what people assume are their identified properties. This has been turned into a profitable business, and how or what it'll turn into... they don't want to think about it. So someone has to—as pretentious as it may sound—stand guard over the interests of humanity...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_013_6"><text>Incoming: \nGod, how ridiculous to just throw everything away and join some gang covering up its little deeds with high ideals and loud slogans... And you bought into these slogans. After all, you would be of much greater use doing science...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_013_7"><text>Outgoing: \nWell, here we go again... Excuse me, I have to go.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_014"><text>Outgoing: \nMax, you're a fool.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_014_1"><text>Incoming: \nAnd why's that? Didn't get your hangover cure, or what?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_014_2"><text>Outgoing: \nDo you even realize what you're doing, for heaven's sake? How can you drag this filth out of the Zone, get it through your smoke-filled head! What if some "Slime" (ugh, disgusting, what a name to come up with) goes off tomorrow somewhere in Kyiv so hard it levels half the city? Can you guarantee that won't happen?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_014_3"><text>Incoming: \nDude, you're wrong. Want me to back it up? Look, I got a pal out there, beyond the Perimeter. You know, he named his kid after me. Why? Because his wife was diagnosed with cancer a year ago. They sent her home and gave her a permanent disability status. That's how it's done when there's no chance left. He emailed me about it. I had to seriously bust my hump, of course, and I pushed the boys too, but it was worth it. At least now I know for sure I'm not hanging around here for nothing, because I helped a friend. What options did he have without your "Zone infection," tell me that, dude?</text></string>

<string id="dolg_015"><text>Incoming: \nWord is you found something special, enough to make Sakharkov dance a jig in his bunker for three days straight? Come on, spill it! :)</text></string>
<string id="dolg_015_1"><text>Outgoing: \nWasn't me. Our guys found a notebook somewhere in Yantar. Raggedy as an old sock! Can't even make out what's written there anymore. But I deciphered a few bits and copied 'em to my PDA. Look: \n"...Prevent the possibility of any unauthorized persons entering the Object's area of operation. We must localize the potential consequences of its functioning. The staff has practically lost control of the situation. The Object is affecting the environment, and results are already manifest. The Object has localized within the local complex..."</text></string>
<string id="dolg_015_2"><text>Incoming: \nWhat kind of crap is that?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_015_3"><text>Outgoing: \nYou're the crap! The guys used the notebook for kindling, but Sakharkov promised me a new generation device for these records. Shows all anomalies plain as day. I'll be walking 'round like I'm in a park! I intentionally didn't show him everything yet, said there's plenty more... And if there's not enough, I'll write the rest myself :) Look, check what else was there: \n"...Staff is instructed to take all measures. It is also necessary to prevent access to the Object and, where possible, record all instances of local flora and fauna being exposed to radiation at the breach site. The use of technical means must be commensurate with the degree of danger..."</text></string>
<string id="dolg_015_4"><text>Incoming: \nCool... Is there more?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_015_5"><text>Outgoing: \nYou bet! \n"...I don't understand why there is no connection with the center? We've been here for three weeks now, like on a desert island ...acting like they've gone mad. However, it's been clear for a long time that this was a risky experiment. Heaven knows what's happening..."</text></string>
<string id="dolg_015_6"><text>Incoming: \nYou probably made up all that gibberish yourself and Sakharkov fell for it :)) You should ask him for a mutant-rattle while you're at it, let him give you one. You'll spin it, make some noise, and they'll all run away...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_015_7"><text>Outgoing: \nIf you don't believe me, fine, why'd you even ask then...</text></string>

<string id="dolg_016"><text>Outgoing: \n"Freedomers" are all just stoned idiots. Heard what they pulled this time?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_016_1"><text>Incoming: \nYou talking about the hound?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_016_2"><text>Outgoing: \nYeah. And the main thing is, they put on a show on purpose, like: here you go, Dutyers, suck on this! We'll haul a live pseudohound past and won't even ask you! Straight beyond the Perimeter! And with an escort! Might as well have brought an orchestra...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_016_3"><text>Incoming: \nHow did San Sanych even allow such a thing?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_016_4"><text>Outgoing: \nHow... just like that. Don't you know? They got leaned on from HQ. Some fop arrived for an "exchange of experience." A present for foreign colleagues... Sanych is pissed, yelling at his own men... It's even for the best that the Freedomers were the ones catching the beast, 'cause if the soldiers had taken losses, Sanych would've ripped that fop's throat out, you know him...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_016_5"><text>Incoming: \nI know. That's the only plus. If San Sanych gets removed, such a mess will start here, God forbid...</text></string>

<string id="dolg_017"><text>Incoming: \nSeven to Three. Come in! \nWhat's your status? \nWhy aren't you answering the radio?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_017_1"><text>Outgoing: \nWell, we're done for! Got almost right up to the second building, and there's some kind of crap flying around. Transparent and silent. Slavik got buried under bricks immediately. Along with the radio. Looks like this thing is the one chucking 'em...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_017_2"><text>Incoming: \nThen get the hell out of there! The fifth quad is already on its way to you.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_017_3"><text>Outgoing: \nNo way. The exit's caved in, we're blocked... We fired a volley from the underbarrels, part of the wall collapsed right in the passage, and there's no way around...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_017_4"><text>Incoming: \nIt's alright. Not the first time. We'll dig you out. Just wait for us.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_017_5"><text>Outgoing: \nNot this time, likely... Genka and Sanyok are gone, and my leg's broken... I'm on promedol for now... This thing is hauling itself around somewhere nearby... That's it, I'm toast... Zombified are pouring in...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_017_6"><text>Incoming: \nThree... answer me...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_017_7"><text>Incoming: \nThree... </text></string>
<string id="dolg_017_8"><text>Incoming: \nGod damn it all to hell! Three...</text></string>

<string id="dolg_018"><text>Incoming: \nAntokh, did you see about the gifts for our general? What do you think? Let's give him a flask with an engraving. But what to engrave?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_018_1"><text>Outgoing: \nHeh! How about a wolf's profile and the inscription: "Greetings from the Army Warehouses" :)))</text></string>
<string id="dolg_018_2"><text>Incoming: \n:))) Only you'll be the one presenting it then, he won't shoot you. :))) \nBut seriously?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_018_3"><text>Outgoing: \nOh, quit messing around. The boys already got him something, an SVU with inlays. A beauty. Leshchyov made it, got the gold from Yantar.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_018_4"><text>Incoming: \nAh, alright then. What's on for tomorrow? We wanted to bolt for some "mushrooms" in the morning.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_018_5"><text>Outgoing: \nNothing much, it seems. Go ahead, just leave early and don't stay out too long, just in case.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_018_6"><text>Incoming: \nGot it.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_018_7"><text>Outgoing: \nIn the pocket. Got it.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_019"><text>Incoming: \nSpent two weeks getting treated on the mainland and I don't even recognize the base anymore. Whaddahell happened to the Arena?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_019_1"><text>Outgoing: \nIt's gone to meet its maker. Or rather, the General ordered it so. Said enough is enough with the sweepstakes here.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_019_2"><text>Incoming: \nOh, wow! And what about Arni?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_019_3"><text>Outgoing: \nArni's become a banker now. You can trade in ammo of an unneeded caliber and get the ones you actually want. And further down, Yurko Lisaped set up shop. Fixes weapons. Does a damn good job, I tell ya. And it's cheap.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_019_4"><text>Incoming: \nGot it. Good to know.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_020"><text>Record: \nThose bandits' brains have completely rotted away. Yesterday, a boar attacked one of 'em. The guy's just lazily shooting back. And his two buddies are standing nearby, scratching themselves below the belt. A circus, dammit.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_021"><text>Outgoing: \nHas any of you fine gents cooked these "Electro-Beads"? The recipe I snagged says you need an EH liver. But Semyonov mentioned a kidney, for crying out loud. How'm I supposed to take that? Tried cooking in three different Snow anomalies, and all for nothing. Mind you, my Mama's Beads were already weathered. Maybe I need fresh ones, or maybe it's all about finding the right anomaly. Someone explain, please.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_021_1"><text>Incoming: \nWell, you clearly got played... Either the one who gave you the recipe, or Semyonov, or the Mama's Beads, or the Snowy let you down... Or maybe everyone did it together.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_021_2"><text>Outgoing: \nYou lot just love to grin. And here I am having a tragedy, ya see...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_021_3"><text>Incoming: \nSo just publish the recipe. Maybe we'll all pitch in and help...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_021_4"><text>Outgoing: \nYeah, fat chance! Go to hell, gentlemen! I'll figure it out myself.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_021_5"><text>Incoming: \nAnd you started so well: "fine gents..."</text></string>

<string id="dolg_022"><text>Record: \nIn general, this road leading from the Garbage to the Bar is like one big ravine... And if you look from the side of the transition, its right steep part can serve as a decent cover in some places... Even if a controller spots you, it's enough to just dodge its psi-attacks in time by moving out of sight behind one of the ledges. And a solid argument against a controller is, as always, a grenade.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_023"><text>Outgoing: \nWhere the hell is Petrenko? Ivantsov's been harping for a week that he went to Sakharkov to speculate on artifacts. But he ain't there, I took the trouble and checked myself.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_023_1"><text>Incoming: \nWord is he's at Yantar trying to catch a girl-snork to fulfill his most depraved desires...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_023_2"><text>Incoming: \nOr he's at the Swamp Doctor's, treating the consequences of those desires...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_023_3"><text>Outgoing: \nYou guys think it's funny, but I need him for official business.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_023_4"><text>Incoming: \nI'll give all you jokers a "desire-trimming" right now, even without the Swamp Doctor. And you—stay put. I'll be there in an hour.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_024"><text>Outgoing: \nBy the way, let me ask: does the banker at the Bar still take paper recipes and some other items in exchange for ammo? For one recipe, I got over 20 boxes (~600 rounds) of expensive ammo. No scam here?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_024_1"><text>Incoming: \nIf he's selling for 'em, let him, what's the harm? Maybe he's just real interested in recipes.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_025"><text>Outgoing: \nFound a technique for shooting pseudosnakes: you gotta shoot them in the head when they're standing still and don't see you. Thanks.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_025_1"><text>Incoming: \nCongrats on discovering America...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_025_2"><text>Incoming: \nAnd they always think they know better than the old-timers...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_025_3"><text>Incoming: \nWhere do guys like you come from? Did a blowout give birth to you or something?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_025_4"><text>Incoming: \nAuthor is on fire.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_025_5"><text>Incoming: \nThanks, the method works.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_026"><text>Incoming: \nSuit's trashed again...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_026_1"><text>Outgoing: \nYou just came from the repairman. What happened?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_026_2"><text>Incoming: \nWell, you see, I let my guard down. Went to Sultan's to pick out some new gear. And then—a boar's roar! I practically jumped out of my skin and bolted in a panic. Without looking, I stumbled right into a Fruit Punch. Only later did it click: where the hell would a boar come from on Duty territory?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_026_3"><text>Outgoing: \nYou're something else, you comedian.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_027"><text>Record: \nToday in the Bar one free stalker was bragging, claiming he doesn't use detectors or even bolts anymore. Says he tells anomalies apart by ear. Claims he stopped trusting them after he confused a detector's beep for Fruit Punch with the squeak of a tushkano.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_028"><text>Outgoing: \nMessage from Sakharov. Verbatim: "Colleagues, stalkers! I urge caution — in the presence of large-scale painted metal structures in underground areas, the surface of a Fruit Punch forms a carcinogenic colloidal suspension, inhalation of which leads to irreversible damage to the tracheia arteria."</text></string>
<string id="dolg_028_1"><text>Incoming: \nKume, what's all that about?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_028_2"><text>Incoming: \nSomething about some poison dust in the tunnels... pffft!</text></string>

<string id="dolg_029"><text>Incoming: \nTo quad commanders. When bringing biomaterial to the scientists, weights must be no less than: \nTushkano head - 300 g. \nBoar hoof - 800 g. \nTails (dogs, cats) - 200 g. \nSnork ankle (with foot) - 1 kg. \nThe rest - as it comes. \nPetrenko.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_030"><text>Incoming: \nTo quad commanders. To repair armor, the following metals are required: titanium, molybdenum, chromium, and other rare earths. Leave anomalous and radioactive metals at the checkpoint before the Bar until the expert arrives. Used armor must undergo sanitization. \nGeneral Voronin.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_031"><text>Outgoing: \nSniper Abakan! Has anyone worked with it? Optics are fine. But the 1-2 shot firing (two-round burst). There's gotta be former military here. Explain, why the burst on the Abakan?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_031_1"><text>Incoming: \nActually, the two-round burst on the Abakan — that's its whole thing. Read up on it on weapon sites online. Don't really need to be military for that.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_032"><text>Outgoing: \nBy the way, this Tesla zone is damn unpredictable. The truck at the entrance soars into the air, and everyone nearby dies. Grenades land right where they should, seemingly, but the explosion happens in the sky above the impact point.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_032_1"><text>Incoming: \nIt's the ZONE, bro... The further in you go, the weirder it gets...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_032_2"><text>Outgoing: \nGreat explanation, dammit.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_032_3"><text>Incoming: \nYou threw the grenade — did it kill everyone you aimed at?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_032_4"><text>Outgoing: \nWell, yeah...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_032_5"><text>Incoming: \nSo what the hell are you gripin' about then? You some kind of nerd? If so, go to Yantar and join 'em pickin' flowers. If not, do the job and stop payin' attention to useless crap! Got it?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_032_6"><text>Outgoing: \nGot it.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_033"><text>Incoming: \nTo all quads in Dark Valley. Stalker reports indicate a large pack of pseudodogs. Strong psi-strike. Dark Valley, north of the farm. Area of the large boulder. Investigate and carry out a sweep. General Voronin.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_034"><text>Record: \nMorning: receive rations for the recon quad. Warehouse No. 6. Senior Lieut. Yuryev. Papers are with Khomenko.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_035"><text>Record: \nReplace return spring. Four failures. State in report: combat encounters with "Freedomers" on the 4th, 11th, 13th, and 21st according to dispatches.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_036"><text>Record: \nPatrol trail is not safe! Two anomalies (marker 850 and between markers 1700-1750). Report during the morning briefing.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_037"><text>Record: \nReporting: \nDuring the sweep of the Yantar factory complex, a new variety of mutated specimen was discovered. Species — "zombie." Upon bullet impact, the specimen explodes with damage factors in the form of a shockwave and fragmentation elements. No samples provided due to lack of remains. Explosion effectiveness is comparable to an F-1 grenade. I recommend firing to kill from a distance of no less than 50 meters.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_038"><text>Record: \nIt's just a standard subsonic round. There's no locking of powder gases in the casing or anything like that. That's why there's a suppressor. The suppressor locks the powder gases and, naturally, hides the flash too. The subsonic round itself makes for almost total noise suppression, unlike more powerful rounds. Dig around for info online, there's plenty. However, the shooter gets a very heavy round with a heavy bullet and a very steep ballistic curve. Generally, our army isn't too thrilled with it. Don't know about law enforcement. Haven't seen any reviews.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_039"><text>Incoming: \nFive, what's your status?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_039_1"><text>Outgoing: \nAll good, commander, we got the client, took him quietly. The gang didn't even blink, they're sitting aside dividing the loot.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_039_2"><text>Incoming: \nLosses?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_039_3"><text>Outgoing: \nNo losses, Lokhmatyi's nose is sideways, Bob lost his PDA, no time to look for it, gotta bail before the gang gets spooked.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_039_4"><text>Incoming: \nWhat about Kocherga?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_039_5"><text>Outgoing: \nTried to make some noise, had to quiet him down. Heading to the Base.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_039_6"><text>Incoming: \nWaiting, the room is ready, I think the guest will like it. Do not use the radio.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_040"><text>Letter: \nBlind dogs aren't scary alone, even cowardly; they might attack only if they're very hungry. In a pack they're dangerous, even for larger opponents. Their eternal enemies are boars, burers. And humans, of course. Very often they can be found together with pseudodogs. If you come across such a pack, it's better to give it a wide berth. And it's better to fire single shots and only at the head. It takes 3 to 6 rounds to the body, which equals death, since blind dogs are very fast and often deal psi-strikes. The most effective weapon against them for long-range is an automatic weapon with optics. For close-range, shotguns will do.</text></string>
