<string id="agr_krot_story_0"><text>Got anything to cheer me up?</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_story_1"><text>I got a funny story for ya. So, I am walking back from Dark Valley one evening. It is getting real dark, can't see a damn thing. Only a small campfire flickering in the village way out in the distance. Well, I figure, I'm close to my boys! I am passing some thickets and I spot a silhouette in the bushes, thinking it is another one of those bandits spying on us, waiting to report back to his boss so he can get his pockets stuffed with dough and maybe snag an artifact-powered peashooter. I think to myself: "I'll give him a proper scare! Teach him to poke his nose into someone else's turf!" I creep up behind him, pull off a perfect grapple, and whisper right in his ear: "What the hell you doing here, you animal?" "Grrrrahhh..." comes this sound from the bandit. Figured as much! With my professional grip, I am pressing right on the sweet spot; he can't even twitch, let alone get a word out. But then I smell it, stinks just like a ghoul. Guy must have crapped his pants for real. So, I loosen the grip and say: "You ever show your face here again, you bastard, I'll pull your brains out with these very hands and make you eat them, got it?" And suddenly this "creature" wheezes back: "What's your problem, man? Let me go! Can't a simple bloodsucker take a leak under a bush anymore?!"</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_story_2"><text>Heh-heh, not a bad story, gave me a good laugh...</text></string>

<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story2_0"><text>What else can you tell me?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story2_1"><text>Lord, I have had plenty of adventures, couldn't tell them all... Things happened to me that are scary to even look back on... I was walking through an abandoned tunnel once. Why was I there? Well, think for yourself, some scavengers set up camp near the old station, only a day passed since the last blowout, and I had a couple of kilometers to cover. Checked my map and realized for sure, there's no other way but through that tunnel. There weren't even any tall tales about the place. Maybe a couple of anomalies, that's it... So I am walking, and the silence is just heavy, pressing on me. Can't see the end of the tunnel, just the little circle from my flashlight dancing ahead. Wasted about ten bolts on all sorts of anomalies. Suddenly, I hear water dripping, and then some kind of scraping. I stopped, dropped my rucksack, and listened. Holy cow! That ain't scraping—someone is moaning and groaning about twenty paces ahead. Well, I didn't have any other road, so I pushed on toward the sound with my old Glock. The noise was coming from behind a tilted train car. I got closer, took a look, it's a broad! Honest to God, hair all tangled, looked thirty or forty, lying there in her rags. Muttering something nonsensical. I lowered my Glock, felt kinda ashamed even, figured the lady needs help. And, y'know, it didn't click right away, what's a woman doing in the Zone, let alone in a dark, abandoned tunnel? By the time it hit me, it was almost too late; the damn creature shot her arm out at me! It was an Izlom! Good thing my reflexes are still sharp! I caught a bullet in the forehead and folded without even a twitch... I picked up my rucksack afterward (loot's a damn fine weight to carry!) and I realized... I realized, brother, that the Zone has taken more than one soul. And every time it takes a new one, there's one more monster out there. And it's no coincidence, oh no, that the Zone is playing these jokes. Whoever heard of an Izlom being a woman?! I feel a foul revolution is coming soon...</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story2_2"><text>Come on, you probably just imagined it...</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story2_3"><text>No way, my eyes are sharp as a hawk's, thank God. Mark my words, stalker, something is brewing in the Zone. None of this is for any good...</text></string>

<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_0"><text>Anything new you know? I would be interested to hear it.</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_1"><text>Of course I do! Have you heard about the Cunning Old Man?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_2"><text>What old man?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_3"><text>The Cunning one. I have not seen him myself, but Petrukha, a buddy of mine, told me about him. He went out for some loot once. He wandered into the dead forest and got lost. Got stuck in the middle of nowhere, anomalies everywhere, and it was already starting to get dark. He did not know how to get out. He was crawling through the bushes and suddenly he hears voices. Well, Petrukha went toward the sound and sees a couple of bandits. He thought: I will follow them, maybe they will lead me to the road. But they did not go far. They came out to a small clearing, and there was a bearded old man with a stick, sitting on a stump. The bandits went straight to the old man, and Petrukha stayed in the bushes and watched. The old man said, "Stalkers, got any smokes?" The bandits saw that there was nothing to take from the old man and started cursing at him: "What the hell are you sitting here for, you old geezer? Tell us how to get to the road, or we will gut you right now." Well, the old man explained to them, like, go between those trees, then right, and so on. The bandits went, and Petrukha was about to follow. Just as he got out of the bushes, he hears: "A-a-ah Boom! A-a-ah Bang!" It became clear that the bandits had walked right into an anomaly...</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_4"><text>Serves them right, the bastards!</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_5"><text>And the cunning old man had already noticed Petrukha and asks for a smoke. Well, Petrukha gave the old man a cigarette, he lit it and says: "Stalker, do you have anything to eat?" Petrukha opened the last can of stew for the old man, thinking: "Let the damn guy eat, as long as he shows me the way." The old man finished the stew and says: "My throat is a bit scratchy, you probably have something to drink in your rucksack too?" Nothing else to do. Petrukha took out a bottle of soda, almost full. The old man took it, downed it all at once, and says: "That is a nice jacket you have, warm, probably?" Petrukha thinks—since I started playing charity, I will have to keep it up. The cunning old man put on Petrukha's jacket and says: "It is late already, you should go home or you will catch a cold. Go over there, between the bushes, you will see a large dry tree, then right along the ravine, and you will find a path." Petrukha went, thinking: "Well, if there are anomalies there too, I will..." He looked back, and the old man was already gone, as if he had vanished silently. Well, Petrukha pushed on in the specified direction. Soon the dry tree could be seen from afar. He gets closer and sees: there are tons of artifacts lying around, even a few Absolutes. He loaded up on loot to the brim, did not even pick up all the cheap artifacts. Anyway, he reached the camp by morning. He made a ton of dough for the loot and spent a week drinking with his buddies afterward. Petrukha went back to the forest later, looking for that place, but never found it... Or maybe he is just lying...</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story2_6"><text>Your buddy is full of it! What kind of partisan old man is this? Although, maybe there is some truth to it. I will have to ask the veterans...</text></string>

<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story_0"><text>You look like a veteran to me. I bet you have seen a lot in your time.</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story_1"><text>Yeah, more than enough. Sometimes you see things that make you feel like you are losing your mind. Take this for instance. My partner and I had been eyeing a certain Research Institute for a long time. The place was eerily deserted. No animals around, no mutants. But whoever went there either came back scared to death and completely out of their head, or they were never seen again. We decided to scout it out ourselves, quietly. We headed out before dawn, and by the time we reached the place, the sun was starting to come up. We left the car in a small ravine and went through the forest to the edge of the clearing. We stopped there; my partner stayed down below, and I climbed a tree with my optics to see what was happening in the area. I see the buildings, they did not look completely abandoned, almost all the windows were intact, and there was not much grass in the yards, not like in other places where it is waist-high... Everything suggested people lived there, yet there was total silence and no movement. Then suddenly, just to the right, bursts of fire rang out, someone was firing an assault rifle in short bursts. I trained my sights there. I see a man on the roof of one of the buildings, scurrying around like a trapped rat, shooting blindly in all directions. At what, I looked, and I could not understand, he was alone up there. And then... it started... I saw everything as clear as day. The rifle just flew out of his hands on its own... Like the piece of iron grew wings!..</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story_2"><text>Hard to believe!</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story_3"><text>Do not be ironic. The guy opened his mouth, clearly yelling something, pulled out a knife and held it out in front of him. And then, holy mother of god! I see another knife hanging in the air right in front of him. Just hanging there in the air with the blade pointed at him, and nobody holding it. What happened next is not a story for the night... They spent five minutes cutting that man. Bit by bit, the bastards—damn them to hell—a cut here, a stab there... The poor soul was soon covered in blood... Then, as his legs started to give out, his own knife was knocked away too; then the man is lifted into the air and twisted around a couple of times... I have never seen anything like it in my life—literally, he was being wrung out like a rag... I was soaked in sweat in three seconds... Then... No, that is it, I will not say more... Anyway, once I caught my breath, I spent another five minutes scanning the surroundings with my scope. My hands were shaking, the lens was wet from sweat... But not a single creature to be found! Not in the normal spectrum, not in infrared, nothing. When I climbed down, my partner took one look at me and decided not to ask. When we got back to the base, I stayed drunk out of my mind for a week, never sobered up... Later, when I recovered a bit, I asked our guys, maybe someone heard of such a thing? But people just started looking at me sideways, wondering if I had gone crazy. So, that is how it was...</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_visitors_14_story_4"><text>So what kind of thing bit that guy? It is like that sometimes—you walk through the Zone, thinking you have studied it inside and out, spotting every anomaly from a kilometer away, and then some unknown crap sends you to the next world... It is almost insulting...</text></string>

<string id="bar_arena_man_story_0"><text>What is the word in the bar? Telling tall tales, are we?</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_story_1"><text>I heard an incredible story there tonight. It is hard to believe, to be honest. It was told by a veteran named Gray. Who he is and where he came from, nobody knows, as Gray appeared here among the first. It is as if he has always been here. It always amazed me how someone in his condition could head out into the Zone, and even return from there with something in his hands. A mystery... But let's get to the point! I caught his monologue toward the middle; at first, I did not pay it much mind, thinking it was just typical drunken rambling, but the man was saying such amazing things that I soon forgot about everything else.</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_story_2"><text>And what kind of lies was he spinning?</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_story_3"><text>"...anyway. I pushed the door, it opened again. I take a step. Locked again. So I, like, open the bitch, and the bitch just closes by herself! I realized that someone was not letting me in through the door. Well then, I climbed in through the window. Inside I caught my breath, fixed myself up a bit, and went to see who was playing around with the door. And there is this big room, and a table is standing in it, long like a highway. And by the table is a chair, tall like a TV tower. And then someone started whispering in my head, there was even an echo! 'Who are you?' it asks. I say: 'I am Gray, I am a local, every dog around here knows me.' Then the whispering started again: 'You, Gray, why are you poking around the Zone, why did you climb through the window?' But I did not lose my head, I say: 'Well, I just came in for a drink of water, saw there was nobody, so I climbed in.' 'Ah, water... There is no water for you here, Gray. Besides, you do not need it anymore.' 'No water? Well, then I am leaving?' Then I tried to bolt out of there fast. It was all the same to me whether some local creature had started talking to me or if it was the delirium tremens, but it was time to get out of the Zone. 'Wait, Gray, stay, I have business with you,' it started whispering again, and my feet grew into the floor, could not move them. 'Something is wrong with your head, I can hardly feel you.' 'Why is that,' I ask, 'should I be felt? There is no need to feel me.' 'That is the point, there is a need,' the whisper says. 'I can sense people like you from two hundred meters, but I only sensed you right in front of the door, and even then, only after you started breaking in. Do you have some new special equipment?'"</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_story_4"><text>And what did Gray do?</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_story_5"><text>"'What kind of equipment? I do not have anything. Just a flashlight and an old double-barrel, that is all my equipment. I have never had anything like in my life, officer.' 'Do not lie to me, Gray, I can see right through you, do not tempt fate.' 'I swear to God, I do not have it! Well, search me if you want!' 'And that we can do,' it whispered again. Then my jacket started moving, everything in my pockets started crawling out on its own. And most importantly, my precious flask was going too! Well, I think, you bastards, I will not give you my DEAR property! It is a whole day's walk to my shack, I will not survive without it! I clutched that bottle like it was my own child: 'This is mine, citizen officer!' But it was like someone was holding the bottle! And they would not let go, pulling it upward. Well, I think, you bastards, you will not see my moonshine! I pulled the bottle to me, pulled the cork out with my teeth, and started drinking. I barely managed three gulps. It would not go down! My throat was squeezed like a vice, I had circles before my eyes. Well, anyway, I forced down another five gulps, threw the bottle at them: 'Choke on it, you bastards!' That is when it let me go. 'Where did you go, Gray?' it started whispering again... 'Where did you disappear to?' 'I did not disappear anywhere, citizen officer,' I say, while I am crawling away slowly. 'Do not be a fool, Gray, if I catch you—it will be worse!' That is when I realized, even though the moonshine had hit my brain pretty good, the creature had lost sight of me, I had to run! I somehow got to my feet, everything is shaking like a nine-point earthquake. I walk up to the window, look back: nails are flying in the room, my things from my pockets, bricks are falling from above. And that cursed whisper behind me: 'I will get you anyway, Gray, I will get you, I will get you...' I jumped out of the window and ran! My things, my gun—everything stayed there! How I got out of the Zone drunk, God only knows. Íî now—not a foot in there! I would rather die than go back! I think I will go to the scientists instead, they have been asking me to be a watchman for a long time. My gun, my jacket—all my things are goooone... Bas..." Then Gray fell asleep. Right in the middle of a word. And I thought: a delusion is a delusion, but it has long been noticed that even though a drunk has no place in the Zone, the Zone still does not touch the drunks, it lets them out. Does it find them disgusting or what?</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_story_6"><text>Maybe... But who was it that attacked Gray, huh? Does not sound like a controller...</text></string>

<string id="bar_dolg_petrenko_story_0"><text>Greetings, Commander, how is the service going?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_petrenko_story_1"><text>It is fine, Marked One. Have you heard about the new monster?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_petrenko_story_2"><text>Nope.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_petrenko_story_3"><text>Well, a friend of mine told me this story. The higher-ups woke him up in the middle of the night to run to the lab, some cargo has arrived. He is half-asleep, not understanding: what cargo? They tell him: "Did you drink too much of the state alcohol or what? There is a fresh corpse on the table, dinner is served!" He goes to the table. And there is... well... He has seen plenty of dead bodies from the Zone in his time: torn apart, roasted, boiled, and dozens of mutants, but this time his dinner started doing laps in his stomach. Basically, at first glance, it was almost a human, except the head did not look normal at all: a huge, lumpy pumpkin. And the body was like something from a concentration camp, just skin and bones. But he figured that out later; at first, he says, I look and it is just a mess: everything inside out, smeared with orange-red filth, like blood... Those idiots did not spare the ammo. It was, he says, a cross between a colander and a torn hot water bottle... And they clearly walked all over it in their combat boots; it was not an object, but a chunk of meat in black rags.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_petrenko_story_4"><text>Yeah... not a very pleasant sight...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_petrenko_story_5"><text>Anyway, he slaved away for the rest of the night and half the morning. It turns out it is the same creature the locals know as the illusionist: black rags, visions for the stalkers, a head a meter wide... The funny thing is what people thought was its face. Whoever saw it thought the face was the crown of the head. No, he actually has a face, it is just very tiny: the eyes do not open and the nose is like a pin, though the maw is massive, like a barn door. It probably walks with its head hanging on its chest, no strength to keep it straight... A real egghead... And imagine what these things eat for lunch. Mushrooms! Little mushrooms! Everyone has seen them, the Zone is full of mushrooms, and the old-timers swear these things squeeze the juice out of them. Gourmets... And do you know what was hidden in the pouch at its side? Well? You will never guess! It had dried brains in there. And do you know whose? Controller brains!</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_petrenko_story_6"><text>Hmm...</text></string>

<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_story_0"><text>Hello, sergeant, how is the daily grind?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_story_1"><text>Lousy, every day it is either an ambush or a sweep... We were setting up an ambush for bandits recently, decided to hole up in a hangar, and then this happened, we stumbled upon a new monster. So we are getting into that hangar. Dust everywhere, cobwebs all the way to the roof, detectors are spitting out complete nonsense, saying not only that there is no one around, but that we do not even exist. We went to take positions along the perimeter: Sanyok in front, we are covering... And then CLANG! Those big rusty beams under the ceiling, one of them breaks loose and comes down! How Sanyok dodged it, he does not know himself, but that thing slammed right into the exact spot where he was standing. Well, once he fell and rolled away, he did not get up at all, just started blasting from the ground! The rest got scared too, idiots, and started firing into thin air. Then Sanyok started yelling something about a creature in the corner. I look, I do not see any creature... Anyway, it turned into a mess, not an operation, just a total disaster... a madhouse...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_story_2"><text>Go on.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_story_3"><text>We started walking through those ruins; we walked for about five minutes, very carefully, so as not to end up under those beams again. And it was nonsense, just complete nonsense: first one guy, then another would see something, and they would spray half a magazine into empty space. Two guys were really unlucky: one was walking on a level floor and suddenly fell into a pit, and the second got hit across the back by a door that flew off its hinges. Well, then we really got worked up, it was clear some creature was having fun! We switched on the psy-protection, tossed a gas grenade into every corner—and we are waiting to see who shows up, fingers on the triggers. We wait and wait... And the creature, as it turned out later, was flying or something... While we were all playing the fool down below, it was quietly sitting under the ceiling and enjoying itself. We only realized it too late, and even then, almost by accident. The beast loosened a few more beams—half the roof collapsed, right on top of us, crushed four of our guys on the spot... That is when we got it!</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_story_4"><text>You don't say!</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_story_5"><text>As soon as Sanyok heard a rustle above, he instinctively fired a burst, a very useful reflex! And then, what a shriek! We jumped up too, of course, and let it have it with every shot... The creature tumbled down from above with screams so loud they made your ears ring. Well, then we took our revenge: some hit it with rifle butts, some just kicked it, and Sanyok even pulled out a knife to make it hurt more when he gutted it... The commander, obviously, had a hard time dragging everyone off, otherwise we would have had to scrape that bastard off the floor with spoons...</text></string>

<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story_0"><text>Hello, how is life?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story_1"><text>I went to the edge of the Zone with a buddy recently, and a funny thing happened. It went like this. We are approaching the boundary of the Zone. I take out my wire cutters ahead of time and head toward the barbed wire fence. Then Vasil looks at me all sly and says: "Bet I can make a hole in the fence in seven moves." I catch on right away and answer: "Well, I can do it in six!" "And I can do it in five!" "Four!" Then he says: "One!" Whoa, I think to myself, no way—how is he going to pull that off? Well, I say, go ahead then! And this nutjob calmly takes a grenade off his belt and plops it right under the fence!</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story_2"><text>What, really?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story_3"><text>Yeah! I only had time to yell: "Don't!" before I slammed face-first into the mud. "It has to be done, Fedya, it has to be done!" Vasil said and plopped down right next to me. Ka-boom! We got covered in a good amount of dirt and mud. And a sign that said "DO NOT approach! DANGER!" shrieked through the air over our heads and buried itself in the mud somewhere behind us. I grab Vasil by the belt: "Run! The devils from the checkpoints will be all over this place in ten minutes!" And we bolted through the giant hole in the fence, then across the field to the nearest grove. Once we got there, we hid in a convenient little pit, catching our breath while listening to machinegun fire shredding the trees above us. All sorts of debris, wood chips, and pinecones were falling on us. That is when I say to Vasil: "Bet I can punch you in the face on the first try?" Heh, so that was the funny episode we had.</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_hunter_story_4"><text>Yeah, that's funny, gave me a smile...</text></string>

<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story2_0"><text>Listen, how do you make some money in the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story2_1"><text>Talking big and having cash are two very different things... what, you think the money comes for free here? Hell no! For free, you only get eaten by some freak or gunned down by soldiers... You have to think. You have to think out there, and even more so back here. The brainless thugs do not last long. It does not work if you have nothing in the attic... Anyway, here is how it went. Three of us, me, the late Sinyak, and the late Tsepa, were walking through a farmyard, cutting across the road. We see a bandit walking along. Well, we hid. He passes right by us, does not notice a thing. He was a small guy, but he was lugging a bag that was massive. And his rifle was hanging in a clever way, one wrong move and he would pepper us with lead. So, Sinyak is like, "Let's shake this egghead down and see what he has..." And I tell him: "Quiet, you woodpecker! Better to watch where he is taking his loot." Well... then the sucker just disappeared somewhere, we did not even understand what happened. So we wait. About twenty minutes later he climbed out. While he was standing there brushing himself off, Tsepa quietly snuck up behind him and took half his head off with a pistol. He and Sinyak started gutting the body: he had some high-class armor on, and surely a fat wallet... I stepped away to take a leak, my boys always give me my cut, I am always in on the deal. Then, out of nowhere, BOOM!.. Turns out that victim was not so simple: he had rigged something clever so it would blow up if anyone tried to take his armor off.</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story2_2"><text>A clever bastard, that one.</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story2_3"><text>Yeah. I got out of there fast, never know who might show up after a shot and an explosion... I came back a month later. Not a single bone left of Tsepa, Sinyak, or the sucker. Absolutely nothing. Anyway, I figured out where he had ducked into the ruins and went in myself... Well, I went through three room, nothing! Then I see a pile of beds heaped in a corner. Why the hell were there so many beds there? Anyway, I started clearing them out. I finished, and mother of god, a hatch! I lift the cover and shine my flashlight. Holy crap! I am in heaven!.. Well, what was down there is my business... I did not come out behind. If I had just sat around listening to others, I would have been a corpse long ago or I would still be running around barefoot, talking trash... Like some people...</text></string>

<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_0"><text>What happened? You look like you just came back from a funeral.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_1"><text>Yeah, I fell for someone, you know, like a schoolboy. I met this girl, I could not believe my eyes. You would think there are plenty of pretty girls out there, right? But this one was... she was... perfect. Yes, that's it, perfect. I had this feeling that the world around her was black and white and blurry, and she was the only thing in color and sharp focus. The way she moved! I have never seen anything like it before. I literally got a lump in my throat. Why did she have to care about science so much! What is she doing here in the Zone?.. Well, yes, in the Zone. It was toward evening... There is a separate nine-story building near the bus station. First, something flashed in a window on the first floor. I quickly took the safety off my Kalashnikov, and then I see someone walking out of the entrance... I wanted to rub my eyes, you never know what to expect from the Zone. But she walks up. And I am standing there like an idiot, staring... I keep my rifle ready though, force of habit...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_2"><text>Yeah, really, we have become completely hardened out here...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_3"><text>Then she noticed me... Smiled... Said hello... And I am listening but not hearing a thing, just looking at her. She was in a blue jumpsuit, real bright... But not baggy, almost form-fitting... Her figure was something fantastic! Then it finally hit me that I was not listening at all to what she was saying, just standing there with a grin from ear to ear... Turns out she was from a research group. She asked if I could help her. Help her! I would have crawled into an anomaly for her!.. She said she was studying these, what do you call them... Endemics of the Zone. You know, plants that are only found here. She said she ran away from her guards because there is no freedom of action with them, and she came here alone. I do not know. I believed her. I agreed to help bring her something. Two days later I came back as agreed. I almost got wiped out five times while I was collecting the stuff. I am walking back and I have only one thought in my head: I am about to see her again! And nothing. I did not even see the house where I met her. Just like that... But man, how beautiful she was! It was like she was glowing from the inside...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_4"><text>And did you see her after that?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_5"><text>No, I never saw her again, and two months have passed since then... It is scary to even think that something might have happened to her...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_6"><text>Well... For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo... Don't you grieve, brother, you will forget it soon enough...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_base_guard_story_7"><text>No, brother, things like that are never forgotten...</text></string>

<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_0"><text>Can you tell me something for free?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_1"><text>Alright, Marked One, I will tell you about a man who made it all the way to the Sarcophagus.</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_2"><text>Alright, tell me.</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_3"><text>Recently, I was walking through the Warehouses and I see a person. He was covered in mud and leaves, and his clothes were an old jacket, probably an old anti-radiation suit. I approached him and saw that he did not seem to have any wounds, just a mad look in his eyes; they were wandering as if looking at someone behind me. I ask him what he lost here and what happened. With trembling lips, he begs for something to drink and eat. "Show some respect to a veteran one last time," he said. Well, I am not a beast, so I let him take a sip from my flask and gave him some bread and sausage. I started a fire in the hollow and put two cans of stew on the flame, since this old man said the conversation would be very long. Well, I did not seem to be in a hurry, so I listened. This man's name was Efim, and he was 43 years old. He entered the Zone among the very first, explored it inside and out, dragged out a ton of artifacts, but that is not the interesting part. Something else is. One day, he decided to break through past the Radar into Pripyat.</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_4"><text>And? Seriously? How?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_5"><text>Hold on, let me speak. The way he went is impassable now, as the tunnel that connected the Radar and Pripyat was buried during one of the blowouts. At this point, I suspected he was lying, but then he began to tell things that would be simply difficult to make up. The tunnel ended in one of the supply stations in Pripyat. A huge room filled with spoiled, gnawed, and sour food, rusty ammo, and so on. After leaving the hangar, the old man almost stepped into an anomaly. He described it exactly: "In the center, silver threads sparkle like a cobweb, with tiny bubbles on it, just like some kind of dew... And behind the web... Darkness. The whole world seems to be shrinking into this darkness..." Under the anomaly, everything seemed to be pulled together, twisted... torn... a sort of brownish-gray dust hung around, flesh and blood suspended in timelessness. The old man got terrified. He threw a bolt into the anomaly. The bolt flew normally at first, but then...</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_6"><text>What happened then?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_7"><text>The bolt suddenly bent, twisted, the thread straightened out and curled in the other direction, and then... the bolt crumbled into pieces, which were ground into dust, becoming finer and finer the further they moved toward the center. Slower and slower... until it hung on the threshold of non-existence... Swallowing hard, the stalker bypassed the strange... anomaly and quietly moved further, throwing bolts ahead of him. In one of the houses, he stumbled upon a poltergeist lair, which he had to clear out with an underbarrel launcher. He spent the night in the vacated dwelling. And in the morning, he saw another surprise of the Zone. Efim came out onto the square in the city of Pripyat. Lenin himself loomed on a pedestal. But the color was rusty for some reason, and the statue was covered in what looked like hair. Well, research interest forced him to throw a bolt. The bolt had a very bad time. Touching the hair on the monument, it rusted and oxidized in an instant; only rusty dust fell onto the asphalt. And in Pripyat, the dawn was burning out...</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_8"><text>You speak beautifully! What next?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_9"><text>The sun rose into a strange, murky sky, unaware that such a vile place as the Zone exists. Passing the entrance to the Chernobyl NPP, Efim, or as you already realized, the Guide saw The Sarcophagus. It turned gray against the sky, strangely blurred behind this giant with a roof like a sieve. And then... The sky turned gray... more... even more... black dots flickered before his eyes, the whole world decomposed into two colors, black and gray... The Geiger counter showed frantic activity, lightning flared out of nowhere... And then the blowout struck. It seemed as if it was not the Sarcophagus that exploded, or anything else, but rather his own head, from the inside, turning into a squirming lump of gnawing pain. New anomalies exploded nearby—different kinds, acidic, gravitational, electrical, poplar fluff was flying, but he did not notice it; his legs carried him further away from this terrible place on their own, while someone screamed in his head and a strange noise was heard somewhere.</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_10"><text>So what happened to him?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_11"><text>It seemed to the Guide that his brains had simply been squeezed out, as if he had been hit with a current of a myriad volts... As if a crowd of people was screaming right in his cerebellum, shouting something meaningful but fading behind a veil of pain... Luckily for him, the man fell into a Portal anomaly; it simply transported him somewhere to the Radar from there. I mentally checked the facts, there was a blowout yesterday, not a particularly strong one, so maybe the man is not lying. At this point, the Guide choked on his own blood. It was a strange color, lilac. The Zone, the Zone... what are you doing... what are you? Or maybe, who are you, and not what?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_12"><text>Did he die?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_13"><text>Yes, he just dissolved like jelly. A gruesome sight, better not go look at it.</text></string>
<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_story_14"><text>Alright, thanks. You should be writing memoirs about the Zone.</text></string>

<string id="gar_seriy_story_0"><text>What is new?</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_1"><text>I found a rare artifact yesterday, listen to how it happened. I am walking somewhere around the Army Warehouses, through a small village. Habitually throwing bolts, checking the detector, and smoking a cigarette. Suddenly I see that the bolt I just threw does not want to fall to the ground. It is just hanging there in the air. Well, I was floored. I have been roaming the Zone for a year, but I have never seen anything like that! From the cultural shock, I guess, my mind went a bit foggy... Anyway, I stuck my hand in there...</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_2"><text>How did it feel?</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_3"><text>Like I stuck my hand into thick jelly... And you cannot pull it out of there fast for the life of you! So I am just standing there with my hand out, like I am begging for alms in the middle of the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_4"><text>So how did you get out?</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_5"><text>Anyway, that is the best part! There, about 30 centimeters from my hand, some strange thing was lying—a kind of spiral with little blue droplets on it. And it glows so strangely... As if it is emitting something... I started reaching for it with all my strength... Reached and reached... I stood there for half an hour.</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_6"><text>The bloodsuckers were probably watching you like they were at the movies.</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_7"><text>Maybe. And the controller was collecting tickets...</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_8"><text>So what happened next?</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_9"><text>Nothing. I grabbed the thing, and everything stopped at once. No more jelly. But now, if anything happens, I have my own portable Matrix.</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_10"><text>That is for sure. And what did you name the artifact?</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_11"><text>Well, I already knew about this artifact. The Barman told me, he just didn't mention the anomaly... The artifact is called Mama's Beads.</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story_12"><text>Cool.</text></string>
	
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_0"><text>Sigh... Man, I am so bored.</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_1"><text>Bored? Well, listen up and stay sharp. A real strange thing happened to me. I was walking through an abandoned village one day. I have been there many times... You have probably been there too, everyone passes through it. It was getting late. I see light in the windows of one of the houses. I got curious about who was holed up in there and decided to take a look. And the house... it looked alright, like it was not abandoned at all. I peeked through the window; did not see anyone, but it felt weird. Well, I decided to go in. I step inside and I am floored. Everything is clean and tidy. Furniture everywhere looks brand new, flowers on the windowsills, and there is even a rug on the floor. I am lost in guesses, thinking maybe the old owners came back or something? I go into another room, and there is a table set: plates, all kinds of food, and even a decanter with something clear in it. Well, I am no fool. I figure the owners must be nearby. Maybe they stepped out to answer nature's call or something. I stood there, waited for a bit. But I am starving, and that soup smelled incredibly good.</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_2"><text>There is no way.</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_3"><text>I had already started forgetting what food like that smells like. I figure, why let the food get cold for nothing. I will have a little snack, maybe the owners won't be too offended. Besides, I have enough to pay them if it comes to that. I sat down in a chair, a real soft one. Slid the shotgun under the table and started eating. I ate well, and the vodka in the decanter turned out to be good, not some cheap moonshine. Anyway, I am sitting there, enjoying myself. And somehow I drifted off, fell asleep basically. I wake up—it is already light out. I looked around... Hell! I am sitting in the middle of some filthy shack on a wooden crate. I quickly grabbed my bag—loot, weapons... Everything is there. I am floored again, where am I? I went outside, looked around. It seemed to be the same house, but all shabby and crooked. It had become a regular house, like all the others. I stood there, thought about it—I did not smoke anything weird yesterday, so it was strange. I kept going. What do you think causes hallucinations like that?</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_4"><text>You should drink less.</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_5"><text>No way! I hardly ever drink, I do not mess with any of that junk, I lead a healthy lifestyle, so why would that happen?</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_story_6"><text>Hmm... I do not know, it is all the Zone, brother, probably messing with our heads. I have these strange dreams about the Chernobyl NPP myself, and a feeling like I have actually been there... It is all very strange.</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story2_0"><text>Have you heard about the Wish Granter?</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story2_1"><text>Of course! Did the Barman tell you all sorts of fairy tales about it too? I almost found it once.</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story2_2"><text>You are lying!</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story2_3"><text>Let a bloodsucker drag me away if I am lying! Honest to God! Listen. It all started at the Garbage. I was hiding in a scrap metal pile from Pyotr the Stingy—you know it is impossible to work with that bastard... Always shouting: "That is mine, I saw it first!" Starts shooting in all directions... So anyway. While I was hiding, I had a bit too much moonshine, gotta protect yourself from the radiation somehow, and then I got lost and ended up in a swamp, brother... I would have drowned there, but thanks to Red Husher who saved me. When we were heading back, he told me that Butcher found the Wish Granter... And that he knows the way; he offered for me to go with him, saying you need two people—one cannot make it through there alone. Well, I was overjoyed! I was about to reach the Wish Granter and I forgot to ask about the path, like an idiot. Then, right before the checkpoint, some creatures attacked us. I bolted for the post because I had lost all my gear in the swamp, and Red started heading back toward the swamp while returning fire... I never saw him again, and he never had the chance to tell me the way, which is a shame... So that is the story.</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story2_4"><text>You are still lying, Gray.</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_story2_5"><text>Oh, get lost...</text></string>

<string id="escape_tutorial_wounded_story_0"><text>What is making you look so spooked?</text></string>
<string id="escape_tutorial_wounded_story_1"><text>I still cannot recover from what happened recently. Listen to this. I was heading toward the Garbage one time, and it had already gotten dark. Well, I was also pretty drunk. I think to myself, what is the point of wandering around here at night? I will end up in an anomaly while wasted or the dogs will catch my scent. I figured I needed to settle down for the night somewhere. I looked around and spotted an abandoned house. I crept up, everything seemed quiet. I went inside and lit a match. I see a ladder to the attic. Well, I climbed up. There was a hole in the roof and the moon was already shining through. I see some bags lying in the corner, some rags, junk basically. I lay down on that pile, close to the hole in the roof. I figured if anyone walks near the house, I will hear them. I put my Kalashnikov somewhere close, shoved the rucksack with my loot under my head, and fell asleep immediately. Now, I am a light sleeper. Suddenly, I wake up. It is dark, only the moon is shining right through the hole in the roof. And I hear these strange sounds coming from behind my back. Like some kind of grunting or gurgling. I carefully turn my head and look over my shoulder. And there, right behind my back, a bloodsucker has made itself comfortable. The bastard is curled up, and it looks like it is sleeping too. I broke into a cold sweat. I am lying there, afraid to even move.</text></string>
<string id="escape_tutorial_wounded_story_11"><text>What makes you say that? Everything is fine...</text></string>
<string id="escape_tutorial_wounded_story_2"><text>Well, go on.</text></string>
<string id="escape_tutorial_wounded_story_3"><text>I am wondering how it snuck up unnoticed and why it did not attack me. But I have to do something. My weapon is somewhere nearby, but I am afraid of waking the beast. By the time I grope for the rifle and rack the slide, the bastard will have time to rip my throat out. I am lying there, thinking, while my breath is completely hitched. And then I noticed that I had the rucksack strap in my hand. And the rucksack under my head is heavy—artifacts in there, stew, all sorts of ammo. So, I carefully looped the strap over the bloodsucker's head and immediately hurled the rucksack through the hole with all my might. I jumped to the side, and the bloodsucker got caught by the neck and dragged headfirst into the hole right after the rucksack. In its half-asleep state, it did not understand a thing; it started screaming, flailing its arms and legs, and got stuck right there in that hole in the roof. I do not know which of us was more terrified, but I ran without looking back until I was out of breath. Later it hit me that I was the one who climbed into the bloodsucker's lair and just did not notice it in the dark.</text></string>
<string id="escape_tutorial_wounded_story_4"><text>Oh, I cannot take it! Ha-ha! You are something else... Spending the night in a bloodsucker's lair!</text></string>
<string id="escape_tutorial_wounded_story_5"><text>You think it is funny, but I really miss my rucksack.</text></string>

<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_0"><text>Hello, how is life?</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_1"><text>Not bad, taking it slow. Something happened to me recently, want to hear about it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_2"><text>Sure, go ahead.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_3"><text>I am returning from Lake Yantar with some loot the other day. It was evening, almost dark. And there is silence everywhere. I do not know about others, but it is exactly when the Zone is silent that I start feeling fearful and uneasy. I am walking along a path, climbing the slope toward the highway. I had walked here a couple of times before. There are few anomalies here, and on the highway there are none at all, I was not even throwing nuts, bolts, or other junk under my feet. So I am walking, and along the road there are only bushes and trees. Then I hear something from a distance; not that it was very far, but the terrain is open and voices echo over long distances, so it was hard to tell. Anyway, I take out a bolt and toss it into the bushes. Everything seems clear. I make my way through those very bushes and about 400-500 meters away from me, near one of the swamps, I see a figure. And there is some kind of light in his hand. Clearly an artifact. But he was not shouting from joy. Something was moving toward him from that swamp—another figure. Hunched over, arms stretched forward, reaching for the stalker. And then another one crawls out of the swamp after the first.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_4"><text>Just what we needed, swamp monsters.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_5"><text>The stalker started moving, reached to take off his rifle, reloaded, but only managed to fire a couple of shots. Those creatures just kept coming and coming at him. They surrounded him, and he disappeared among them. My hand reached for my own rifle automatically, but I realized nothing could be done anymore. I got up and bolted out of there, since the darkness had already shrouded everything around. The next day I find out that a stalker named Anton, nicknamed Claw, had gone missing. He went to Lake Yantar and never returned. They say he was a veteran stalker. That is what greed does to a person. And yet he knew it was very dangerous to go there.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story_6"><text>Hmm... Thanks for the story. Next time I go to Yantar, I will be more careful.</text></string>

<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story_0"><text>Give me some advice.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story_1"><text>Advice, you say? Alright, let me tell you an educational story. We had this one fool join us for a trip deep into the Zone... We are trekking along, we stop for five minutes to catch our breath, and he immediately plops down on his backside and relaxes. And when it is time to move, he is the last one to get his butt off the ground. Well, he relaxed a bit too much... He fell behind, a controller took over his brain, and that was that... So, remember the moral of the story. A rustle or a suspicious breeze... even if it is just a bunny running past, though God help you with the bunnies here... In short, you have to be ready every single second. Keep your magazines and grenades close at hand and your rifle on full auto. If you see something, unload half a magazine immediately. If there is something behind the bushes, blast it and ask questions later. The basic training here is like this: they will not give you extra duty, they will eat you guts and all before you can even blink! Oh, and about the controllers, that is a separate story. Suppose you fired at a rustle; drop to the ground instantly, that very second! On your back, or however you can. A controller catches you if he sees you; he needs to concentrate or something. While you are lying there in the shade, keep both ears open—listen for rustling or if some piece of crap is walking toward you. You can quietly rack the slide and it would not hurt to have grenades ready too... Anyway, if everything is quiet, count to three and run! Run as far away as possible! Well, did you soak that in? Sigh... Watch your own back every second! That is the only way to survive here...</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story_2"><text>Thanks for the advice!</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story_3"><text>You owe me a bottle of beer...</text></string>

<string id="mil_max_dialog_story2_0"><text>What's the news?</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story2_1"><text>Not much, just sitting here by the fire, telling tales. Not long ago, a stalker stopped by our fire and told us a story. He was wandering through the Zone one day, exploring, and stumbled into some unfamiliar caches. He sees something like a small cave. Could be a bunker, could be just a tunnel... There is plenty of that in the Zone. Well, he went inside. It was dark, but you could see okay for a few meters ahead, though he turned on his flashlight anyway. Suddenly, he spots it in the distance—a controller. Well, it was clear that it was too late to run back; the controller had already spotted him, his thoughts were racing. So he decided on the standard move—charge at the controller at full speed and open fire. He started running, raised his Kalashnikov... Click—a misfire. He racked the slide, click—misfire... And the controller was clearly working his magic at full power... Our stalker keeps running... He racks it again—misfire, one more time—misfire... It was only later he realized those were the controller's tricks... He made it all the way to point-blank range, but the rifle would not fire, so he just swung the Kalashnikov like a club and bashed the controller over the head. That is how he took him down! The stalker said there was plenty of vodka there... said the controller turned out to be a drunk.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story2_2"><text>He is lying, controllers do not like vodka.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_story2_3"><text>Maybe it is not all true, but that stalker was selling vodka at a good price for a long time after that.</text></string>

<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_0"><text>Hello, Skinflint!</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_1"><text>Hello, rookie...</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_2"><text>What are you talking about, man?! What rookie? I have been here a long time, I have seen things you haven't even dreamed of!</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_3"><text>A long time, you say... And did you pass the veteran's exam?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_4"><text>What exam?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_5"><text>So you did not pass it... I see. Well, listen then—there is a test, an initiation ritual into becoming a veteran, so to speak. Pass it, and everyone will respect you immediately.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_6"><text>Really? What kind of test?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_7"><text>Now, this must be done at night, it is not an easy task, you need complete concentration and composure, because the slightest mistake and that is it, you are done for. So, at night, without any weapons, you sneak up very close to a sleeping boar. Then you take a swing and give the boar a kick under the backside with all your might. Then you close your eyes, count to ten, and try to run away. If you make it back to the base alive—consider yourself a veteran. Well, rookie, do you want to become a veteran?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_8"><text>Yes, I do... But do I have to take this test? Is there no other way?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_9"><text>It has to be done, Fedya, it has to be done—everyone went through it. Otherwise, not a single veteran will partner up with you, and traders will overcharge you. There is no other way—that is the custom.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_10"><text>Alright... I am ready.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_11"><text>Excellent! So tonight then, right? Now, I saw a herd of boars not far from the Barrier. And their alpha male is a total monster! Huge, fierce, red eyes, tusks a meter long, if he hooks you, it is going to hurt. I think he is perfect for the test... So tonight, without weapons, and you, you know, kick him, kick him as hard as you can. Got it? Watch out, man, do not get caught sleeping there... Do you have any loved ones? If anything happens, leave a note, I will pass it on.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_12"><text>No thanks, that is not necessary. Well, I am going... So, without weapons, right? Fine, tonight we will see if I can handle it or not. Bye...</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_13"><text>Wait!</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_14"><text>What else?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_15"><text>Dude, did you actually believe that?!</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_16"><text>Well, yeah.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_17"><text>I... I just... Oh, I cannot take it! Ha-ha! Dude, I am just messing with you, oh man... And you believed it?! Ha-ha, you are something else, what a prank! A kick to a boar's backside... Oh, hold me! I will tell this by the fire tonight, they will not believe it!</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_18"><text>Very funny...</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_story2_19"><text>Come on, do not be offended! Let an old man have a joke... Well, see you later, "veteran."</text></string>

<string id="escape_fox_story_0"><text>Listen, Fox, tell me a tale or something, it is getting kind of boring....</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_story_1"><text>Alright, I had a little adventure here... This was before dinner... I had just passed the military outpost. The soldiers have gotten completely bold lately. They let you through, sure, but they rip you off for a lot of money. I was returning with some loot, so I did not want to start a conflict; I just paid up. But hunger is a bitch and would not wait until I reached the village. I wanted to eat so bad that I sat down under the nearest tree and started taking provisions out of my rucksack. To be honest, there was a bottle of vodka too... So, I laid all this beauty out on a newspaper, admiring the landscape, crows flying about, the sun shining... I opened a can of stew and saw some rookies walking in a group about 200-300 meters away. Well, I put the stew aside and grabbed my sawed-off. I figured I would get a bit closer. They seemed to be coming from the direction of the Garbage. It looked like they found a hole in the fence and bypassed the checkpoint... Clever bastards, I think, I will show you! I took out my binoculars, thinking maybe they were ours. But no, the rotten scavengers. Bandits. My god, I think, they are heading for the village! And it is almost evening... So, they want to use the element of surprise. And I only have a sawed-off. I cannot outrun them to the village, and they have already moved quite a distance away from me. Well, I figured, it is my turn to die. I thought at least I would go out like a real stalker.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_story_2"><text>Go on...</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_story_3"><text>And then I remembered. I have a grenade in my rucksack! I generally do not like those things; you take it in your hand and you feel it—someone's death right there, and if you do not throw it in time, it will be yours. But what can you do, the situation was serious... I took it out, dropped my rucksack on the grass, and ran after the scavengers. Their backs were turned to me, and I was wearing sneakers, so they did not hear me. Anyway, hiding behind trees and bushes, I got within about ten meters of them. I can hear them talking. And those scavengers, completely stupid, were walking in a bunch... Well, I think, you are not going to live. I pulled the pin and threw it almost into the middle of the pack! Believe it or not, I took out five with the grenade, and two were left. One of them, terrified, blasted at me with his sawed-off but only hit his own buddy. Well, I did not miss my chance. While he was reloading his sawed-off, I silenced him with this very knife. Now, I am no Indian, obviously, but I can throw a knife from two meters... Don't believe me? Let's go. If I hit th-a-at tree over there, you owe me a bottle. But seriously, brother, tactics are a great power. If I had gone at them with just the sawed-off, imagine...</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_story_4"><text>It would not have gone well for you with just a sawed-off... But a grenade, yeah, that is a useful thing...</text></string>

<string id="escape_lager_volk_story_0"><text>It is boring here on the Cordon... tell me a story or something, will you?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story_1"><text>I just remembered a story... I went to Sidorovich once, and he says some foreigner is coming... Needs a guide, says I should take him to some places, show him an anomaly, that kind of stuff. And I am walking around practically naked—no ammo for my Kalashnikov, sawed-off broke ages ago, only a pistol left, and even then, the rounds are all blanks... Damn, but a man has to eat. Anyway, I agreed to haul the foreigner around the Zone. Well, just near the village, of course. He arrived. Wearing dark glasses, carrying a camera. Gibbering something in his American language and smiling, the bastard. Like he came for a safari. Well, let's go, I say. We did not go far, our guys had recently cleared the territory up to the mill, right from the village. We are walking, the foreigner is smiling, adjusting his hat, clicking away with his point-and-shoot camera.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story_2"><text>Heh, quite a tourist...</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story_3"><text>We reached a small hangar, you know, the one where Fedya the Constructor bit it. Quiet, I tell the foreigner, we are going in for zombies now. He got into it immediately, eyes wide as saucers, and the damn tourist pulls a Magnum out of his rucksack. Holy crap, I think! Who did I take on my own head... No, I say, hide the gun. I managed to talk him out of it with gestures and told him to follow me. And it is dark... can't see a thing. So we are walking, water is dripping somewhere, the glass is rattling in the wind. This tourist is shaking all over. And then, out of the darkness, a "zombie" in camouflage just bursts out at us. I was about to yell at the foreigner to bolt, but I look, and he is already long gone. Right then, the "zombie" and I couldn't hold it in, we just started roaring with laughter! Petrovich really spooked the client... overdid it, even. I wanted to fire a couple of blanks at Petrovich just for show... didn't get the chance! The tourist must have heard about the zombified ones, and when he heard the howl and saw this guy coming at us with arms outstretched... Anyway, we made a tidy profit.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story_4"><text>My god, you guys are something... Ha-ha! Haven't laughed like that in a long time!</text></string>

<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_0"><text>Hello, what is interesting around here?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_1"><text>Something happened to me recently. So, I am walking through the Garbage, minding my own business, and I see a distinctive dent in the ground, just like a Mosquito Bald Spot. To be safe, I throw a bolt and I am floored! The bolt flies right through and absolutely nothing happens! Well, I think to myself, it's a glitch, I must have drunk too much moonshine while roaming the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_2"><text>You definitely drank too much.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_3"><text>No way, listen... Visually, everything was there, you know? You're an experienced stalker, it looked exactly like a Mosquito Bald Spot! The soil was lighter, flattened at the edges, and the pebbles were pressed in. Even the breeze was pulling toward the center.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_4"><text>Sounds like a Bald Spot, you can't mistake it for anything else.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_5"><text>So anyway, I crouched down, took a stone from the ground, and tossed it into the Bald Spot with a high arc.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_6"><text>Did it get torn into dust?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_7"><text>Yeah, I wish I'd seen that. No, the pebble just fell quietly onto the ground, like there wasn't any anomaly there at all. It fell, and that was it. I broke into a sweat immediately. My gut was telling me this was a special case! I started crawling toward the bald on all fours, tossing pebbles as I went, force of habit, damn it.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_8"><text>Well, don't keep a stalker in suspense.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_9"><text>I crawled right up to it, believe it or not. I was soaked like a rat in my suit. The pebbles I’d been tossing were lying right inside the bald. My stalker instinct says: "Get the hell out of here!" But I didn't. A special case! I had to figure it out.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_10"><text>If you'd really crawled that close, you wouldn't be sitting here with us now.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_11"><text>But here I am. So, I put my gun on my knees, scared shitless, and I reach my hand into the Mosquito Bald Spot to grab one of the pebbles! I took it. It was just a pebble, plain and simple.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_12"><text>Yeah right Fanatic, like I believe you. Come on, spill it, what did you find?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_13"><text>Well, next thing I know, I'm being thrown five meters away from the bald. Shouldn't have touched that pebble. The bald activated, the bitch. While I was still in the air, I saw the other stones get shredded into dust. I hit the ground and blacked out.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_14"><text>Pah, you were definitely loaded on moonshine.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_15"><text>Yeah, right! Here, look at this pebble then!</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story_16"><text>Well, I'll be, it really is a stone... I can hardly believe it... M-da-a-ah... But that curiosity of yours is going to get you killed one day, for sure.</text></string>

<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story2_0"><text>What do you think about the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story2_1"><text>Here is what I think... well, not even think—just a hunch... What if everything, all of this, is some kind of experiment on people? Maybe it's some little green men... Why not? It's as good a theory as any... I wonder: if this is a testing ground, what exactly are they testing? Checking which artifacts make us drool the most? Or maybe these things are actually bombs, huh? They've been scattered all over the world, taken into all sorts of labs, with rich guys paying a fortune for them. No, wait, that would be great!.. I’d enjoy that part!.. They buy some piece of junk. Fork over a mountain of cash... Like, "we have the coolest toys," be jealous, you sheep, and then... then it just goes BOOM!.. Oh, man, that's priceless!.. I can't even... whew... But honestly, who knows what’s really going on. Only those who went past the Radar could tell us anything... But yeah, maybe they do know, they just can't say it, they just groan and drool. Maybe that's exactly why they're drooling... Sigh, it’s not a happy thought at all...</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story2_2"><text>Yeah, not happy at all... How about a drink, brother?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_fanat_story2_3"><text>Let's do it, otherwise these thoughts keep crawling into my head...</text></string>

<string id="escape_fox_story2_0"><text>What happened to you? What were those creatures we fought off?</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_story2_1"><text>Mutants... Blind dogs, only white... They are strange. I was shooting at them, but they didn't give a damn... Their pain threshold must be incredibly low. I was coming from the Garbage, from my brother Gray, and this pack started tailing me near the woods. I’m walking, the forest is dark, you can't see anything between the trees. Suddenly something white flashed out and latched onto my stomach... I didn't even feel the pain at first. I shot the mutt and lured half the pack into a Springboard anomaly. I made it here and picked off a couple more... Then I look down and see a literal sea of blood on the floor... When I leaned over, a piece of my armor fell out of the wound and the blood just started gushing... Man, those dogs have some teeth... Imagine, I’ve heard stories about Chimeras, they say their teeth are even sharper and they can jump... Damn, I would have kicked the bucket without you, brother, thank you!</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_story2_2"><text>Don't mention it, Fox, glad to help a comrade.</text></string>

<string id="escape_lager_volk_story2_0"><text>What's the situation with monsters around here?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story2_1"><text>You know, there's been some excessive boar activity nearby, so be careful. If you run into one of those beasts, don't sweat it, just dodge the first charge, it's not hard, then spin around and put a burst into its back. One less pig in the world. But if there’s more than one, that tactic might not fly. Anyway, I’ve warned you; I'm off to Sidorovich to sell some trinkets...</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_story2_2"><text>Understood, thanks for the tip.</text></string>
