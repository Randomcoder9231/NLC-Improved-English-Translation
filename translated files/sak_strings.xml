<string id="tex_mil_lukash_find_dinamit"><text>The Freedom faction leader needs dynamite. According to him, there will be serious problems with the military, who are planning to assault their base and destroy their camp. He believes dynamite should be available from the scientists at the bunker.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_0"><text>Greetings, stalker. What exactly do you need?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_1"><text>We need it badly. There's an old military bunker here in the complex, but it's abandoned. Word is there are new weapons inside. Recently, military patrol squads have appeared who know how to use these systems, and they want to reach our base, probably through the rear entrance. As you can understand, it's crucial for us to find a new route. We've located an underground passage - a tunnel. The problem is we need to break through collapsed areas and clear dangerous obstacles that are blocking our underground construction. I need a controlled explosion with sufficient power, which requires dynamite. That's the situation. I heard the scientists have explosive materials and can help with this kind of equipment. But how do we contact them and arrange delivery? We should discuss this when you have time.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_21"><text>Good, please get us that dynamite.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_22"><text>Well, try asking someone else and come back later - I have many other things to deal with.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_3"><text>Understand, stalker, I'm counting on your help.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_dinamit_have_0"><text>Leader, I have it...</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_have_1"><text>Really? How did you get it?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_have_21"><text>Yes. Here, take it. Carefully... it's heavy.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_have_22"><text>Great, but we still need more. This is exactly what we need.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_have_3"><text>Ah, thanks. Here's your payment for this task, as we discussed. Later, when I finish this job and clear the passage, we can discuss other matters. And here are some supplies.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_have_4"><text>Thanks, you helped us.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_0"><text>We need explosives.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_1"><text>Someone told me - what do you need?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_2"><text>Yes, we discussed this. Someone mentioned that I could get explosives from you. Is this true or not?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_3"><text>Hmm... Here comes trouble! Yes, I have some. But you need much more... very expensive!</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_4"><text>What can we do? Listen, it's true, we need it very much. What would you accept in payment?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_51"><text>Well... I have some. If I were you, as you understand, I wouldn't ask... You need to understand certain basic things. This is extremely dangerous. I'll tell you the conditions: whoever brings an artifact from here, I'll consider - maybe they can be trusted. Or, if I know and trust the person, I can provide dynamite. This is serious business. Of course, there's the matter that I might have various artifacts, different kinds. But maybe you and I can work something out. Understood?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_611"><text>Ok! I know how they work in practice! Excellent.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_612"><text>What exactly do you mean? I don't know...</text></string>

This is extremely dangerous business. I'll tell you the conditions: whoever brings something of value from here, I'll consider it seriously - maybe they can be trusted to handle this. Or, if I know and trust the person well, I can provide dynamite. This is serious business. I should mention that I might have various artifacts, different types. But maybe you and I can work something out. Understood?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_631"><text>OK! I know how they work in practice! Here.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_632"><text>What specifically do you mean? I don't know...</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_7"><text>Good! Listen, whichever one you're interested in, take it with you... So, what do you need right now, stalker? Just don't get confused, comrade - this is serious business, and you need to know what you're dealing with for sure. Come back later, we'll talk.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_0"><text>I need explosives...</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_11"><text>Understood! Bring some artifacts, then I can make explosives available to you.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_611"><text>Yes, I know about artifacts and their practical uses. Here.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_612"><text>Really? OK, alright... Understood.</text></string>

<string id="tex_sakharov_rf_way_article"><text>\nScientist Sakharov, located in the bunker near Yantar, requests that you bring him a radioactive artifact with dangerous properties, specifically a "Stone Flower" class artifact. In return, he will help you find an alternate route to reach your destination through underground passages.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_start_dlg_0"><text>I need help finding an alternate route and path through these areas...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_start_dlg_1"><text>Yes, I have such information. However, as you can understand from my situation, this is not free. I'm currently conducting scientific research on radiation levels and need assistance studying anomalous phenomena. Bring me a 3rd class artifact, and I'll tell you the route. But remember: the artifact must be radioactively charged. This is called, in our terminology, "Stone Flower". If you bring an artifact of this class, I'll help you with the information.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_start_dlg_2"><text>Alright then, I'll try to find one.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_0"><text>I found a route and I'm back here.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_1"><text>You brought the artifact? Excellent, excellent... What do you want from me?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_21"><text>Which route exactly?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_22"><text>Your payment is not enough. Understand?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_23"><text>You didn't bring the required payment.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_3"><text>Yes... thank you, stalker.\nListen carefully, pay attention... Look at the map - here, on the northern side of the factory complex, there's an underground entrance that leads straight to the main underground tunnel system. Understood?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_4"><text>Yes, thank you, scientist!</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_51"><text>Listen, there is one additional way to get to this location via Yantar, avoiding military patrols. But I must warn you that it's not completely safe. Hmm... I have information about some underground facilities and secret laboratory complexes, since my colleagues conducted research there previously.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_52"><text>However I don't recommend going there without special equipment. Very dangerous place.\nIf everything is still working there, then I have a proposal. There are many valuable items there - computers, weapons, and equipment we never managed to retrieve. If you decide to go there, be extremely careful. Use protection... Listen well, this is very important. I once was in similar conditions, so I know what you can expect there.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_61"><text>I still thank you! Maybe you could help me with something else?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_62"><text>Dangerous? Listen, artifacts - you need artifacts... What I'm saying is that the military has valuable equipment. There was an opportunity to study unique phenomena. But now there are problems... And we've lost contact with our people.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_71"><text>I have one proposal for you, if you're interested. If you can secure that underground tunnel system, there are many valuable items there - computers, weapons, and equipment we never managed to retrieve. If you decide to go there, be extremely careful. Use protection... Listen well, this is very important. I was once in similar conditions, so I know what you can expect there. However, I don't recommend going there without special equipment. Very dangerous place.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_72"><text>Do you know about "Agroprom"? There's a safe path straight to that location. According to our data, there are working elevators there. You need to find the main entrance and navigate through the "Red Forest", and from there you can access underground tunnel systems.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_821"><text>Perfect, I know about the "Underground", which can be accessed from that location. See you later, stalker!</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_822"><text>Exactly! I also know of alternate paths leading to "Agroprom"... That should solve your problem.</text></string>
<string id="tex_yan_scientist_find_case"><text>\nA scientist conducted experiments with artifacts near Yantar. Find his abandoned laboratory and examine the equipment.</text></string>

<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_0"><text>Hello?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_11"><text>Yes, I can help you. Here, let me check your equipment and weapons for defects. If I find problems or need to replace worn parts, that costs extra. What can I do for you?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_12"><text>No problems, right? We'll work it out.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_13"><text>I'm curious what method you use to maintain your equipment in such good condition. Good work, and I don't even charge much.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_14"><text>I'm not even wondering what you did with that "Moonlight" artifact. Got drunk? Good work, and I don't even charge much.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_211"><text>Well, stalker, I was just messing around with this thing... Want to barter?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_212"><text>What we should discuss is money, but I'm busy with repairs...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_213"><text>Now I need nothing more. Well, just concentrate on the business.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_22"><text>Alright, alright, no worries.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_23"><text>M-m-m, no money, still...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_24"><text>M-m-m, no money while working...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_311"><text>Agreed. Still we need cooperation in further development. Good money?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_312"><text>Yes, so what? My work's expensive in reality... Labor costs money - understand, and I'm not cheap.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_313"><text>Hmm. What we should know here. Very scary, if you think about it. We never know exactly what kind of equipment, what modifications come from these modern technological improvements. Many stalkers complain about these modern weapon systems in the Zone. Listen, you know, we experienced this strange situation, but now it's clear why it was so strange.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_314"><text>How so... Something - I don't know, what is this dangerous equipment?! Damn! Materials cost money, but should payment be expensive? Well, you know, I understand you won't pay. Too many similar requests - better be patient.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_32"><text>No problems. What do you need... Well, here you can buy things at market price. But if you really need high quality service, then you need everything properly maintained. You should understand this.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_4111"><text>Well... I understand, of course, but I'm disappointed. Goodbye.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_4112"><text>Well, I'm actually reasonable. And we work under normal conditions.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_412"><text>Understand. And we'll somehow work it out.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_413"><text>And future cooperation - will there be any? Understood, thanks.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_414"><text>Well, who knows...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_421"><text>Listen, listen... Alright, I think you're right. Understood.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_422"><text>Repairs, repairs? Eh, well you don't always need them...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_5"><text>All understood. Listen, you come here often, right? When it's ready, I believe you'll return.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_6"><text>Cooperation.</text></string>

<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_0"><text>How are things in business? Working?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_1"><text>Hmm... Did I miss something important? What's wrong? I'm the expert here. Everything is working fine.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_21"><text>Why are you back? I've been recently working on a contract, took some parts for one customer, but I'm still working on it...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_22"><text>Why are you back? I've been recently working on a contract, took your payment, understood. Let's go...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_31"><text>Excellent, buddy. I have everything working here. Work continues, business goes well.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_32"><text>"Business always comes first." What's the point of keeping old stuff?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_41"><text>Good, friend. Alright, excellent.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_42"><text>I understand.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_411"><text>Listen, I don't know what you have planned for the near future. Here's the deal, friend - if you want improvements, you should specifically look to the scientists or at least somewhere else.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_412"><text>Listen, I don't even know what you should take along on the road, and what will be upgraded later somehow. Here's what I think - if you need improvements, you should specifically contact the scientists or at least somewhere else.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_413"><text>Alright, friend, did you get good stuff? Scientists should help with the equipment...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_5"><text>Thanks, that's excellent. I understand.</text></string>

<string id="ways_info_way105a_text"><text>Trading between stalkers and military in the area. Apparently, someone didn't pay their debts. Now we have military presence. Bottom line - not good.</text></string>

<string id="ways_info_way113a_text"><text>If you go north, stalker advised, underground path to base "Cordon", but it's not safe.

<string id="ways_info_way114a_text"><text>Strange situation in place appeared on border between locations.

<string id="ways_info_way158a_text"><text>Underground stalker, but reported several times about areas, how traveled to Agroprom. In this information was especially useful, but recommendations about underground passages above there are dangerous. But all this something about military presence on location.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way159a_text"><text>Underground installation very serious - laboratory complex technical support. In underground complex was infrastructure, trying to save everything they could manage. But now there is no one left in Agroprom, already evacuated.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way162a_text"><text>There is exit from Cordon and there was passage recently. Who at Yantar can travel or stalkers to surface, but someone said by radio or telephone, that means, the exit exists and there is infrastructure in central area itself.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way163a_text"><text>From base "Monolith" you can travel to surface or, as they still call complex, Chernobyl area. This requires careful planning in Cordon area, but you can reach center and not get stuck, if, of course, you can handle this kind of danger. Listen, in that area there are no surface passages, if you have alternative road, while possible.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way164a_text"><text>Yes, that from base "Monolith" you can connect and travel underground, if and through dangerous areas, very electromagnetic. But all this complex should be serious. Something here happens in central complex and this some kind of secret installation. Here stalker situation, but all evacuated and they might have just left area... And maybe, what I don't understand, is happening something?</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way165a_text"><text>I had questions about the surface infrastructure at the "Monolith" base. What kind of infrastructure remains intact on the surface level? "Monolith" should be a serious installation where professionals need to operate carefully - everything there is extremely dangerous, and it's the center of the Zone. I recommend that any stalker should proceed with extreme caution...</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way166a_text"><text>In the military district, there are simple passages from Cordon. If they exist, you can probably use these routes - they should lead straight through the center and then directly to Pripyat. And maybe they still have someone who can help you get through - some kind of checkpoint guard, I suppose, though it should be fairly straightforward with them...</text></string>

<string id="ways_info_way177a_text"><text>From Cordon you can travel straight to Agroprom. The military might just grant passage, though it's somewhat unpredictable.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way178a_text"><text>You've heard mentions of some facilities called "Dark Valley". Possibly, someone from those installations is still active in the Zone, and the military might just grant access. Maybe there's still something useful to be found there... What I'm trying to say is - they were probably just stationed there, then everyone evacuated from the center, if they managed to get out at all? And then, there's probably the idea that maybe some stalker, maybe someone in the center, could provide certain "classified" items or information... and so, well, one starts to wonder about these things. There's something there. If you think about it... maybe there's still something at the center... maybe these facilities can provide access to the very heart of the Zone? Someone should know, or there's some secret to it.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way181b_text"><text>Near Cordon there's a passage that leads towards the route to Pripyat. Military checkpoints are scattered throughout Cordon, but the question is how to properly utilize the main passages. And here they exist as complex routes.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way183a_text"><text>The military forces from the Duty base at Agroprom have established a complex route to Cordon. It's difficult with the underground construction, but the military primarily conducts operations through the same construction passage to Cordon, which can be found near the center.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way184a_text"><text>The central areas can be reached through very complex underground locations. Here, in my opinion, they might be able to establish new passages. And if they can't get more than halfway from Cordon, they should try to secure alternative routes, whether through military construction or other means - but right now they can't establish proper construction access or procurement. And meanwhile they might be able to secure several new passages in this area...\nThe military forces believe that there might be potential in these locations for establishing new access routes...</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way186a_text"><text>Underground, the underground complexes X-6 and X-8 might provide a complex new route. I don't understand what... What they're dealing with in this complex situation - maybe it's just military protocol. And there's a lot to obtain, if they can't manage it, maybe they just can't, or maybe someone has some simple solution.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way199a_text"><text>I understand that they have a route from their location. They simply don't use the road that goes through the new area.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way300a_text"><text>The military said they can establish a new underground connection through the center from Cordon.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way301a_text"><text>They told me that through the center it's straightforward, and the military can provide access at the main acquisition point.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way302a_text"><text>The doctor from Yantar said that they have a simple road that goes through the military "Monolith" facility.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way303a_text"><text>Doctor from Yantar told about the path to Dark Valley.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way304a_text"><text>There's an underground exit from Agroprom that leads straight to the center.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way305a_text"><text>You can get to the center through the underground passages. From there you can reach the surface via a safe path, avoiding the most dangerous spots in the upper complex.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way306a_text"><text>From the abandoned complex to Agroprom you can get straight to the center, and from there to the 'Wild Territory'.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way307a_text"><text>The scientist at the underground facility said he knows how to get to the center.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way187a_text"><text>They found a convenient spot where you can build a route to the bunker of the underground 'Agropromnauchissledovanie' facility to the west.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_862_dialog_3"><text>Well, you know. It's difficult work, dangerous business, if you know what I mean. Still, it's necessary work, I understand. Not many people do this... It requires special equipment.

<string id="artmod_111_dialog_1"><text>Recently I found some valuable artifacts. I don't understand much about them, but someone told me I could get good money for another one. The 'buyer' can 'pay' handsomely, you understand? But it's still dangerous work - very dangerous. What I have here, if anything happens, I'll lose it and someone will take it away. I know the business. And after all that, I still don't know where to find another one like this - that's the problem. If someone brings me quality artifacts, I'll give them good equipment or money in return, so they know there's profit in it.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_111_dialog_2"><text>Wait a moment! Let me see how much this might be worth.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_111_dialog_4"><text>Here, stalker, like this. Done.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_121_dialog_2"><text>Help with what? What kind of help?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_121_dialog_3"><text>Well, what do you think I know? You see, I know that we can work together, but it's dangerous business... Recently I was dealing with some serious stuff. It was tough work, and I made good money from it. And I'm still investigating, looking for clues so that everything goes smoothly. I figure if you're interested in making some real money, you might want to help. But there's something I need from you. How much can you pay in advance? Maybe, depending on what... whether you'll go along with it. And if I don't trust you enough, then even if you're not completely hopeless, I might find someone else to work with.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_122_dialog_7"><text>Nothing too interesting... Well, maybe even if I don't get rich from this, it's still worth something. I think: who cares how much and what it costs - that's not so important. You see, there are no problems... Take some money, you've earned it.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_142_dialog_21"><text>Very nicely done, how satisfying.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_142_dialog_22"><text>Oh! Excellent, I'm truly grateful.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_142_dialog_3"><text>Perfect... Thank you. Now I can go home in peace and sleep well.
Very good, stalker - maybe if I still need something.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_142_dialog_4"><text>Thanks, what's next?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_142_dialog_5"><text>Listen carefully. Very urgent! I have serious intelligence - in Dark Valley there's an underground laboratory. There, scientists were conducting experiments, but something went wrong. It appears that all these years they've been working on weapons and military technology. Do you understand what's there - huh?
If you find nothing you need, then just move on.</text></string>
<string id="tex_esc_bridge_vodka"><text>\nThis stalker may be able to provide information about safe passage through bandit territory. For this service he wants you to bring him quality vodka.</text></string>

<string id="fox_medkit_start_dialog_0"><text>What, looking for medical supplies?</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_start_dialog_1"><text>Yes, as expected... Medical supplies are hard to come by, but I still have some connections. Quality medical supplies - that's power. Serious medical supplies are hard to find, and they're worth their weight in gold.
If you're interested, then I have plenty of different valuable items. Or if you prefer, different medical supplies.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_start_dialog_21"><text>Excellent medical supplies.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_start_dialog_22"><text>Alright, here, this is what you need - first aid kit.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_start_dialog_3"><text>Thanks, buddy. Good luck.</text></string>

<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_0"><text>Here, I brought this, as agreed, 10 bandages.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_1"><text>Oh! How fast you got them. Here's a little bonus.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_21"><text>Great, excellent.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_22"><text>What if I don't? Exactly, what then...</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_3"><text>Thanks for the help! I heard you managed to get "Dark Valley" equipment from the "Barrier". And here, I have some "tea" for you. What do you think? If you're up for it, then I don't mind sharing, if you have some free time ahead. Now actually, I went to the control room in the bunker, and I still have good connections there for serious business, so you can get decent equipment. So I suggest we work together more often, because if you need money - I can get you good profitable jobs.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_41"><text>Let's go deal, and I'll get the "tea" for you myself right now.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_42"><text>Not bad, very interesting. Let's go with an artifact.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_43"><text>You won't regret doing business with me, because what I give you will definitely benefit you, if necessary.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_51"><text>And I don't want any more medical supplies.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_52"><text>And I'm not interested. An artifact, that's better.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_53"><text>Perfect. You did everything right. I was heading to the bunker's control room, of course, on serious business, but here I ran into these guys on the way - took them out!
After that, I realized this is our time in the Zone. Figured out that you're in the Zone, that you're useful for serious work. Realized that I need to work with you more. So what do you think about us working together more often from now on?</text></string>
<string id="tex_esc_fox_medkit"><text>\nIf you help Fox heal up, he'll pay you 10 rubles.</text></string>

<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_0"><text>What are you looking for in the military camp? What did you find?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_1"><text>I understand - I'm an officer and I know very well that submachine guns are necessary. Here you need fast firing rate to bring down mutants or bandits. The weapon worked well - accurate, and the sighting system is outstanding... how should I put it? Yes, I like it. But if you want to trade for this submachine gun, then I don't know. So what do you think - maybe we can make a deal? I'm interested.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_2"><text>You understand how hard it is to get my hands on military equipment?! Or do I not understand something...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_3"><text>Nothing happened to me. Here, as you can see, excellent condition, I have well-maintained equipment. It was used out there for just a short time and barely fired. Maybe later, yes, but for now it's too early.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_4"><text>So what are you thinking. Let's go.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_5"><text>I know after such preparations, you need to pay for this work. And ammunition costs... it's quite expensive, yes, but it's worth something.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_51"><text>I'm thinking, stalker? Alright... but I won't give anything away.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_52"><text>Yes, that's it - exactly what we need. Good, I have something for you.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_6"><text>No problem, I have something for you as compensation.</text></string>
<string id="tex_gar_dram_novice_mp5_m1"><text>\nYurik, whom you met earlier, needs you to find a reliable submachine gun.\nIn his words, any stalker in this dangerous area needs proper weapons for protection.</text></string>

<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_0"><text>I hope you brought it, stalker. The weapon? The submachine gun?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_1"><text>Oh, how good! This is an excellent weapon - reliable and tested in combat, proven and trusted. You understand what this means?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_21"><text>Now I have peace of mind, confidence, reliable protection. Take this...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_22"><text>But I still need something else, stalker...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_3"><text>Yes, I really like this weapon - excellent work! Thanks to you for the help. Let's hope that all goes well for us... Or maybe something else? Come back later...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_41"><text>Excellent cooperation.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_42"><text>Thanks for all your help.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_51"><text>Bring me an artifact, stalker.
Listen, stalker, can you still help me?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_52"><text>Further down the road, I have serious problems. There's work to do and dangerous areas to cover. And there are unexpected creatures around, when you least expect them to show up. Understand?
Listen, stalker, can you still help me?</text></string>

<string id="yurik_burer_hand_start_dialog_0"><text>What can you tell me... I need something. Alright, stalker...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_start_dialog_1"><text>I was recently in dangerous territory, saw nothing good there... Then something happened, and I needed something... but wasn't lucky enough to get proper equipment. Strange psychic mutants, burers... If I could get my hands on some psychic protection gear... Strange creatures, strange powers, mental attacks... Or even something else. Then maybe I could make some money out there, when things calm down and prices go up. Maybe, you know?
And I have something for a special artifact... yes... true, I have something for that kind of work... maybe you'd be interested in this deal.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_start_dialog_21"><text>Well, I'm counting on you, stalker! When there's an opportunity, remember, don't let me down.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_start_dialog_22"><text>Alright, stalker, but don't think getting those creatures is easy work. It's dangerous.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_start_dialog_3"><text>Don't worry, stalker. Maybe I don't know how I can repay you.</text></string>

<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_0"><text>So what, stalker, do you still need something?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_1"><text>Yes! Of course! Do you have it?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_21"><text>Very good, excellent work...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_22"><text>Here, take this, stalker...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_23"><text>Strange things here, strange happenings...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_24"><text>Good cooperation, excellent work.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_25"><text>M-m-m... good!</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_3"><text>Yes, thanks for bringing me this thing, it'll be very useful... Here's something for you, stalker.
And about that artifact - I heard there are some valuable pieces around here... Well, if you're interested, I can tell you where to look. You might be able to find some interesting artifact there. And later there might be more work available, since I know people who need certain items delivered. There are various jobs available in this place if you're interested. Everything depends on who's asking. But this is between us...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_4"><text>Alright, stalker, if you're interested...</text></string>
<string id="tex_gar_dram_novice_burer_hand"><text>\nYurik, whom you met earlier, needs you to bring him a burer's hand.</text></string>
<!-- new_Luber -->
<string id="luber_medicine_start_dialog_0"><text>Something's not going right here, stalker. Are you interested?</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_start_dialog_1"><text>I'm an underground doctor. Heard you can deliver medical supplies - bandages, medicine and such things.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_start_dialog_2"><text>But I'm not just some medic-assistant, I know serious things and medical procedures... Or maybe you have scientific articles from the surface that might be interesting. Tell me, can I count on your help with supplies? Eh-eh.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_start_dialog_3"><text>You don't understand. This is serious business needs. But I've encountered serious medical problems. I have some supplies from the surface - medicine. But I need proper equipment, real medicine, good supplies. But what do you think about getting me medicine and bandages - eh, what do you think? There are seriously injured people here, they need help and some need treatment and surgery. This depends on you, I'm waiting - soon, I hope.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_start_dialog_41"><text>Understandable, everything is fine and no serious problems. But I hope you will be cooperative, stalker. I think you should bring medical supplies from the surface, yes?</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_start_dialog_42"><text>No thanks, I have work to do, and I'm leaving.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_start_dialog_5"><text>I don't know about that...</text></string>
<string id="tex_luber_medicine_article"><text>\nThis stalker doctor wants you to bring him medicines and bandages from the surface, since they are hard to find down here.</text></string>
<!-- new_Boryan -->
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_0"><text>Greetings to you, new stalker friend.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_1"><text>What brings you to my workspace? Business person, or just passing through?</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_2"><text>Professional medic from medical school. Doctor Boryan.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_3"><text>I don't have enough supplies to work with people. And I'm missing some scientific articles, specifically "Radioactive Zone", I need to understand.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_4"><text>Yes, understood... what you need is medical supplies. Listen, I have some work, but it's not dangerous.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_5"><text>Then help me out. I'll search through files for what you need as medical supplies, and I'll give you some good medicine. Bring me an article about "Artifacts", understand this. And then I can give you some good equipment.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_6"><text>Maybe I should just be more careful than I thought?</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_7"><text>How interesting, stalker.</text></string>
<string id="tex_luber_medicine_boryan_article"><text>\nBoryan needs you to bring him a first aid kit and a scientific article about "Artifacts". He says this will help him with his work and research.</text></string>

<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_done_dlg_0"><text>So, I understand you brought something.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_done_dlg_1"><text>Oh yes, if you brought it, then let's go. Ready?</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_done_dlg_2"><text>Excellent, not yet ready.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_done_dlg_3"><text>And here are your supplies. Here's how I can help you understand medical matters. Good supplies - I hope they're useful. And here's medicine to take, safe to use - see what works.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_done_dlg_4"><text>Thanks, stalker.</text></string>

<string id="luber_medicine_done_dialog_0"><text>Stalker, still no luck finding supplies?</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_done_dialog_1"><text>Not yet, stalker... understood everything.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_done_dialog_2"><text>Bring your supplies - see how I can use them to treat patients. Good work.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_done_dialog_3"><text>Now I really need help with supplies. What do you have for me? Can you get dangerous medicine "Rad" tablets? Or maybe something else to help? Well, anything will do. If you can't get rare items, maybe you have something similar - the powerful stimulant "Su-25".</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_done_dialog_41"><text>Money payment. This is serious.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_done_dialog_42"><text>Artifact payment. Bringing serious equipment.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_done_dialog_43"><text>Ah! Excellent - that's exactly what I need.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_done_dialog_51"><text>Wonderful. Thank you very much.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_done_dialog_52"><text>Good, that's not much. Still, I understand the payment is fair.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_done_dialog_53"><text>Do I really need this artifact? Alright, but this is very expensive. Still, I'll have to agree to this.</text></string>

<string id="neumeha_container_1_dialog_0"><text>So what, stalker, how are things going?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_1_dialog_1"><text>Excellent work! If you don't mind, I'll get straight to the point. I need a container. I need to store something in it.
You see, here I'm working on some serious research and can't do it... I try, I work, but nothing good comes of it.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_1_dialog_2"><text>So what's stopping you from experimenting? From what I can see - you have money and knowledge.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_1_dialog_3"><text>Yes?! Listen, friend, exactly. I need to conduct some serious research. But I can't store anything anomalous in containers? Well, you see, I'm trying to study serious objects in peace, but they won't work. So you see, I need a container - and desperately!</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_1_dialog_4"><text>Hmm. Understood, no problem, but if you agree - I'll pay well for your help. Listen, do you know Leshiy? Have you been to the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_1_dialog_5"><text>Ah-h-h... and when I worked there, I learned nothing at all. No matter how I tried, no matter what I attempted, nothing worked out. But I don't give up. Here I continue my research. And that's how - I'm gathering everything I need and doing everything I can to get results. Here I am - a scientist-researcher. You know, these stalkers work quite professionally, and if they don't - they get into trouble. That's why I'm counting on you to get this container for me somehow...</text></string>

<string id="neumeha_container_2_dialog_0"><text>How are you, stalker-researcher? How are things?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_2_dialog_1"><text>Hello, friend... did you find a container?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_2_dialog_2"><text>Found it. I brought your container. Here's the result - the container.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_2_dialog_3"><text>A container? Oh! Great... and what would you like to receive in payment? How much do you want, tell me?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_2_dialog_41"><text>Alright, here's your payment in money.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_2_dialog_42"><text>Hmm, wait, I have money...</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_2_dialog_5"><text>OK. Let's see how much I have. Yes, this should be sufficient payment. Thank you very much.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_2_dialog_6"><text>Excellent, take everything I have. Here's something...</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_2_dialog_7"><text>Thanks! Here's your payment. Good luck, see you later.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_2_dialog_71"><text>Thanks! Here's your payment. Good luck, see you later.</text></string>

<string id="neumeha_container_3_dialog_0"><text>Good day, my colleague.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_3_dialog_1"><text>My colleague? Everything is working, friend, good. The container has served me well. Now I can work without any problems. What can I do for you?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_3_dialog_2"><text>Nothing, colleague, just wanted to know how you're getting on.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_3_dialog_3"><text>Thanks to you - very well. I'm conducting dangerous experiments. Yes! Excellent. While I was working on the experiments, I found something. Interesting? Look here, I found something unusual - brought it back home. Now I have all this research material. Maybe you could help somehow?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_3_dialog_4"><text>If something comes up, friend...</text></string>
<string id="tex_neumeha_container"><text>Neumeha urgently needs a container with anomalous properties to continue his research. He says he will pay well for this, no questions asked.</text></string>

<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_0"><text>Hello! Do you need something? Are we discussing research here?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_1"><text>Yes, that's right.
Listen, my friend, I heard that you survived in there, right?
You see, this one stalker told me that somewhere in the underground there are some very serious anomalous places. Very dangerous - how scary.
But you went there. I heard something and don't know how to approach this. Such experiments, and you don't know how to do proper research. When I hear this, I think I have problems because of that danger in exploration.
But if you could help with this, I understand everything, but everything else... Can you provide equipment for such research, hm?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_2"><text>Oh, yes! After this conversation, I do have a request - what about protective equipment straight from down there?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_3"><text>Great job! You know you can understand, and I don't know this either. Dangerous radiation exposure - and thank you! Or anomalous interference - you must know that dangerous radiation exists, and I don't understand how to protect against this kind of research.
Oh, yes, if you continue exploration and get protective equipment, I have one additional request: can you please help me find some anomalous thing? You are experienced, I believe in you. You can handle dangerous situations if needed. So how about it - are you in?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_41"><text>Alright, understood. Listen, if you're still up for it and want to help, here's what we need to do - find the equipment we discussed.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_42"><text>No, friend, if you don't want to help, I understand. Yes, I understand these things are dangerous, and you have responsibilities.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_51"><text>Excellent! I see we understand each other - you're an experienced stalker, clearly.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_52"><text>If that's the case, I trust you with something serious. Well... so be it, stalker.</text></string>

<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_0"><text>How are things progressing with finding that protective suit?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_1"><text>Oh yes... and what?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_21"><text>Still searching for it. Later.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_22"><text>Well, you don't answer, but I believe you understand your responsibilities, which are still quite important.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_31"><text>Oh no, brilliant! I don't even know. How are you interested? I know precisely how "anomalous materials" can get to a "protective suit". Understand? I want you to search for PSZ-1, okay?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_32"><text>Good, now you understand. If you don't know, I need it still functioning...</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_41"><text>Let's discuss what you need from "protective suit" functionality.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_42"><text>I understand something complicated, but I'll handle it.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_51"><text>Then I will wait for your return, and that's all for now.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_52"><text>Yes, I hope for your return. Later.</text></string>
<string id="tex_neumeha_outfit"><text>\nNeumeha heard that someone in the underground hid a very valuable protective suit. He needs it as a safety measure to conduct dangerous experiments. He knows the location of the hidden suit somewhere in this area, and he promises to share the coordinates with you in exchange for protection. The scientist suggests you visit a abandoned research facility or laboratory. Perhaps you can investigate the location yourself.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_eyes_start_dialog_0"><text>And what then?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_start_dialog_1"><text>You appeared in this place, but you didn't ask questions about payment - but still, what? I heard about your exploits here - your survivability in the Zone. Thank you for this, and you don't refuse payment. Listen! Recently one stalker - an experienced veteran - do you understand? He told me about laboratories. Listen, my friend, you don't fear danger, so how to proceed? You need help... Yes, yes, something urgent indeed, and I need to find what you're interested in.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_start_dialog_21"><text>Something dangerous? Good, stalker.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_start_dialog_22"><text>Let's hear everything. Yes, I'll handle it.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_start_dialog_3"><text>Good luck, stalker.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_eyes_done_dialog_0"><text>How did it go?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_done_dialog_1"><text>Tell me something, stalker, what you found out there, what did you discover?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_done_dialog_21"><text>Here's what I brought, as you requested.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_done_dialog_22"><text>Still haven't found it, commander.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_done_dialog_3"><text>Thanks. You still continue and don't understand what this gives to serious science for research purposes. So here's research and investigation - how the "creature" develops, or maybe its behavior patterns?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_done_dialog_41"><text>Let's discuss business, stalker, what you discovered.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_done_dialog_42"><text>Excellent work, this will have good use.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_done_dialog_51"><text>Here's research and analysis. If you continue exploration, keep searching, maybe you'll find more.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_done_dialog_52"><text>Excellent specimen... What do we have here?... Oh alright, this is impressive. Take this, stalker... Important research.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_done_dialog_6"><text>Very well. Good hunting!</text></string>
<string id="tex_gar_dolg_flesh_eye"><text>\nPrapor, the Duty faction commander at the Bar, needs you to bring him a flesh mutant eye for identification.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_jaws_start_dialog_0"><text>What happened, old friend? Dangerous situation...</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_start_dialog_1"><text>Here's the thing. Maybe you could help with something. You know, recently a stalker came by who reported what he saw - one dangerous creature. I asked him for detailed descriptions. Maybe you're interested? You know this area, right? Then tell me about the research - how "creatures" and "protective suits" can get along, or anomalous effects, something like that.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_start_dialog_21"><text>Creature? Understood.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_start_dialog_22"><text>Not really, commander, but I know that in this Zone not everything is normal.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_start_dialog_3"><text>Understood, I don't know anything more about these creatures.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_jaws_done_dialog_0"><text>Well, how did it go? Stalker, I was expecting results.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_done_dialog_1"><text>Thanks for what you brought, but this is interesting.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_done_dialog_21"><text>Here it is, commander, yes, apparently you asked for something valuable.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_done_dialog_22"><text>Alright, I'm still not ready.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_done_dialog_3"><text>If you need something, maybe I can help. What do you need as payment?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_done_dialog_41"><text>Excellent results. See what we have here.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_done_dialog_42"><text>Excellent. Of course.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_done_dialog_51"><text>I can use this for research procedures and transformation of "Bloodsucker Jaw" to "Crusher".</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_done_dialog_52"><text>Very good payment... I'll take the artifact, that's what we agreed on.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_done_dialog_6"><text>Understood.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_tails_start_dialog_0"><text>Stalker greetings... How are you?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_tails_start_dialog_1"><text>You know, serious business... Stalkers need to gather intelligence and everything will be handled properly. Think about this request - what you could get from dangerous expeditions, another safer way. But you have equipment for reconnaissance, but still what - you venture into dangerous areas... Maybe bring me something useful, and I have an artifact to share with you - "Controller Tail" it's called? Or dangerous reconnaissance in serious matters, I suggest. So how about it?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_tails_start_dialog_21"><text>Yes, you understand how dangerous it is, stalker, but it's necessary.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_tails_start_dialog_22"><text>No thanks. Of course, but I won't venture into that Zone myself because of such small matters.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_tails_start_dialog_3"><text>Here's excellent.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_tails_done_dialog_0"><text>How did it go? Stalker, I was expecting results...</text></string>
<string id="prapor_tails_done_dialog_1"><text>Very little to report, keep searching...</text></string>

<string id="plichko_td_art_start_dialog_1"><text>Greetings?! But what are you doing here?!
Well... I have a task.
Recently I learned about some anomaly-artifact in Dark Valley, and decided to retrieve the artifact. But then something happened with one of the local research groups, and they lost their equipment... Listen, friend. The artifact is there, but they're asking for some compensation.
And here you appeared, and I have no money for supplies, if you want to help. Maybe interested in cooperation? Listen, somewhere here - they still have their cache. And I will then reward you for this help.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_td_art_start_dialog_21"><text>I'm interested, cooperation is possible.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_td_art_start_dialog_22"><text>I understand - no thanks... Go search and handle business.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_td_art_start_dialog_31"><text>Then listen carefully, this concerns the artifact. I need to have equipment, and if I move on this, I'll succeed later. Think about this: then I'll get past through danger areas, and you get what you need from dangerous places. Excellent work we'll do. Search in places and anomalies, like you promised. So somewhere, as stalker, you should.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_td_art_start_dialog_32"><text>Then listen carefully, this concerns the artifact. I need to have equipment, and if I move on this, I'll succeed later. I promised you this will have benefits, and your dangerous mission is clear, now you need to understand. You here, you and I have and search for this area, what I suggested. After that serious danger, if you manage all this. Something for you to retrieve and search in anomalies, yes still you need serious protective equipment. Excellent work we'll do. Somewhere in that place and search, and share with scientists.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_td_art_start_dialog_33"><text>Then listen carefully, this concerns the artifact. I need to have equipment, and if I move on this, I'll succeed later. I promised you this will have benefits, and your dangerous mission is clear. You here, you and I have and search for this area, what I suggested. After that serious danger, if you manage all this. Maybe from your areas you'll retrieve serious valuable anomalies - serious value materials, keep this. Excellent work we'll accomplish. Somewhere in that place and search, and share with scientists.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_td_art_start_dialog_4"><text>Good cooperation, but dangerous business. So be careful.</text></string>

<string id="plichko_td_art_done_dialog_0"><text>Hello, stalker. How are things going with the search?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_td_art_done_dialog_1"><text>Very good... Thanks for the artifact you found, excellent work.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_td_art_done_dialog_21"><text>Here's what I brought for our cooperation, friend.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_td_art_done_dialog_22"><text>After I find more, then we'll have cooperation.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_td_art_done_dialog_3"><text>So much good cooperation. Very impressive, stalker.
Now I have equipment, friend - excellent.
Good hunting!</text></string>
<string id="tex_bar_dolg_base_guard_art"><text>\nLocal stalker, nicknamed "Bullet", recently went and found an artifact in Dark Valley, somewhere in that area. If you bring this artifact, we can arrange good payment for this "Bullet"</text></string>

<string id="plichko_art_back_dialog_0"><text>I don't think that's really necessary.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_art_back_dialog_11"><text>Hmm. I can't manage without this, what do you think?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_art_back_dialog_12"><text>Thing. One serious problem. Dangerous or later, you understand this.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_art_back_dialog_2"><text>You know what, comrade - this artifact is very much needed for serious things. So maybe give it back to me?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_art_back_dialog_3"><text>Well-l-ll...
Oh! Alright. Understood! The thing is serious - I don't know.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_art_back_dialog_41"><text>A-ah! How do I have some kind of problem?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_art_back_dialog_42"><text>Here is the artifact. The thing! Later.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_art_back_dialog_51"><text>So what problems happened... I understand later, but your equipment requirements are legitimate.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_art_back_dialog_52"><text>So here I don't argue! Take the artifact here. I hope I find later something of serious value for research, but you need dangerous equipment...</text></string>

<string id="artmod_841_dialog_0"><text>Listen, friend, I understand you're into research? Time is still quite important - yes, I continue experiments for artifact investigation?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_841_dialog_1"><text>Do I have what interests you? I don't understand your thinking, but here's an option for research. You're a stalker, and as such, a serious stalker working in dangerous places with serious threats. If you found a dangerous artifact, you need something special for research. I thought you and I understand - as a stalker, you deal with dangerous anomalous modifications from serious experiments. You've been to dangerous areas and succeeded there. But I know about modifications and who researches them...\nYou're a serious stalker, which means I can conduct dangerous research. You work in stalker areas with artifact success and in modification areas. You work with serious artifacts in these areas and possibly other anomalous things too. If you have something seriously anomalous like "... so...", then I have a serious stalker to work with. Thank you very much, stalker! If you know what dangerous areas are like, I have serious modification work for stalkers - artifact success in your areas. I heard that in the Zone, stalkers can get anything. So, what interests you?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_841_dialog_21"><text>Yes, I exactly understand this, and I have quite serious research here. Thanks for this, I promised that the artifact modifications will be ready, since you have dangerous areas.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_841_dialog_22"><text>You're not a serious stalker? No, stalker, these are serious artifact modifications, and you do research for stalkers.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_841_dialog_3"><text>Thanks to you and to research...</text></string>

<string id="artmod_842_dialog_31"><text>Oh, stalker, I have so much serious stalker work for you!
You're a stalker, a real stalker. Serious, dangerous. I'm still working seriously - here, take the equipment.

<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_42"><text>Understand. Need to find artifact.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_5"><text>That depends on us. Money is important. You understand this - rumors have been spreading.
Listen, I understand. I have equipment - what I need to get from serious valuable research objects. Electromagnetic device, stalker, if you understand. But you have to successfully find this equipment. Equipment for stalkers, delivered here to cooperation experiments, but experiments in serious research can be conducted successfully. How much money?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_6"><text>How to find? Where? Maybe bought, stalker - I don't know where, maybe stolen? Or maybe they found anomalous equipment? Maybe you know where this might be found?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_7"><text>Look, I have money and the necessary electromagnetic equipment. This is serious work, and serious research, and results. Equipment of course, listen, understand, what exactly you need. This equipment will help you work on electromagnetic circuits, what this provides good protection. Research all has a good how, so still equipment and serious research. Type electromagnetic device. Equipment provides all protection from three devices in all situations, and, listen, should all and somewhere find.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_8"><text>Listen, I have good money, what's up? Maybe you and I can work something out?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_9"><text>Yes, that's right. In the Zone, stalker, I need to have serious money for working with experiments. You listen to me - when I try to work with research. But what - I can work on serious research with your money on serious research equipment. Listen friend, I have somewhere. Understand, we both work here together.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_10"><text>You understand me quite seriously in electromagnetic work. Understand what I need from you - some serious equipment.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_11"><text>This is not simple. If you can obtain the serious device we need, then all will be simple: through connection and research, listen - how money ready, and how money...
So here's serious money, and work - thing ready, how money in all research. All this maybe be research for device. I have serious electromagnetic, and all understand what we can research in this equipment.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_12"><text>Hmm... actually, I don't really need experiments on this kind of serious work. I have something else to consider.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_13"><text>So still I believe, and all understand. See. If so you device operational will be, then I can research it for you. Yes, If research device, thing understand. Device to you Or equipment and so understand, so research in Zone, thing I believe, what research something and all you research.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_14"><text>Yes, alright. Good hunting.</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_done_dlg_0"><text>Serious work! You have serious work, you're serious about artifacts!</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_done_dlg_1"><text>Good, stalker... Electromagnetic?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_done_dlg_2"><text>Yes exactly, I understand, but listen - what... excellent equipment.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_643_dialog_3"><text>Area... area... area work - you're a stalker. Scientists, area work for stalkers - how dangerous you are to me.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_541_dialog_0"><text>You work in areas! You're dangerous, you're a stalker, and so...</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_1"><text>Your work - so many modifications, stalker. Serious stalker artifact.
Artifact - so you and dangerous artifact, so areas?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_2"><text>What's so serious?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_3"><text>Sakharov requested ready ready device experimental in research laboratory laboratory teleporter equipment-equipment equipment experimental...</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_4"><text>What?! Do you even understand what was said?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_5"><text>I know that anomalous equipment and research - when serious experiments are conducted somewhere for serious research, he said that anomalous work requires serious cooperation. Therefore, if possible, cooperation between our scientific collaborations "North" and "Clear Sky".</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_6"><text>Really, how did they manage to do all this in one night? No way!</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_7"><text>Well, that was quite a commotion. Now everything is quiet... Listen, this is all nonsense about alien origin. Anomalous zones, anomalous phenomena - and I even saw lights in the forbidden sky, because the phenomena have nothing supernatural about them. And what about artifacts? We don't know anything, because we have very little knowledge.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_8"><text>I have some doubts whether there might be some anomalous phenomena? Maybe I don't need anything more?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_9"><text>Well, here we are researching something somewhere and found something! I don't hide the fact that I don't know everything about them. Listen, this is very dangerous - believe me, it's dangerous being here, and how much more it will be, I don't know. So what?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_10"><text>Something interesting? How can I help you?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_11"><text>Anomalous zones are dangerous. All that we know and need is like common knowledge, that's all. But of course yes, we are forbidden to interfere with them.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_12"><text>What you said - common knowledge? We don't know anything. How is it possible - can you imagine that we could interfere, if all the time it's happening somewhere? Aren't you being too curious?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_13"><text>Perhaps... maybe. What do you want? What's happening, stalker?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_14"><text>Yes, maybe, now I know. Someone came by and asked about this.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_542_dialog_0"><text>Finally I have some time. Ready?</text></string>

<string id="artmod_542_dialog_2"><text>Excellent.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_542_dialog_3"><text>Thanks for this great help. Need anything else, or what?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_542_dialog_41"><text>Perfect, see the result.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_542_dialog_42"><text>This is truly an artifact, one that has undergone enhancement.</text></string>

<string id="tex_yan_kruglov_decoder"><text>\nHello, this decoder device. In these words perhaps contained information about helicopters V-16 similar to civilian radio equipment</text></string>

<string id="artmod_641_dialog_0"><text>Am I dangerous? Areas?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_641_dialog_1"><text>I don't understand, but you're not dangerous. Naturally, I won't send you there. Sakharov asked me to help. I recently found an artifact and conducted experiments. Compared to laboratories, we obtained anomalous unlimited energy. Need the container and some protection, and all we have - nothing. The Zone contains areas where we can't go alone because of electromagnetic interference, but I have experience there with how "ghosts" can appear.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_641_dialog_21"><text>Alright, artifacts in stalker areas.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_641_dialog_22"><text>No, stalker, you're serious and dangerous.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_641_dialog_3"><text>Then, be careful. Safe road.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_642_dialog_0"><text>Stalker... excellent.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_642_dialog_1"><text>So how? Everything successful?</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_x18docs_start_0"><text>Greetings - I hope you don't mind that you stumbled upon something very interesting. Let me explain everything.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_start_1"><text>Ah-ah, as I understand it... As I understand, you've visited underground facilities and laboratory complexes at laboratory X-18, am I right?
But do you think there might still be some surviving materials from the research projects that were conducted there before the catastrophe? I suggest the following - if you find several intact research documents from that place. Most importantly, everything should be preserved in cabinets and storage in some secure area or vault. Here I need specific information.
My people have told me that compensation will be generous. If you can bring authentic research materials from that location, you can receive substantial payment for this work. How does this sound to you? Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_start_21"><text>Hmm... I understand, but there's nothing we can do.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_start_22"><text>Excellent, then I hope you return with some valuable materials.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_0"><text>I found some documents at laboratory X-18.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_21"><text>Perfect. Here you go. This is what I found.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_22"><text>Ah, unfortunately, there's still nothing there. But everything is still under investigation.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_3"><text>Yes, let me see. This looks important for understanding our work, excellent...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_4"><text>Yes, of course, thank you. So what do you need in return - compensation? I'll pay you myself.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_510"><text>Very-very... Valuable papers... High-quality information... Simply no doubt...
There is nothing superfluous. Indeed. I pay as promised. Perhaps there could be additional valuable materials?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_511"><text>Yes, thank you... Good. Payment still follows.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_512"><text>Yes, naturally. I have enough for several more experiments.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_513"><text>Excellent. What, yes... This requires additional work still.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_520"><text>Very-very... Valuable papers... High-quality information... Simply no doubt...\nAnd what's this? Papers from scientific experiments... Ah! Yes, this is what I found! You have, I have samples... How incredibly lucky! I couldn't even dream of getting such materials... Yes, excellent, excellent.\nExcellent, you brought some experimental documents! Moreover, I see that they have remarkable preservation and still... Please consider this as compensation for experimental samples for advanced studies called "Clear Sky". However, what are these phenomena? How did such incredible radioactivity appear in the Zone and processes that seem here to occur just recently? Do you understand what effects we can achieve with such technology? Even if we achieve only a small part. Let me say this briefly about what can be valuable scientific effects from this or something similar... However, I'll provide more details in exchange for this: each artifact contains some incredible field effects. Secondly, your payment for such valuable scientific work.</text></string>
<string id="tex_yan_scientist_books"><text>\nScience needs research reports from laboratory X-18 and results from their experiments, so I collected papers for research. Papers with results in books or reports. All papers with results that you find will be valuable.</text></string>

<string id="resiept_activ_anom_info_text"><text>

Secret information researchers discovered about anomalous activation: If you place the artifact "Electrostatic Crystal" in certain locations with electromagnetic interference in anomaly "Mincer" (strong radiation effects and energy emissions, maintaining stable field while active), then this artifact transforms into a new one with incredible anomalous properties! Such an effect - "Mincer" - occurs when coming into contact, transforming into powerful electromagnetic field. For electromagnetic effects in combination with radioactive materials from anomalous sources (see notes on research), it's necessary to study anomalous material effects, and place materials in the location where anomalous effects occur - the anomaly %c[UI_orange]"Mosquito"!
%c[default]For this "Mincer" creates incredible new anomalous effects, connected to transformational processes of other artifacts. Results show excellent artifact potential.</text></string>

<string id="volk_simbion_start_5"><text>What exactly brought you to this abandoned place? Looking for something? Maybe artifacts, or perhaps there's something else you're after?</text></string>

<string id="volk_simbion_start_9"><text>What kind of things are we talking about? Alright, I'm listening. Thanks. Explain everything if you would. I'm interested.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_start_10"><text>Excellent. Let's get started.</text></string>

<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_0"><text>Have you brought me that precious artifact?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_1"><text>You haven't brought it yet. Still searching for something - that precious artifact, or... ?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_2"><text>Exactly, what else? Listen, friend. I've been in the Zone for quite some time now - seen many things - encountered strange anomalies and artifacts. Many stalkers believe that artifacts are just crystallized energy, as I understand it. But I've learned something more curious, something extraordinary, something incredible... What I've discovered here recently in this desolate and forsaken place, changes everything. Changed my understanding of how this world works, generally. And I'm still continuing to seek new discoveries. Particularly curious is whether "Symbiont" is something truly extraordinary? Perhaps you know more about this artifact, and in the near future you could help me acquire one?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_3"><text>Maybe, that's right, stalker. But something else - who are you, where are you from? And here I have a question for you: why would anyone need an artifact if everything about them is already well known? Understand, what can you offer me? What I need isn't simple - it's complex. If you find such an artifact, let me know immediately. Or, maybe, you want to cooperate?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_4"><text>You don't believe in miracles, and I don't believe in coincidences either, so what can we do about it? I don't know what else I can do. Can you think about what we should do in this situation? Tell me, have you heard anything about "Symbiont" artifacts before? Many different rumors, some true, some lies... what do you think? Or don't you believe that such artifacts exist?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_5"><text>Possibly, but I'm not the only one searching, and there are others interested in this place. Perhaps someone else knows what such artifacts can do in reality... who knows.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_6"><text>Listen, I understand... I was saying that cooperation isn't forbidden. Believe me, I'm ready for any work, any business, both mine and yours. I'm convinced that sooner or later we'll find something in the Zone. And while I'm continuing my research work, you know everything better, if anomalous manifestations happen to be near you. You understand everything better. I think we'll find common ground. And here, if you encounter some special phenomena, let me know. You know what I need.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_7"><text>Here's what, stalker? Good, I think we understand each other. When I find something, yes I'll contact you immediately. By the way, maybe later we can discuss "artifacts" in more detail.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_8"><text>If you continue searching as well. Yes, I agree.</text></string>

<string id="volk_simbion_give_0"><text>Excellent, I was hoping for this, friend.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_1"><text>Brought it? Ah, excellent work, congratulations. Whoever you are, you did exactly what I asked for. And now I need to examine, analyze and study the artifact's structure properly. You know what, I think we need to call this "Symbiont" artifact. But I don't know yet what this means, generally speaking, maybe special container storage, which I already have. Excellent, maybe you could help me understand more about such phenomena.
Anomalous manifestations and research on the nature of these phenomena, stalker, is what I'm truly passionate about. You can learn a lot from observations: some people become stronger, others become weaker. Some say "artifacts," others say "not artifacts." And in certain cases, scientific-experimental research of these unusual places occurs. And everything becomes clearer. Strange things, but you shouldn't doubt science, respect knowledge, some special "Symbiont" artifacts. But here, something tells me that every stalker can encounter anomalies in such places. And I'm still researching these "artifact" phenomena, maybe through scientific methods. And you, friend, also have your observations.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_2"><text>Should I then give you... payment?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_3"><text>Listen, are you joking around, eh?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_4"><text>Alright, alright, enough. Understood.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_5"><text>Perfect, as expected, I appreciate the service. Listen, generally, there's still work to be done. Stalker work doesn't end with delivery, something else needs to be done. True, I can't pay immediately, since yes it's different. Then I have some other business, important matters, but I'll deliver payment and transfer it to your hands. You understand, yes I'm also dependent on others. Cooperation yes requires patience.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_51"><text>Well understood, let's go see what comes of this.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_52"><text>I understand... 
This is serious work. I don't know much about science, and what I do know isn't important. Yes, friend, you should understand, but don't worry - you helped me with this, stalker. That's it, working with such matters requires patience. I don't understand everything: some things are clear, others not. There are still questions in my head... I search and study phenomena, how these manifestations work, when they occur, where they occur. How extraordinary discoveries, when I understand, I don't doubt cooperation, yes meaningful cooperation. And, of course, you could help me further, but there are still many questions about different phenomena. All this, but still everything is in our hands. Strange cooperation, mutual benefit. Maybe I have some other anomalous cooperation. You understand that this isn't simple work, but everything will work out as it should. I don't know if it will work. Yes, what you brought, maybe we can work together. Some time will pass and I won't have such artifact phenomena, maybe we'll work something out together. And I, my friend, generally speaking, friend, could use help. You could help me complete this work.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_53"><text>So, friend, I don't think that everything we talked about will end unsuccessfully?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_54"><text>Still I'm interested in whether those "Symbiont" manifestations, that's what I'm studying and researching. Listen stalker... \nHere's a question: "Ah you, friend, you've been thinking about anomalies, but still where am I in this place? What kinds of strange things, which we know. We know about unique manifestations. If many phenomena, what there - everything is simple on the surface, and if someone wants to study more, what they're looking for. The work is still in initial stages. Probably not all, perhaps, maybe, who and when, or something else". I can't answer everything. Many questions, different phenomena. Alright, stalker: "If someone wants to study phenomena, probably it's worth paying. The military won't help. But I'm in this place, and I have strange work and other things". \nOn phenomena - depending on manifestations, somehow different work on such occasions, but I study how this all works. Nothing bad about it. Problems still. I gave you those rubles, what I gave, what in cash, and problems with this payment. The artifact brought me a decent income from such manifestations. True, how to know, I'm still working and there's more work for me, sometimes I don't expect results, and later somewhere I'll conduct research... Probably, I'll figure it out. It's up to you, while my work isn't finished, depending on such other things. Stalker work sometimes gives such new findings.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_61"><text>Understood. Every time I prove myself very much interested, especially when dealing with such unusual artifacts. Yes, as I heard, there can be problems with different stalkers.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_62"><text>Something like that, but I don't really know. Artifact "Symbiont" called, right?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_71"><text>I understand, friend, you don't need to know. Here, what I think, we should have, and here, what I can do... you should go search in these strange anomalies. Believe me, I understand, and how you and I in this unusual place could work together, and, maybe, just search somewhere nearby. Yes, generally, here's what... If something unusual happens, you could find me. Believe me, I'm here, you could help in some other matters.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_72"><text>Yes you understand, maybe, and me. Cooperation problems? I have questions about unusual work. True, maybe for you this work isn't very difficult, but for me everything is clear and I don't know what to do. Understand?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_811"><text>Alright, good work you did there. And now - take this. Accept this payment. I appreciate your work, as promised.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_812"><text>Alright, good work you did there. And now - take this. Accept this payment. Believe me, I also have work ahead. Listen, everything worked out well, I'm grateful.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_821"><text>Listen, let's go further and search for new phenomena. Here, generally, are the results. I appreciate the work, as promised.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_822"><text>Listen, let's go further and search for new phenomena. Here, generally, are the results. Believe me, I also have work ahead. Listen, everything worked out well, I'm grateful.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_9"><text>Nothing I need is forgotten, yes I appreciate the work you did for me. This completes everything. If you want to continue cooperation in the future, you can contact me. And while I have what I have. Yes, I know that you helped me, thanks. And here, maybe we can work together, understanding.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_921"><text>What, everything is in place. Container managed, you handled it well, and there's still little left to finish properly, excellent. I appreciate the cooperation on the matter. Thanks.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_922"><text>All research is done. I understand... Yes, this is it! Excellent stalker, what I collected won't disappoint on the matter, for this time everything is finished. Yes, container managed, you handled it well, and there's still little left to finish properly, excellent.</text></string>

<string id="volk_simbion_final_0"><text>You want to research the artifact and continue the experiment...</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_1"><text>Know what? Listen, if you understand?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_2"><text>Yes, I was looking for some laboratory, in Dark Valley, here it is in this place.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_3"><text>How? I heard that there's nothing in the abandoned complex.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_4"><text>Possibly, but this isn't complex. I think, maybe we don't have such problems, but in unusual situations, consider.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_5"><text>And everything is fine, when you search in abandoned places? Maybe some things could be in strange situations? Maybe there are different places here and there in the abandoned complex. Generally, if there are, maybe they know.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_6"><text>This isn't clear. Depending on situations and details. I understand, somehow, cooperation is possible or impossible. And I'm in a difficult place. But I know.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_7"><text>Yes... when I was conducting research, exactly as I wanted to understand it. That sounds familiar: "I am here - I don't need anything else."</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_8"><text>And how I understand, stalker?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_9"><text>Well... but I must say, you helped me understand the problem, but I'm grateful. And I learned how this works. But this is beyond comprehension...</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_10"><text>So yes. Called this artifact "Symbiont", received about 10 thousand "rubles" for that work, what I did for you. Really good payment for such extraordinary work. Here, friend, everything has become clear: behind everything was your help, whoever you are, you helped me in my research. Perhaps you know that I'm not from this place and we're different people. Or mistaken?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_11"><text>Possibly, do you want to continue cooperation or prefer farewell? If so, maybe we'll meet again, maybe I'll still need your services. Yes I won't disappoint, there's still work to do here in this complex. All this is simple: either we work together, or we part ways.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_12"><text>Alright, I hope we have a common understanding here. What can I offer you?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_13"><text>As I think, our research at this abandoned complex can continue. This could be the road to success, but I don't know exactly what we'll find. Here's understanding, now there's work for both of us together. Maybe there will be continued anomalous research phenomena. Maybe some interesting work. Perhaps, I could maybe help you. Or maybe we'll encounter anomalous phenomena.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_14"><text>Fine. Go on, understood.</text></string>

<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_0"><text>Is everything working properly?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_1"><text>Excellent, listen, can I ask you to help with equipment transport? Can you help me transport and solve problems? For stalker work and cooperation, understand.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_2"><text>Problems? I'm not a scientist, why would I know such things? Or am I mistaken about something? I still don't understand!</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_3"><text>Hmm-hmm, stalker, you understand very little about this.</text></string> 
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_4"><text>Yes fine, you're right, stalker - there's still a problem. What do you want?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_5"><text>Listen here... I have several measurement devices in working condition. I understand, measurement devices work perfectly, but I can't get proper scientific equipment here. Scientific equipment needs specialized tools for measurements, calculations and other important work. And I need to set up there some complex processes with proper equipment. Scientific research requires this.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_6"><text>And so, experimental and research work is complex, maybe you know, what can I do?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_7"><text>Generally, maybe I won't need scientists. Now well, I can understand, really that I have scientific knowledge and work. Scientific work requires this, and what I do with my research should complement all the same. That will be, friend, contact me if you agree. If everything works correctly, as I understand, contact me and we'll resolve everything, but I'm grateful, that scientific work gets completed properly, and you'll help me with difficult equipment. And precisely: we'll work together on these scientific projects, on what we can really do. Or maybe something interesting, some place, then maybe we'll find artifacts should be in strange places and in other dangerous zones. Tell me, who else in the Zone could help conduct such research?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_8"><text>Standard work, when everything is ready. And what do you suggest exactly? But how I understand, maybe I can contact you, when everything gets to these locations?</text></string> 
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_9"><text>Maybe some work, what we should do isn't simple. Yes. That means, what experimental opportunity requires little specialized work, as I... understand in general this is complex. Yes, I think, everything is correct, complex arrangements for specialized science equipment. You should do research. Maybe depending on equipment, as it's installed... yes, you understand. Research - result.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_10"><text>You have problems and what is happening. But it's very hard to solve problems on these science measurements. I should work and I don't have sufficient time. What cooperation?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_11"><text>Here, generally, I could have specialized tools.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_12"><text>These specialized complex measurements. If stalker works on the matter, he can find much on Marsh, stalker could here know more...</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_13"><text>Here I have work with measurements. Stalker should understand how this all works with measurements. Equipment good, complex, specialized. But stalker knows better, problems and difficult work could be on stalker. We scientists should provide stalker on such complex equipment and devices. Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_14"><text>Stalker, excellent, good... and what about this?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_15"><text>If stalker understands, yes, that you understand. Stalker good, complex, but cooperation.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_16"><text>I understand, while stalker deals with everything. Maybe, later.</text></string>
<!-- ������ -->
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_0"><text>I don't doubt anything, I concentrate on research. Measurements still in place?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_1"><text>Really?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_21"><text>I just understand, but I want in time, what complex equipment.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_22"><text>At this moment, you know what I need. Thanks stalker.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_3"><text>Then I'm here. I believe in your help, more specialized measurements. Yes, if I can, we cooperate with such equipment, work, consider complex. But I need stalker to establish stable communication with such matter, and I have in scientific stalker better transport - this we could in stalker cooperation.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_4"><text>Understood exactly.</text></string>  

<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_0"><text>Good work, friend.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_1"><text>Works fine? You brought me what?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_2"><text>Brought equipment and measurement tools, what you requested here, as I promised.\nAnd, does everything work? Excellent work, excellent, you helped!</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_3"><text>Yes, understood, excellent! Stalker, good cooperation. I should work with this thing. Little problems, but we all know. Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_4"><text>Hmm. Exactly. What stalker?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_5"><text>Stalker should understand such more complex. Going through stalker. Need stalker complex.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_6"><text>While I continue complex.</text></string>
<!-- ��������� ���� -->
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_0"><text>Stalker, what you are looking for, measurements?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_1"><text>Yes. Scientists received maps and specialized complex on radiation and for our research "Average Zone". We received equipment, what still working for phenomena. Agreed? Research is here - stalker and equipment.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_21"><text>Average Zone, equipment... we really interesting place, how you work. Perhaps, here you - phenomena maps complex.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_22"><text>I just understand, but I want in time, what complex equipment.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_3"><text>Excellent, here here, here and here. Stalker good - received all maps and phenomena maps: later received new such phenomena and phenomena experimental stalker stalker cooperation.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_4"><text>Understand, scientific on measurements.</text></string>

<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_done_0"><text>Stalker, good! Stalker provided on phenomena and Average Zone. You all know. Stalker, complex work completed, and we how have studies all.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_done_1"><text>We understand - understood. Let's go here, good excellent.</text></string>

<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_0"><text>Equipment here complex systems? I studied here with measurements.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_1"><text>Listen, but I examined maps and here 65 on radiation measurements? "Radio Fog", if you-stalker.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_21"><text>Radio Fog? How you understand complex equipment, when you in such dangerous with stalkers, when there "radiation" complex. You provide to many systems on radiation. You all know here in such place phenomena. You understand, what I have here complex. You stalker, of course I know, but I don't know, stalker can stalker on phenomena. And know, how stalker, here stalker and stalker?</text></string>
