<string id="tex_mil_lukash_find_dinamit"><text>The leader of the "Freedom" faction needs dynamite. With its help, they will blow up the blockage that prevents direct communication between the Freedom base territory and Foggy Thicket. According to Lukash, the dynamite should be with the scientists in the Swamp.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_0"><text>Bootlegger said you need a reliable person?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_1"><text>We need one. We have an entrance to a collector behind the headquarters building, not exactly a collector... well, it's a big pipe. From documents found here, we were able to establish that it's like an evacuation passage that leads far beyond the base, somewhere to Foggy Thicket. As you understand, a new route would be very handy for us, bypassing Duty territory. The problem is that this passage is heavily blocked and without a good directed explosion, there's no way to clear all this. And to organize an explosion of suitable power, we need dynamite. At least a crate. I heard that the nerds who settled in the Swamp have a supply of explosives. How about it, can you negotiate and bring some? You'll be able to use this passage yourself later.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_21"><text>Alright, I'll try to get you some dynamite.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_22"><text>No, dragging a crate of explosives halfway across the Zone - life didn't prepare me for that.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_3"><text>I guarantee a good reward, you definitely won't be left empty-handed.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_dinamit_have_0"><text>About the dynamite, I...</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_have_1"><text>Did you go? How did it turn out?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_have_21"><text>Yes. Here, they gave it to me. Careful... Take it.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_have_22"><text>I went, but didn't bring anything yet. Working on it.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_have_3"><text>Well, thank you. Here, I'm sending you a waypoint on your PDA just in case, where the passage starts. I think when you visit us next time, we'll have finished clearing the blockage. And here's the promised reward.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_have_4"><text>Thanks, see you soon.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_0"><text>I need explosives.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_1"><text>What do I care what you need?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_2"><text>Well, I didn't put it right. Someone says you can get explosives from you guys. Is that true or not?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_3"><text>Hmm... People sure like to talk! Well, there's a little. Just in case... Not for sale!</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_4"><text>What am I supposed to do? I really, really need it. Surely there's some option?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_51"><text>Well... There's one way. If you're not pressed for time, as they say... Our eggheads can't test one theory. About oversized broilers. They gave me their wish: whoever gets a piece from him, from the giant that is, gets honor and respect. Or, as in our case, dynamite and goodbye. I can give you a tip. Hunters said there's a local butcher in the Gut, calls himself Prosha. He might help you with this matter. Clear?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_611"><text>Yeah! I happen to have one with me! Take it.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_612"><text>A piece from a giant? I don't even know...</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_52"><text>Well... There's one way. If you're not pressed for time, as they say... Our eggheads can't test one theory. About how mutants like controllers came to be. They gave me their wish: whoever gets some genetic material from him, from a controller that is, gets honor and respect. Or, as in our case, dynamite and goodbye. I can give you a tip.

<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_53"><text>Well... There's one way. If you're not pressed for time, as they say... Our eggheads can't test one theory. About poltergeists.

Our guys said there's a local butcher in the Gut, calls himself Prosha. He might help you with this matter. Clear?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_631"><text>Yeah! I happen to have one with me! Here.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_632"><text>A poltergeist eye? I don't even know...</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit_need_7"><text>Wow! Look how prepared you are, didn't expect that... Well, since we're having such a party, take the crate. Just don't strain yourself, drop it - your soul goes to heaven, and on earth there'll be just one dirty stain left. Handle it gently, like a maiden.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_0"><text>About that dynamite...</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_11"><text>We discussed it all already! Bring a piece of giant, then we can talk about explosives.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_611"><text>Yep, I got a little piece the size of a cow's nostril. Here.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_612"><text>Stubborn? Well, alright... Let's see.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_12"><text>We discussed it all already! Bring a controller part, then we can talk about explosives.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_621"><text>Yeah, I remember. Here. Got it. Had to work for it.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_622"><text>Stubborn? Well, alright... Let's see.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_13"><text>We discussed it all already! Bring a poltergeist eye, then we can talk about explosives.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_631"><text>Well yes, yes. Here, look, the little eye is looking at you.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_632"><text>Stubborn? Well, alright... Let's see.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_dinamit2_need_7"><text>Wow! You're quite resourceful, didn't expect that... Well, since we're having such a party, take the crate. Just don't strain yourself, drop it - your soul goes to heaven, and on earth there'll be just one dirty stain left. Handle it gently, like a maiden.</text></string>

<string id="tex_sakharov_rf_way_article"><text>\nProfessor Sakharov, working in the bunker at Yantar, asked to bring him a third-level artifact in excellent condition, or a "Dummy" class artifact in any condition. After this, he will provide coordinates for a safe path to Red Forest through Yantar.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_start_dlg_0"><text>At Bar they hinted about a safe route to Red Forest through these parts...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_start_dlg_1"><text>Yes, there is such a route. But, as you say, it's tit for tat. We're currently preparing to conduct another series of experiments and urgently need additional anomalous samples. Bring us a 3rd level artifact, and I'll show you the way. But please, the artifact must be of excellent quality. So to speak, with minimal "wear". If you bring a dummy class artifact, I'll accept it in any condition.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_start_dlg_2"><text>Well then, I'll try to find one.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_0"><text>About the route to Red Forest.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_1"><text>Did you bring an artifact? Come on, come on... What do you have there?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_21"><text>Will this one work?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_22"><text>This one seems to be from the dummies. Will it do?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_23"><text>Haven't gotten any suitable artifacts yet.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_3"><text>Yes... just the thing, thank you.\nLook, we checked... I'll show you on the map - here, behind the buildings of this factory complex, there's a safe path that leads straight to the so-called Red Forest. See?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_4"><text>Yeah, thanks, professor!</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_51"><text>By the way, there is an alternative way to get to that territory from the area called Army Warehouses. I can see from your face that you didn't know about this. Mmm... as a sign of gratitude for your fruitful cooperation with our science department, I'll mark this passage for you completely free of charge.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_52"><text>But I wouldn't recommend going there without good equipment. Very dangerous place.\nIf you do go there, I have a request. A group of our colleagues who went there last month disappeared, and we have no news from them at all. If you find their traces, please let me know. The uncertainty... you know, we're all worried here. Their base was in an old excavation, near the entrance to the nature preserve.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_61"><text>And thanks again! Maybe there's something else to help science with?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_62"><text>Dangerous? Probably need good weapons... That's at Agroprom, you'll have to deal with the military. There was a chance to get some good equipment there. But until I go back and forth... And I'll keep your request in mind.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_71"><text>I have a request, just in case you decide to visit Red Forest. A group of our colleagues who went there last month disappeared, and we have no news from them at all. If you find their traces, please let me know.

Very dangerous place.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_72"><text>You mean the Agroprom Research Institute? There's a safe path directly from us there. At least, soldiers used to come running here. We sometimes take their mail and forward it to the "mainland", and occasionally we even manage to organize telephone communication.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_821"><text>I think I know one "soldier" who I can ask about this topic. See you later, prof!</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_rf_way_done_dlg_822"><text>Right! I know about the short path from here to "Agroprom"... completely slipped my mind.</text></string>
<string id="tex_yan_scientist_find_case"><text>\nThey say there's a path from Agroprom to Yantar. Should ask the deserter Valuev about this.</text></string>

<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_0"><text>Repairing stuff?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_11"><text>Yeah, fixing things bit by bit. Here, bringing this Duty armor to decent condition. I can patch yours up too or replace the glass on a broken mask if needed. What you got there?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_12"><text>Can't you see I'm busy? Don't bother me while I'm working, alright?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_13"><text>We agreed that you'd find out how to refuel the flamethrower and tell me. Keep your word, then we can talk about repairs.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_14"><text>We agreed that you'd get me a "Cobblestone" artifact. Remember? Keep your word, then we can talk about repairs.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_211"><text>Well, you can see what condition my armor is in... Can you repair it?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_212"><text>I need the glass replaced on my mask, and patch it up too...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_213"><text>Right now I don't need anything fixed. Just asking for future reference.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_22"><text>Okay, okay, stop whining.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_23"><text>U-u-uh, I haven't found out yet...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_24"><text>U-u-uh, haven't found one yet...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_311"><text>Sure thing. I've had to fix worse stuff than this. You got the dough?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_312"><text>Are you kidding? There are holes the size of a fist here... In short - these are rags, not a suit.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_313"><text>Hmm. This is special leather. Flesh hide, if I'm not mistaken. They make especially durable coats from this, but only master leatherworkers can repair them. Seems like only Stepanych takes on such work in the Zone. I know he used to appear frequently in the Swamp, but now I have no idea where to look for him.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_314"><text>Well I'll be... I can't understand what this surface is treated with?! Wow! The material seems familiar, but where does such durability come from? Nah, you know what, I probably won't take this on. I foresee too much hassle, waste of time.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_32"><text>No problem. Let's see what we have here... Ah, there's about an hour's work here. But you'll have to leave the armor itself too. I'll need to check everything thoroughly. My services will cost you </text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_4111"><text>Well... expensive, of course, but I agree. Go ahead and repair it.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_4112"><text>Man, you really loaded up that price. I'm not ready for such expenses yet.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_412"><text>I understand. I wasn't really hoping for much anyway.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_413"><text>Should contact Stepanych then? Got it, thanks.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_414"><text>Well, suit yourself...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_421"><text>Expensive though... Alright, I'm flush with cash right now. Get to work.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_422"><text>How much-how much? No, that's way too much...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_5"><text>Already getting started. Just don't stand over my shoulder, alright? When it's ready, I'll let Garik, the guard, know.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_6"><text>Deal.</text></string>

<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_0"><text>How's the repair going? Ready?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_1"><text>U-uh... did you bring something? There are many of you, but only one of me. Can't remember everything.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_21"><text>What are you talking about? I just came by recently, asked you to replace the glass on my mask and fix it up in general...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_22"><text>What are you talking about? I just came by recently, left my armor with you, come on, remember...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_31"><text>Relax, I'm just joking. I have all transactions recorded. Work's done, take your suit.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_32"><text>"The haircut has just begun." Ever see that old Soviet cartoon?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_41"><text>Joker, damn. Alright, let's move on.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_42"><text>Got the hint.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_411"><text>Wait, did you see that the whole mask on this suit is broken? You need to replace the glass if you don't want to croak from breathing all kinds of poison at the Warehouses or Wild Territory.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_412"><text>Wait, are you aware that this suit is full of holes and tears, which means it'll let poisonous atmosphere through? You need to patch it up if you don't want to croak from breathing all kinds of nastiness at the Warehouses or Wild Territory.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_413"><text>Come on, why did you get all grumpy immediately? Stalkers have no sense of humor...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_repair_end_5"><text>Thanks for the warning. I'll think about it.</text></string>

<string id="ways_info_way100a_text"><text>To the Commander of the Defense Cordon Troops\nReport\nI hereby report: On 14.04.2012 at 22:00 during evening roll call, the absence of three servicemen from my unit stationed at the former "Agrokompleks" Research Institute was discovered. During questioning of the rest, the following facts were revealed: the missing servicemen repeatedly, taking advantage of lack of control from junior command staff, visited local trader Sidorovich, who supplied them with alcoholic beverages and narcotics.\nAccording to their fellow servicemen, during patrol duty they discovered an unidentified passage to the Cordon through the "Forgotten Village" territory. The location and approach to this passage are provided on the attached map-diagram.\nMy undertaken measures to search for the missing servicemen have yielded no results.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way101a_text"><text>Information from the Guide:\nNot far beyond the former farm, there's a possibility to reach the "Agroprom" Research Institute through the Forgotten Village.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way102a_text"><text>The scientist in the bunker, in gratitude for the case provided to him, pointed out a completely unknown path from the former "Agroprom" Research Institute to the research laboratory at Yantar.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way103a_text"><text>According to documents stolen from the military base at the "Agroprom" Research Institute, the military planned to penetrate deep into the Zone through a newly opened path, one section of which passes through the X-16 research center, located near the scientists' bunker at Yantar.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way104a_text"><text>Few know that beyond the railway depot of the "Rostok" factory begins a road by which you can reach the eastern edge of the "Red Forest". But only seasoned stalkers or truly dark individuals dare to walk there. And even then - not alone.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way105a_text"><text>There is a passage from the Army Warehouses to the Red Forest. Probably, the military once used it. Now mercenaries have settled at the passage. Why - it's unclear.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way106a_text"><text>In the documents from the laboratory, a path was marked from the X-16 research complex, located at Yantar, to the Red Forest.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way107a_text"><text>The scientist at the Ivankovsky District Center indicated the entrance to laboratory X-12. Presumably there you can activate the "Rainbow" emitter.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way108a_text"><text>Documents found on scientists. A transition from Radar to the "Tesla" zone is indicated. Rather dubious due to its inaccessibility.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way109a_text"><text>At the former bandit base in Dark Valley, in the basement of the construction site, you can get to laboratory X-10.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way110a_text"><text>Barkeep reported about a path.\n\nInformation about a passage from Dark Valley to Foggy Thicket has been discovered. The passage was rarely used and few knew about it. Something strange is there in that thicket, which is why stalkers so reluctantly go there.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way111a_text"><text>Members of the "Freedom" faction have recently begun actively using a new route from their camp at the Warehouses to Foggy Thicket. Now it's become much easier for them to penetrate other parts of the Zone bypassing "Duty" outposts.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way112a_text"><text>You can pass from the Cordon to "the Gut". Who named this place like that - unclear. But apparently it reflects the essence in the eyes of other stalkers - little useful, narrow and full of all kinds of infection.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way113a_text"><text>According to stories, the tangle of anomalies blocking the path to the "Freedom" base is not so impassable after all. Apparently the Duty guys always knew this, they just hide it from stalkers, since there are "anarchists" from "Freedom" there. But someone still tells about the passage, since you can learn about it.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way114a_text"><text>Information about the passage location to Wild Territory has been obtained. Most likely this passage was always there, only an anomaly blocked it, but now it's clear that you can bypass it, so... Should we consider this a reward? Probably yes! In this world the absence of information is like death...</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way116a_text"><text>One of the first passages discovered by stalkers. This is also one of the most dangerous and at the same time frequently used paths. All stalkers use this passage, despite the dangers.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way117a_text"><text>One of the first passages discovered by stalkers. This is also one of the most dangerous and at the same time frequently used paths. All stalkers use this passage, despite the dangers.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way118a_text"><text>It turns out there is a passage between underground laboratories X-18 and X-16 from one to the other. This was to be expected, possibly even that all laboratories are connected to each other.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way130a_text"><text>The scientist at the Ivankovsky District Center told where the power supply console for the radar installations might be. It's somewhere in the laboratory under code X-12.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way135a_text"><text>You can exit from Foggy Thicket to the Garbage. The passage always existed, only few used it.</text></string>

And then, what's this strange idea that some single stalker, even if it's Strelok, could disrupt some "balance" of the entire ZONE... and the Zone supposedly grows because of him. What nonsense. Although, if you think about it... Many wonders hide behind the mists... Why did Strelok want to get to the Zone's center? Somewhere there should be a hint or explanation.</text></string>
<string id="ways_info_way181b_text"><text>From the Swamp there is a direct and simple path to Agroprom. Stalkers don't like to use this road because they are inhospitably met by the military at Agroprom. But for the soldiers it's a regular route.</text></string>

Very close from here he got caught in an anomaly, stayed alive, but the document wasn't with him. He can't move around yet, I'd go myself but I can't leave the rookies alone... Find the document, I'll get you an assault rifle. It's in the underground passage under the railway, straight north...\nAnd mind this, Marked One, my word here isn't the last one, refuse - it'll be hard for you to negotiate with the local folk...

<string id="marsh_tuzla_document"><text>Folder with scientific data.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_tuzla_document_desc"><text>Some fragmentary notes and reflections about the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_tuzla_document_text"><text>...So, about the intensity of the field. The fact that it changes, I don't even dispute; it's already visible from the measurement results. The point is how, by what law it changes. Is there periodicity, cyclicality or any kind of orderliness in these changes? If we can understand this, then we can possibly predict many other things - essentially we will approach some understanding of the Zone. So far, we've managed to predict an approaching emission with 51% probability. But an emission is a single and quite powerful surge; if we couldn't predict it with such probability, then we wouldn't be worth a penny at all. I'm talking about the general background level of the field and about islands with elevated levels...\n \n
 
 ...More on that later. I want to return to the possibility of predicting changes in the nature and intensity of the psi-field (you know, the term is quite conditional - a working name). Why is this so important? I'll try to explain. Here's what we typically deal with in the Zone: a) some sort of psi-field, b) anomalies, c) artifacts, d) monsters. At first glance, these all appear to be different things, but I believe they all belong to one category, but of a different order. Namely - all this can be referred to by one term: "anomalies". There is the Zone - a big anomaly, in it there is some field - an anomaly of the same order, but it does not go beyond the Zone's borders (although, no one has seriously considered this yet). Then there are actual anomalies - "Whirligig", "Carousel" and others, then there are artifacts born in these anomalies (so it's believed, at least), and finally monsters. I consider all of these to be different attributes of one anomaly...\n \n
 
 ...Perhaps all of this sounds confusing so far, but there must be feedback. I believe in this. Let's consider this again. So, the Zone (or something in it) generates a psi-field, which generates anomalies (this is conditional, maybe not the field itself, but its presence is mandatory), artifacts are born in anomalies, artifacts attract monsters. More or less. So what kind of feedback am I talking about? Here's what: if we were to remove all of the monsters, would artifacts show up? Why would they? Now let's remove artifacts - will anomalies be needed? Now, let's say, eliminate anomalies. Will this psi-field exist then? So, theoretically the Zone can be eliminated too. Yes, too far-fetched, I agree... But compared to the various silly theories about "superintelligence" and "contact", this one is no worse. Why not design experiments around this theory? Science often goes from experiment to theory. We can localize an area and gradually eliminate all monsters, collect and destroy all artifacts. This is within our power. And we'll see if the anomalies lose intensity? And we can even measure the intensity of the psi-field: what will happen to it after this? Will this somehow affect it? After all, there are already means of eliminating the anomalies themselves... So, now you understand what kind of experiment I'm talking about...\n \n
 
 ...Of course, we do not currently have the means nor resources for a large scale experiment of this nature. No one will undertake such an impossible task as destroying all monsters, zombies and artifacts, even within a confined area. But you can start small and conduct a local experiment with one specific anomaly. I'm talking about recently discovered so-called "variable" or "wandering" anomalies (this is again a working name). For example, I know that one can be found somewhere in the Radar territory, as well as in the "Tesla" zone. So, according to preliminary estimates, the intensity of such anomalies can change depending on whether some artifact is present nearby; that is, it is very "receptive" to this. Isn't this "feedback"? So far, we have gathered data that suggests such anomalies respond strongly to the "Pendulum" artifacts. But I suggest a pure experiment: we need to try different variants of artifacts and see how this anomaly responds to them; that is, if anomaly-artifact is a pair of symbionts, then the response will most likely be only to "Pendulums", but if it responds to other groups of artifacts too, then we can begin to draw conclusions about some sort of "feedback"...</text></string>

<string id="artmod_111_dialog_0"><text>Why are you hesitating, want to ask something?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_111_dialog_1"><text>Recently I met an experienced stalker, we shared a bottle with him, and he told me how you can get one artifact from another. From "Jellyfish" you can cook "Slime", can you imagine? For this you also need a tushkano head - I have that, a zombie hand - I traded for it, and a blind dog tail. That's the hard part. After my injury I'm not ready to chase dogs all over Cordon - it's hard. If you can bring me five tails, I'll share this method with you or give you some buckshot with medkits, not much, but I have a little stash.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_111_dialog_2"><text>That's all! Look how many of those mutts are running around.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_111_dialog_3"><text>Yeah, if only it was all so simple. This is the Zone. Hell knows what happens to these creatures. Either the dogs mutated, or their tails are weak by nature, and they later scrape them off somewhere in the bushes. You won't find a normal tail that's good for the job in every dog. That's why they're valuable.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_111_dialog_4"><text>I see, that's how it is. I'll keep that in mind.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_111_dialog_5"><text>Same problem with other creatures. Each has their own thing. For example, tushkano heads are valued, but getting one - that's a real problem! Seems like you shoot the body, but the head explodes! Some kind of pressure inside. Once I needed just one with a head, so I shot nearly all the tushkanos in Cordon before I got one like that.

<string id="artmod_132_dialog_42"><text>Better give medkits, I was running around...</text></string>
<string id="artmod_132_dialog_51"><text>The bandit said this: you need to throw "Jellyfish", "Thorn", a blind dog tail and a tushkano head into the "Whirligig" anomaly, what comes out is unknown, I didn't hear clearly, but something more useful - that's for sure!</text></string>
<string id="artmod_132_dialog_52"><text>Medkits, they're always needed.\nThank you for your help, Marked One. I didn't thank you right away, now I've got a little something - accept it from the heart...</text></string>
<string id="tex_esc_shustryi_medusa"><text>\nNimble wants to test the artifact modification method he heard from a bandit.\nFor this he needs the "Jellyfish" artifact</text></string>

<string id="artmod_141_dialog_0"><text>Bring vodka? How much?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_141_dialog_1"><text>I've got an "anniversary" coming up... A round date, so to speak. I want to celebrate it properly. We've got plenty of snacks, but booze, as always - not enough.\nSo I don't have to run to the dealer again, maybe you can bring me five bottles. I'll have a small strategic reserve. Then you'll have something to gain too:\neither ammo, or medicine, got good weapons.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_141_dialog_21"><text>It's no trouble for me. I'll just run to Sidor.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_141_dialog_22"><text>No-no-no, I'll be moving on.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_141_dialog_3"><text>Then I'll wait.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_142_dialog_0"><text>Congratulations on your anniversary, comrade major.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_142_dialog_1"><text>Don't shout, this ain't the parade ground. Did you bring it?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_142_dialog_21"><text>Five bottles, as we agreed.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_142_dialog_22"><text>Oh! Just a minute, I'll step away quickly.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_142_dialog_3"><text>You helped me out... I'll remember you. Take three packs of rounds and a couple medkits, as extra.\nIf you feel like it, come by, maybe we'll make another deal.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_142_dialog_4"><text>Thanks, can I pass through?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_142_dialog_5"><text>You can pass through. Just watch out! I'm warning all stalkers - there's a special operation planned in Dark Valley. Sent a group from our battalion there, for reconnaissance and such. My friend Seryoga Lemeshko commands them - we studied together at the academy. Don't go there - got it?\nIf you don't need anything else, then get out of here.</text></string>
<string id="tex_esc_bridge_vodka"><text>\nMajor Kuznetsov can provide Kalash rounds, medicine or weapons. For this he needs five bottles of vodka.</text></string>

<string id="fox_medkit_start_dialog_0"><text>What, always need medkits?</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_start_dialog_1"><text>Yeah, don't even mention it... Lately these blind dogs have mutated even more. A tiny scratch is enough - and you're done. So you have to disinfect immediately and cut out a whole chunk of infected flesh.\nIf you agree, I'll give you a recipe for ten medkits. Or something else valuable.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_start_dialog_21"><text>I'll try to gather that many.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_start_dialog_22"><text>Sorry, Fox, I need to keep moving.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_start_dialog_3"><text>Thanks, friend. I'll be waiting.</text></string>

<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_0"><text>Fox, I brought you 10 medkits as promised.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_1"><text>Oh! Just in time. At least I'll recover a bit.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_21"><text>Here you go, get well.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_22"><text>Where did I put them? Did I drop them...</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_3"><text>Thanks for the help! I can give you a recipe for how to get "Fireball" from "Electra". Ah, no, actually I have the "Ball" itself. What will you take? If neither interests you, I can give you my old rifle. Though it needs cleaning and oiling, I stashed it a couple months ago when I got a better gun. It's been lying there all this time, but at least nobody stole it - checked it right before my last trip.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_41"><text>Give me the recipe, I'll cook the "Ball" myself.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_42"><text>Forget that cooking stuff. Give me the artifact.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_43"><text>My gear is pretty mediocre right now, so your little rifle would come in handy, if it's good.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_51"><text>I uploaded the recipe to your PDA.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_52"><text>That's right. An artifact is more reliable.</text></string>
<string id="fox_medkit_done_dialog_53"><text>Good one. Saved me more than once. For long trips it's inconvenient to carry, but here, near the Zone borders - it's perfect!\nGive me your PDA, I'll mark where to look for my stash with the rifle. Just keep in mind that these handhelds glitch sometimes. Happens that marks fall off the map. So try to at least roughly remember the important places.</text></string>
<string id="tex_esc_fox_medkit"><text>\nFox needs medkits, no less than 10 pieces.</text></string>

<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_0"><text>What kind of special gun did you mention? Where to find it?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_1"><text>The stalker I went to the Bar with had a homemade submachine gun. Some craftsman built it for regular PM pistol rounds. Good round - expensive, but Soviet nine-millimeters... there's tons of them. And they're cheap. We came back from the Bar together, I wouldn't have gone alone. So I wasn't slacking, would've paid my debt next time.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_2"><text>You're suggesting I take this homemade contraption from him?! Or am I missing something...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_3"><text>No need to take anything from him. Here, in Garbage, across from the hangar, there's an old railway tunnel. That guy went in there for an artifact and never came back. Maybe died, and is still lying there.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_4"><text>So go there yourself then. It's right nearby.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_5"><text>After those troubles, my knees are still shaking. And going unarmed... Even though it's close, it's kinda scary somehow.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_51"><text>In the tunnel, you say? Alright... but I'm not promising anything.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_52"><text>Yeah, you're just one big walking trouble yourself. Crawl into your tunnel yourself.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_start_dialog_6"><text>You try your best, I've got something to thank you with.</text></string>
<string id="tex_gar_dram_novice_mp5_m1"><text>\nYurik, a novice from Garbage, asks to find a homemade submachine gun.\nAccording to him, the stalker with this weapon died in the tunnel across from the hangar</text></string>

<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_1"><text>Come on! About the unusual weapon that stalker had who went into the tunnel. Don't you remember?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_21"><text>Found your gun, tested it, nice little machine. Here you go...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_22"><text>Haven't found your wonder-weapon yet, be patient...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_3"><text>Yeah, with this thing I'm the king of Garbage! Can't feed you with thanks, let me upload a recipe to your PDA... or give you some ammo? I stashed a little bit...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_41"><text>I'm interested in recipes.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_42"><text>I'd rather have ammo.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_51"><text>You'll cook a good artifact, use it.\nListen, Marked One, can I ask you for something else?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_mp5_done_dialog_52"><text>Left of the road, there's an old bulldozer. Near it in a hollow there's a rusty pipe. I dumped some armor-piercing rounds there when I was running from those bastards. Use them.\nListen, Marked One, can I ask you for something else?</text></string>

<string id="yurik_burer_hand_start_dialog_0"><text>What a day... Everyone needs something. Alright, speak up...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_start_dialog_1"><text>I just left Cordon recently, don't know how to do anything... Decided to prove to everyone that I'm worth something... But got unlucky, ran into bandits right away. It's shameful to return empty-handed, they'll laugh... If I had a part of some legendary monster... Burer paw, chimera claw, bloodsucker tentacles... or controller hand. Then I wouldn't have to hide my eyes in shame when I return to camp at Cordon. Maybe you'll find some?\nAnd I'll tell you about an unusual artifact... well... actually, I only heard about it by accident... maybe I didn't hear everything properly.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_start_dialog_21"><text>What demands you have, Yurik! If I get the chance, I'll bring it, but I'm not promising anything.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_start_dialog_22"><text>Sorry, Yurik, you'll never become a real stalker this way. Get it yourself.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_start_dialog_3"><text>Please try your best, Marked One. Otherwise I don't know how to return to camp.</text></string>

<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_0"><text>So, Yurochka, need more monster parts?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_1"><text>Yes! Of course! Do you have any?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_21"><text>Catch the paw, great hunter...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_22"><text>Here's bloodsucker tentacles, take them...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_23"><text>Here's a chimera claw, you can brag about it...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_24"><text>Controller hand, serious beast.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_25"><text>Uh-uh-uh... Don't have any!</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_3"><text>Ah, now I'll walk around camp with a proud look, tell stories... About you, of course.\nYeah, about the artifact - I heard bandits talking to each other... Here, very close by, in a little forest behind the swamp, there's an old log. One of the brothers stuck some unusual artifact in there. Then zombies wandered in there, and dogs with tushkanos made a den nearby. That's why the bandits were afraid to go back to that place to get the artifact. They kept arguing about who would go. So it's probably still lying there...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_burer_hand_done_dialog_4"><text>Watch it, Yurochka, if you lied...</text></string>

<string id="luber_medicine_start_dialog_1"><text>In a way. Heard you took on treating our "old man" - Prapor, do us a favor too.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_start_dialog_2"><text>You'd better not sit by the fire all day long, get off your ass and shoot some dogs and boars yourself... or whose tails and tentacles are you planning to treat each other with. By the way, where exactly are you going to apply them? Heh-heh.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_start_dialog_3"><text>You misunderstood. I don't need monster parts. We're more inclined toward folk medicine. There's this healer at the Swamps - Boryan. He collects all kinds of medicinal herbs, makes tinctures and decoctions. Could you get three herb packets from him, the ones for stomach troubles? The food here gives us the runs often, might find us with bare asses under a bush someday. I can't leave myself, we're waiting for orders, going on a raid soon.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_start_dialog_41"><text>Deal, I was heading that way anyway. But you'll owe me, keep that in mind. By the way, have you tried eating less junk?</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_start_dialog_42"><text>Switch to crackers and water, it'll ease up.</text></string>

<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_1"><text>What happened to them? Someone got fever or something worse?</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_2"><text>Frequent stomach troubles from the food there. Diarrhea's been killing them.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_3"><text>They shouldn't shove all kinds of junk in their mouths. I told Prapor long ago that "diversifying the menu" won't end well.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_4"><text>That's understandable... Need three herb packets. The guys are preparing for a raid, they need to get treated.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_5"><text>Then let's do this. Go to Pakhom, the supply guy at the scientists' base, and get six empty jars from him. Fill them with substance from the "Fruit Punch" anomaly, bring them to me. I'll have the preparations ready by then.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_start_dlg_6"><text>Maybe the guys should just go on a diet, that might help?</text></string>

<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_done_dlg_2"><text>Take them, didn't break any.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_boryan_done_dlg_3"><text>And here are the herbs for you. I wrote how and what to brew on a piece of paper. Put it inside so it doesn't get lost. And take some medicine, the road's not short, you never know.</text></string>

<string id="luber_medicine_done_dialog_2"><text>Take your herbs, what and how to brew is written on the paper inside.</text></string>
<string id="luber_medicine_done_dialog_3"><text>Now we'll fix the digestion and can go on the raid. How should I thank you? I can give you a recipe for getting "Soul" artifact.

<string id="neumeha_container_1_dialog_1"><text>You'd be wrinkled up here too! Leg won't bend, knee's swollen. Terrible pain. And the Doctor disappeared somewhere.\nDamn.

<string id="neumeha_container_1_dialog_2"><text>You mean Swamp Doctor? He's not that far - across the bridge in a shack.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_1_dialog_3"><text>Really?! Listen, friend, help me out. I'll sell you a couple grenades cheap. It's nothing for you to run to the Doctor, right? Tell him Kostik, nicknamed Butterfingers, asks for that ointment he gave before. He won't go unpaid, meaning I won't!</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_1_dialog_4"><text>Hmm. Won't run there specially, but if I meet him - I'll pass your request. By the way, why Butterfingers? You don't seem like a newbie in the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_container_1_dialog_5"><text>Well... When I came here, I couldn't do almost anything. Couldn't make a fire, couldn't shoot, couldn't butcher a boar. I'm from the city. So the nickname stuck. And once it sticks - that's it, nobody remembers anything else. That's how it went. You too, now nobody will call you anything else - Marked One and that's it. Many carry nicknames that tell about their past...</text></string>

<string id="neumeha_container_2_dialog_1"><text>Bad, damn... Haven't seen the Doctor?</text></string>

<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_1"><text>I don't want any.\nListen, Marked One, I heard you were at Agroprom, right?\nA stalker whispered to me that somewhere in the eastern block of the institute, some specialist stashed an unusual armor. Very durable, like steel.\nI'd love to have one like that. In my rags, I'm afraid to even stick my nose out past the Cordon. Vergas says my jacket is only good for rags. I don't have money, and Sidorovich doesn't want to give credit because of that container incident.\nYou've already helped me out big time, I understand everything, but still... Won't you agree to look for that suit for me?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_2"><text>Wow, that's something! Let me have some water, 'cause I'm so hungry there's no place to spend the night - just your case.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_3"><text>Not at all! You misunderstood me, I'm not asking for a freebie. I'll share a good recipe in gratitude or pay with ammo - recently found a canister of alcohol behind the factory, hidden in the bushes, so I traded it with the military for a box of grenades.\nOh, and if my offer suits you and you manage to find the armor, there's one small request: please check that it's in good condition. I'm broke, as I said already. Can't afford repair costs if something happens. So, deal?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_41"><text>Alright, you convinced me. I think I'll end up in those parts more than once, so I'll take a look when I get the chance, see if your armor is there.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_42"><text>No, Kostik, the game's not worth the candle, as they say. And they probably told you bullshit, and you fell for it hook, line and sinker.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_51"><text>Excellent! I knew from the moment we met that you're a stand-up guy, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_start_dlg_52"><text>To be honest, I didn't really believe it myself. Well... not meant to be, I guess.</text></string>

<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_0"><text>Remember we talked about that sturdy armor?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_1"><text>Yeah... What about it?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_21"><text>Found it. Here you go.</text></string>

<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_31"><text>Holy shit, Marked One! I didn't believe it. How can I thank you? I know a recipe for getting Stone Blood from Sparkler. Interested? Or want me to give you five F-1 grenades?</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_32"><text>Too bad you changed your mind. Don't even know who else to turn to...</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_41"><text>Let's see what we can get from Sparkler.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_42"><text>Grenades are somehow more convenient than a recipe.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_51"><text>Then I'll upload it to your PDA, and you can figure it out from there.</text></string>
<string id="neumeha_outfit_done_dlg_52"><text>Yeah, I think so too. Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="tex_neumeha_outfit"><text>\nButterfingers heard that someone hid an exceptionally durable stalker suit at Agroprom. He needs just such a suit to start making long-distance trips. Since he doesn't have money for possible repairs, he asks to check that the armor is in good condition. In return, he promises to share a valuable recipe or ammunition. However, you can always keep the find for yourself.</text></string>

The guys are laughing, but I'm not in the mood for jokes. An old stalker passed by recently - they call him Guide - haven't you met him? So he advised me. Make a tincture, he says, from flesh eyes, it'll take the pain away like magic. You bring me three... mmm, no, better make it four eyes, and I'll find something to thank you with.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_start_dialog_21"><text>Flesh eyes? Alright, I'll get them.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_eyes_done_dialog_41"><text>Give me the recipe, let's see what comes out.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_eyes_done_dialog_42"><text>Grenades are needed, just have the right place to use them.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_jaws_start_dialog_1"><text>Hell knows. Maybe I need to drink something else. Bullet came by recently, he says there's an ointment that helps great. And it's made from bloodsucker tentacles. Maybe you'll take it on? Get a couple pieces, for testing? Then I'll share a recipe with you for how to get Flash from Sparkler, or I'll throw in some antirad, got a bit stocked up.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_jaws_start_dialog_3"><text>Try it, or I'll have no strength left with this disease.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_jaws_done_dialog_0"><text>How are you? I see you're in fighting shape.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_jaws_done_dialog_1"><text>Only hope is in you, in that miraculous ointment.</text></string>

Knowledgeable people say that a belt made from pseudodog tails is the best way. Either radiation accumulates in them, or something else, but they warm you to the bone...

There's one option.\nWhen we last bailed out those wimp scientists in Dark Valley, I found an unusual artifact.

I dropped the artifact, can't really run with such a thing.\nSince then, I can't get this damn thing out of my head, even dream about it at night. Maybe you'll find it and bring it?

Should be lying somewhere there, under the bridge.</text></string>

The fog was so thick you could cut it with an axe. That's when blind dogs and fleshes jumped us, and then cats showed up too. Had to run.

From informed people there's information that a group of young scientists, those who work for the military, conducted experiments with the Cobblestone artifact, researched the applicability of its anti-gravity properties. The work wasn't finished, they were lured to America. But they managed to make two experimental suits with anti-gravity effect. As usual with the military, nobody remembered these suits, threw them away and forgot. Will you take on getting them? Just let's do it this way - if you take it on, I need an artifact from you for the tip. Second level.

<string id="artmod_411_dialog_21"><text>Alright, here's your artifact. And where exactly?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_411_dialog_22"><text>Don't feel like dealing with the military... Need to think about it.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_411_dialog_31"><text>Heh-heh... In Karaganda... Sidorovich was chatting that they left them at the checkpoint, at the Cordon. A soldier there told him that something similar was lying around in the barracks attic. If, of course, nobody grabbed them yet. I've got a scheme here, how to safely approach the checkpoint if needed. Here, take it.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_411_dialog_32"><text>Think faster, or I'll offer it to someone else.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_412_dialog_0"><text>Found those gravity suits from the soldiers...</text></string>

<string id="artmod_412_dialog_21"><text>Let you lift almost two hundred kilos, but they're heavy themselves... Take them.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_412_dialog_22"><text>What do they do? A lot of things! I'll keep them for myself.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_412_dialog_31"><text>Holy shit! I'll sell them to one guy, he was very interested. So what do you want - should I give you the recipe or can I hook you up with an excellent artifact, completely green?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_412_dialog_41"><text>Give me the recipe, I'm interested in them.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_412_dialog_42"><text>I'll take the artifact.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_gravibronik_dialog_2"><text>Bootlegger hinted that some soldier from the checkpoint told you about some unique suits. That they're lying around unattended somewhere.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_gravibronik_dialog_31"><text>Maybe he did tell me. What's it to you about these suits?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_gravibronik_dialog_32"><text>Bootlegger came to his senses! Those suits are long gone.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_gravibronik_dialog_4"><text>I promised Bootlegger to get them. But, you understand, doing it quietly is complicated, and I don't want to go to war with the checkpoint.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_gravibronik_dialog_5"><text>You made the right decision. Messing with soldiers - costs you more, and me too. There's an option to resolve this quietly. At night a soldier comes out to the concrete slabs. Runs a little business with stalkers for vodka. You could approach him, ask around, maybe find something out. You can also take some vodka from me... for a more candid conversation. Heh-heh.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_422_dialog_53"><text>You're thinking right, friend. I'm sure it'll serve you well.\nWell then. Now let's spread the word, this scum is already stuck in many people's throats. If we gather enough decent guys, we'll try to crush this Borov's viper nest.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_422_dialog_6"><text>Thanks for the hookup, but I doubt anyone will respond to your call. Same story was at Garbage...</text></string>
<string id="tex_val_pula_ammo"><text>Bullet asks to bring ammunition from the caravan to Bes, commander of the neutral squad from Garbage (he went to Dark Valley, it seems). Ammunition should be looked for in the ravine behind the gas station</text></string>

<string id="luber_pda_start_dlg_0"><text>So what are you still doing here? You were going to lead the squad to the Valley.</text></string>
<string id="luber_pda_start_dlg_1"><text>We're low on ammo. Bandits took my PDA, and it has coordinates to an ammunition stash recorded. The data is encrypted, so I think these scumbags won't understand what it is. I managed to turn on the marker, if there's a chance, try to track it. Docent at the Bar can find it. Then we'll have a chance to destroy this snake nest. And you'll get some benefit too.</text></string>
<string id="luber_pda_start_dlg_21"><text>Interesting information. Well, I'll try.</text></string>
<string id="luber_pda_start_dlg_22"><text>I need to look for the laboratory.</text></string>
<string id="luber_pda_start_dlg_3"><text>I'm counting on you.</text></string>

<string id="luber_pda_done_dlg_0"><text>I found your PDA.</text></string>
<string id="luber_pda_done_dlg_1"><text>Excellent, now we can start gathering the squad. Is the information undamaged?</text></string>
<string id="luber_pda_done_dlg_21"><text>See for yourself.</text></string>
<string id="luber_pda_done_dlg_22"><text>Well, your computer is trashed, crushed.</text></string>
<string id="luber_pda_done_dlg_3"><text>So... Everything seems to be fine! Yeah, and there are coordinates. I think you have the right to know about this too.\nIn Foggy Thicket mercenaries abandoned several boxes. They seemed to want to make a transit warehouse there or there was an order from someone - not exactly known. But strange things are happening there, so their nerves couldn't take it - they bolted in a hurry. According to our data, here it is, near the old quarry. When you're there, you can use it, if there's still something there of course...</text></string>
<string id="tex_val_escort_PDA"><text>Return Max Luber's PDA.\nThis PDA contains encrypted information about the location where ammunition is hidden. The bandit with this PDA could be anywhere. Better ask the smart guy from the Bar - Docent - to track the marker signal</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_0"><text>I wouldn't mind earning some money. Got any jobs?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_1"><text>I don't know about earnings, but I got hooked up with a new recipe. Specifically, how to get "Gravi" from "Wrenched". You're interested, right?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_21"><text>Well, let's discuss it.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_22"><text>Sorry, right now I'm not interested in this. Some other time.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_31"><text>Heard about Fang? What a master craftsman he was.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_32"><text>There's information that someone got unusual weapon. A prototype, experimental sample, made, according to rumors, by Fang himself as a unique piece. How this person got it - I don't know. And it's not really important. Maybe Fang personally gave it, or he stole it, or found something lost.\nThey gave me a tip where this weapon was later hidden by its new owner. Maybe it's bullshit, but... Will you check? In Dark Valley, to the left of the factory gates, there's a trailer, with an iron structure. Somewhere there it's worth looking for a backpack.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_4"><text>Let's say. But why was?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_42"><text>Got it. I'll try to find it.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_5"><text>But he died. Long ago it seems. At least, those are the rumors going around.\nAlright, to business. There's information that Fang made some unusual weapon to order. An experimental sample, a prototype, if you will. We should try to find this wunderwaffe. As far as I know, it exists as a unique piece, but surely from this sample we could churn out as many as we want.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_6"><text>How to find it? Where? Ask Fang, who, by your own words, died long ago? Or do you suggest plowing through the entire Zone with your nose? Where did you even learn about this weapon?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_7"><text>Fang used to show up at Bar from time to time. He was looking for various parts, asking Docent, asking Barkeep. He showed them drawings, blueprints, explained what exactly he needed. During his last appearance, he mentioned to our Prapor that he managed to assemble a new weapon. It shoots like hell, but still needs serious refinement. Like a demonstration model. At that moment he wasn't planning to hand this gun over to the client, which means he must have stashed it somewhere.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_8"><text>Prapor knows Fang well, or what? Maybe he knows about his stashes too?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_9"><text>No, he doesn't. In the Zone, it happens that a person seems to have many acquaintances and buddies. But only until it comes to loot. So, nobody tries to blab too much even to seemingly the best friends. Prapor is here, somewhere in Bar. You should ask him about Fang yourself.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_10"><text>He seemed like a rather grim and unfriendly type to me. I doubt I'll be able to get anything out of him.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_11"><text>At least try. If you can't find out what you need directly, then go the roundabout way: through connections and contacts, places he used to frequent, and so on...\nYou're looking for Strelok, and Fang, by the way, was one of his subordinates. This could also be a thread for the search. Extra motivation for you, and assurance for me that you won't forget about this assignment.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_12"><text>Hmm... In my opinion, in this light your assignment is worth more than just one recipe. Something more substantial.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_13"><text>You haven't even started yet, and you're already bargaining. We'll see. If I only get information from you, then don't expect more from me. But if you get the weapon, I guarantee a bonus. I'm not going to pressure you or rush you, but while wandering around the Zone, keep in mind that Petrenko asked you about something.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_start_dlg_14"><text>Alright then. I'll keep it in mind.</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_done_dlg_0"><text>Greetings! I got the gun we talked about!</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_done_dlg_1"><text>So you found it... Complications?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_done_dlg_2"><text>None really, except that... had to do some running.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_gaussgan_done_dlg_3"><text>Well then. Duty won't remain in debt. Here, take this detector, an improved model. It identifies almost all types of anomalies, even that damn "Witch's Jelly". It's not mass-produced, there are only a few of these in the Zone. Don't even ask where I got it from.\nYes, and that's not all! Give me your communication code, I'll send you an artifact transformation method...</text></string>
<string id="tex_bar_dolg_petrenko_gaussgan"><text>\nThere is information that Fang made an unusual weapon. Petrenko asks to find it and bring it to him.</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_start_dlg_0"><text>Messages have been circulating on the net that you might have work for a stalker.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_start_dlg_1"><text>It happens... sometimes. I want to test one theory. I learned a new recipe, but haven't tried it yet. You can get "Moonlight" from "Flash". Only I don't have "Flash". Bring me two artifacts right away, in case something goes wrong, and I'll either share the recipe with you or throw in some grenades for the underbarrel launcher.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_start_dlg_21"><text>There are plenty of these "Flash" artifacts, I'll bring them right now.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_start_dlg_22"><text>Sorry, some other time.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_start_dlg_3"><text>Plenty like dirt, you say? Yeah, right. Anyway, I'm waiting for two artifacts from you.</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_done_dlg_0"><text>About the "Flash" artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_done_dlg_1"><text>Found them?! You're fast as diarrhea. That's a joke. I didn't think anyone would be ready to give up artifacts for a trivial set of words.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_done_dlg_21"><text>Take them already, joker.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_done_dlg_22"><text>Hmm... Indeed. Then I'll keep them for myself.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_done_dlg_3"><text>So what do you want - should I send you the recipe or give you grenades.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_done_dlg_41"><text>I need the recipe. It's interesting to see what will come out.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_done_dlg_42"><text>I'll take the grenades, they're more reliable.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_done_dlg_51"><text>Then write down the recipe.\nFor your speed - you get a bonus. Write it down or just remember: you can get a rare artifact from an ordinary "Pellicle", for this you need to throw it into "Snow", and "Ruby Pellicle" allows you to remove a "Springboard" anomaly from your path.\nSince you're so responsible, maybe we can pull off one more job? Come back in a bit. We'll talk.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_electra_flash_done_dlg_52"><text>Grenades, so grenades... take some RGDs too. I always have plenty of them, as you put it - "like dirt". Open your backpack.\nAnd for your speed - you get a bonus.

<string id="artmod_643_dialog_0"><text>Hey there, tough mug... Got a good artifact for ya here.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_643_dialog_1"><text>Where from? What kind of artifact?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_643_dialog_2"><text>One scientist from Yantar handed it over, says you're in the know</text></string>
<string id="artmod_643_dialog_3"><text>Ahhh... That one... Take it, here's his payment. Scientists are the same profiteers as everyone else.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_541_dialog_0"><text>Yeah right! I already went to that underground place, and you...</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_1"><text>Our job isn't to run around in underground places. We work more with our heads.\nMarked One, did you see a decoder in the laboratory?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_2"><text>What decoder?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_3"><text>Sakharov gave Ghost a new model of transdecoder with triangulation function of disturbing influence of variable-wave gradient of psi-influence...</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_4"><text>What?! Did you even understand what you just said?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_5"><text>In general, a small box with numbers, when Ghost last made contact, he said he was near the main shutdown console. Take a look there, if you bring it, I'll share with you a recipe for transforming "Gravi" into "Goldfish".</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_6"><text>You're suggesting I do measurements again and look for artifacts just for this? No way!</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_7"><text>No measurements needed anymore. There's no radiation there now... well, almost none - a safe level for health. Professor says the modulation has changed, and in this phase it will take at least several days before the radiation becomes deadly again. And what do artifacts have to do with it? You got out somehow, surely there are other entrances and exits there.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_8"><text>Why didn't you say right away that such a safe modulation could happen? Maybe I didn't need to measure anything then?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_9"><text>You were clicking switches there yourself - that's what changed something! And if you hadn't made the measurements, you wouldn't have been able to get inside. Listen, what's the difference now, I'm telling you - it's not dangerous there for now, but how long it will stay that way is unclear. So what?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_10"><text>About the little device? What does it at least look like?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_11"><text>A small box like that. I don't need the device itself as much as the flash card that's in it. The device too, of course, but all the information is recorded on the card.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_12"><text>What did you say - flash card? You reminded me of something. What do you think, can you read what's recorded on a flash drive if it's been lying around somewhere for a very long time? Doesn't part of the information get erased?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_13"><text>Probably, what could happen to it? So will you go and look for it?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_541_dialog_14"><text>Maybe it's clean there now. I'll try to enter from another way somehow.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_542_dialog_0"><text>I found your little device. This one?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_542_dialog_1"><text>Yes, that's the one!</text></string>
<string id="artmod_542_dialog_2"><text>Take it.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_542_dialog_3"><text>Thanks from all our science. You want the recipe or what?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_542_dialog_41"><text>Tell me, let's see the result.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_542_dialog_42"><text>I'd rather take the artifact itself than mess around with this witchcraft.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_542_dialog_51"><text>Write down the recipe.\nThere's one more thing... won't you take a walk to Sidorovich?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_542_dialog_52"><text>The artifact is so-so, of course. Take some special medical kits too. Stalkers value them!\nThere's one more thing... won't you take a walk to Sidorovich?</text></string>
<string id="tex_yan_kruglov_decoder"><text>\nSemyonov is looking for a lost decoder. According to him, the decoder might be located in laboratory X-16 near the main control console</text></string>

<string id="artmod_641_dialog_0"><text>To Sidorovich? Why?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_641_dialog_1"><text>I understand you're not much of a talker. You see, I'm sitting on a bare salary. Sakharov doesn't spoil us much. But recently I found an artifact with unusual properties. I contacted Sidorovich, he agreed to pay a tidy sum. I need to deliver a container with the artifact to him, and get payment from him for me. It's become known around the Zone that you're not greedy for money, more interested in unusual things, so I'll show you a recipe on how to cook "Kolobok".</text></string>
<string id="artmod_641_dialog_21"><text>Alright, I'll support our native science.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_641_dialog_22"><text>Nah, guys, handle your own little business yourselves.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_641_dialog_3"><text>Then it's a deal. Safe travels.</text></string>

<string id="artmod_642_dialog_0"><text>Hello... businessman.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_642_dialog_1"><text>Well, how did it go? Everything alright?</text></string>
<string id="artmod_642_dialog_2"><text>Fine, here's your money.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_642_dialog_3"><text>Thanks, if you need anything, always feel free to ask. You want the recipe or will you take the artifact? I have one, though it's slightly spoiled.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_642_dialog_41"><text>Tell me the recipe. I'll cook a fresh one.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_642_dialog_42"><text>Just give me what you have.</text></string>
<string id="artmod_642_dialog_51"><text>Then write it down and take some medicine.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_x18docs_start_0"><text>Professor, it's written all over your face that you want to ask me about something. Spit it out already.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_start_1"><text>Yes-yes, I was just about to... As I understand it, you managed to visit the underground laboratory indexed X-18, didn't you?\nCould you go down there again and thoroughly examine everything for any documentation? As far as I know, several attempts were made to evacuate equipment and documents from that place. Therefore, surely everything valuable was prepared for evacuation and packed in some boxes or crates. Those are what you should definitely check.\nThe more papers you bring, the more substantial the reward will be. If something particularly valuable turns up among what you deliver, I promise an additional bonus from me personally. How do these terms sound to you? Will you take it on?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_start_21"><text>Well... I'll try, but I'm not promising anything.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_start_22"><text>Sorry, but I don't have time to deal with this right now.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_0"><text>I'm here about the documents from laboratory X-18.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_1"><text>Well, speak up. Did you manage to find anything?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_21"><text>I did. Take it. This is what I found.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_22"><text>I'll probably take another look later. Haven't examined everything thoroughly yet.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_3"><text>Alright, let's take a look. First I'll credit your account, just a minute...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_4"><text>That's nice, thanks. But what's in the documents, professor? I'm curious myself.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_510"><text>Now let me see... Guard log... Accounting statements... Work orders...\nNothing interesting so far. Pity. I was hoping for more. Maybe you could try searching better?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_511"><text>Yeah, damn it... Fine. I'll make another attempt.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_512"><text>No, professor. I don't want to deal with this anymore.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_513"><text>Unfortunate. Well then... we'll have to ask someone else.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_x18docs_done_520"><text>Now let me see... Guard log... Accounting statements... Work orders...\nAnd what's this? Experiment reports... Aha! What I was looking for! That is, I mean to say... We're incredibly lucky! I didn't even hope to get my hands on... Ahem, well, never mind.\nMarked One, you've certainly earned additional reward! Please, accept this as a sign of my deepest gratitude and also... copy into your PDA a method for obtaining a most curious artifact with the working name "Medusa Gorgona". Do you know what its specialty is? You've surely encountered mutants in the Zone that are commonly called just cats here? Haven't you wondered how they manage to induce drowsiness in people? It's not really their purring. The sounds they make merely help tune their brain biorhythms for psi-wave attack... However, let me skip the unnecessary details and get to the point: this artifact blocks the psi-activity of these creatures. In my opinion, quite a useful property for stalker trade.</text></string>
<string id="tex_yan_scientist_books"><text>\nSakharov asks to revisit laboratory X-18 in search of any documents not evacuated from there during the evacuation. You should search in boxes or crates. The more you manage to find, the higher the reward will be.</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_exo_yan_start_dlg_0"><text>Depends on what kind of job.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_exo_yan_start_dlg_1"><text>Need to deliver something to Yantar.\nSakharov has several exoskeletons, I arranged with him to trade a couple for a rare artifact. The artifact is in a heavy protective container. Will you take it on?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_exo_yan_start_dlg_21"><text>Not far, in principle, I'll make the trip.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_exo_yan_start_dlg_22"><text>Not now, find another courier.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_exo_yan_start_dlg_3"><text>Take the container. That's it, you're free to go.</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_exo_yan_done_dlg_0"><text>Yes, I'm just back from Sakharov.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_exo_yan_done_dlg_1"><text>And where are the exoskeletons?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_exo_yan_done_dlg_21"><text>Here, barely managed to carry them.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_exo_yan_done_dlg_22"><text>Couldn't drag both at once, wait a bit, they'll be here soon.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_exo_yan_done_dlg_3"><text>On behalf of Duty, I express my gratitude to you, Marked One. You'll be recommended for commendation.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_exo_yan_dialog_0"><text>Good evening, professor, I'm here by arrangement with Petrenko.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_exo_yan_dialog_1"><text>Mm... unusual artifact, right?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_exo_yan_dialog_2"><text>Exactly. Petrenko says there haven't been any like this before.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_exo_yan_dialog_3"><text>Yes, judging by the description - a small sensation! I promised him new exoskeletons for his brotherhood, take them. Their power system isn't activated, but Petrenko knows how and what to connect.</text></string>

<string id="playboy_start_dialog_0"><text>Hello there, soldier, why are you frowning?</text></string>
<string id="playboy_start_dialog_1"><text>Listen, you travel around a lot, maybe you'll find me one thing?</text></string>
<string id="playboy_start_dialog_2"><text>What thing? And what's in it for me?</text></string>
<string id="playboy_start_dialog_31"><text>I know about a good stash at Garbage. If we make a deal, I'll describe where it is. Or I can swap your vest for a normal, military one. The one you have on, you'd only take hunting... And even then, not for every "beast". But it can be put to use.\nAnd the thing... I need a magazine, "Playboy". Don't think it's because of the chicks... There's just one recipe written in there, I really need it. The other day I sat with Baldy, got a little tired from vodka, it happens. I woke up in the morning, and the magazine was gone... I only remember that I was praising the chicks from there to the whole Bar. Someone must have swiped it... for pleasure, I guess. There are three charming brunettes on the cover. So what do you say?</text></string>

<string id="playboy_done_dialog_32"><text>Yes, they are, my beauties... Wow, what lookers! Remind me, how did we agree on the reward?</text></string>
<string id="playboy_done_dialog_41"><text>The vest. With mine, you're right, it gets tough in serious fights. I'll swap.</text></string>
<string id="playboy_done_dialog_42"><text>Stash at Garbage. Tell me about it.</text></string>
<string id="playboy_done_dialog_51"><text>So here's the deal. We were having a heart-to-heart with one soldier and he let slip that he knows where there's a good cache at Garbage. The place is problematic, so the soldier himself didn't dare go there. But the tip is solid, he got it from an experienced stalker.

<string id="resiept_activ_anom_info_text"><text>\n\nThanks to conducted experiments, the following pattern has been established: if you place a "Sparkler" artifact with absolutely positive characteristics into a "Snow" anomaly (this name is common among stalkers, there is no established scientific definition yet), then this artifact transforms into a new one with completely unique properties! The working name - "Snow" - is given as a reference to the anomaly participating in the transformation process. With sequential presses and touches to specific areas on the artifact's surface (see diagram on the back), there is a release of energy accumulated by the object, as a result of which a %c[UI_orange]"Whirligig" anomaly appears at the location where the artifact was activated!\n%c[default]At the same time, "Snow" completely loses its physical shell, turning into chaotic low-intensity radiation. The mechanism of this phenomenon is actively being studied.</text></string>

<string id="teleport_01_dialog_3"><text>Sorry, professor, I can't right now...</text></string>
<string id="tex_yan_scientist_teleport_01"><text>Professor Sakharov asked to install the device at Army Warehouses, in the village, on the water tower</text></string>

<string id="teleport_01_2dialog_0"><text>I installed the device you gave me. Is everything alright?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_01_2dialog_1"><text>Yes-yes. The signal is quite stable. Based on the data that the device transmits, it seems possible for me to configure the "Compass". If there's a need and you don't mind such a rare artifact - you're welcome.\nWe're still studying the materials we receive from there, and based on the results, it will become clear whether tuning to longer distances is possible.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_01_2dialog_11"><text>Hmm... Strange. We're not receiving a signal. Did you definitely install the device? There, where needed? Please check once more if it's working.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_01_2dialog_21"><text>Uh... I'll check when I get a chance.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_01_2dialog_2"><text>How long will you be researching?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_01_2dialog_3"><text>I can't say exactly, come back later. For now that's all, thank you.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_01_2dialog_4"><text>So... I carried 20 kilos on my back for a "thank you"? Professor, that's not how business is done...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_01_2dialog_5"><text>Ah, yes! You're expecting some reward for your labor.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_01_2dialog_6"><text>Yes, I'd like that.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_01_2dialog_7"><text>What to give you... You seemed interested in recipes? Write down the recipe for the so-called "Crystal".</text></string>
<string id="teleport_01_2dialog_8"><text>That's good too... though, I think I already wrote down one like that. Or maybe I'm confusing...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_01_2dialog_9"><text>Well, that's what there is for now, nothing else.</text></string>

<string id="teleport_02_dialog_0"><text>Have you already studied the data from the device at the Warehouses?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_02_dialog_1"><text>Disturbance gradient fluctuations are within acceptable error, correlation shows that even more distant territories are conditionally accessible...\nIf you're ready to continue these experiments, let's try a longer distance, say, practically to the Zone's perimeter. It would be interesting to know how much the fluctuation deviations of continuum convolution increase in the distance gradient from the epicenter of disturbing anomalous activity. You, I think, have been to the border? As stalkers say, at Cordon? Try to install the device at the highest point of this area. As our available footage shows, this is the railway bridge. On the upper structures, I think it will be fine. Will you take it?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_02_dialog_2"><text>Alright. Give me your device...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_02_dialog_3"><text>Sorry, professor, but I don't have time for this now. Maybe later...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_02_dialog_4"><text>Hmm, indeed, what am I burdening you with?! We're in no hurry, especially since studying the possibility of using spatial anomalies was your initiative. Come back if you change your mind.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_02_dialog_6"><text>Here, take it. When you install it, come back, we'll see if there's enough data...</text></string>
<string id="tex_yan_scientist_teleport_02"><text>Professor Sakharov asked to install the device at Cordon, somewhere on top of the destroyed railway bridge supports</text></string>

<string id="teleport_02_2dialog_0"><text>I installed your device at Cordon. Any data?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_02_2dialog_1"><text>Yes, some data is coming from it. But... I think there's some error here! It turns out that the phase amplitude of spatial continuum remains independent of the distance gradient! Only the temporal constant changes! But... This can't be!\nWe'll try to derive a general equation of the teleportation field based on these materials. Of course, careful verification is required...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_02_2dialog_2"><text>I see. And how long will you be "verifying"?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_02_2dialog_3"><text>I can't say right now. In any case, I think we're in for a revolution in understanding the most fundamental basis of the universe - time. If everything is confirmed, I'll mention you in my report!</text></string>
<string id="teleport_02_2dialog_4"><text>I'm just thrilled... But couldn't you, instead of mentioning me in a report sometime later, give something substantial right now?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_02_2dialog_5"><text>How mercantile you are... Will you take medical supplies? Here's a bit. Interested in recipes? Write down the method for obtaining the "Dummy" artifact.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_02_2dialog_6"><text>Nothing special, but it doesn't hurt.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_02_2dialog_11"><text>Hmm... Strange. We're not receiving a signal. Did you definitely install the device? Where needed? Please check once more if it's working...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_02_2dialog_21"><text>Uh-h-h... I'll double-check.</text></string>

<string id="teleport_03_dialog_0"><text>How's the device at Cordon? You wanted to check something else there...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_03_dialog_1"><text>The device? Yes-yes, it's working... \nMy dear fellow, I understand you probably don't want to risk it again, but... We'd like to get data from a point that directly contacts the Zone's epicenter. \nIf possible, could you install similar equipment somewhere in the city of Pripyat? Installation height doesn't matter there. But let's try to get data from the city's central square for more precise positioning. Close to... no, actually. Behind Lenin's monument.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_03_dialog_2"><text>Pripyat?! No, professor, that's too much. It's hard enough to get there, let alone drag your contraption... Let's finish our experiments, these two teleportation points are enough for me, and for your scientific report you can find someone else.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_03_dialog_3"><text>Too bad, I thought we worked well together. Well, we'll try to find a new... volunteer.</text></string>

<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_0"><text>Professor, will you help me set up the teleporter?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_1"><text>Why not? However, you're a risky person... Where would you like to get to?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_2"><text>Wouldn't be bad to end up at the Army Warehouses...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_3"><text>To Cordon. Got some business there.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_21"><text>Ah, square 72! We have the data, in principle. Well, we can do it now.\nDo you have an anomalous formation of series 896? They also call it "Compass".</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_22"><text>Yes, I have it.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_23"><text>Don't have one... Thought you'd have it.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_221"><text>Well then, calibrating all parameters takes time, and time, as you know, is money...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_222"><text>And how much will I owe you?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_223"><text>We've been dealing with each other for some time now. I think donating any simple artifact for research purposes would compensate for the equipment time spent.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_224"><text>Alright, agreed, I'll donate... Here's the "Compass" too.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_226"><text>Nah, I'll just walk there on foot...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_25"><text>Excellent. Please wait about fifteen minutes... We'll model the data in the program and adjust the crystal formations of this artifact based on the results.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_27"><text>Good. Go ahead and adjust it.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_31"><text>Cordon? The Zone's outskirts... That's possible.\nGive me your "Compass". Do you have it?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_32"><text>Here it is, my precious... Like a toy.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_33"><text>And I thought you had one...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_321"><text>We'll have to redirect some computing power for calculations. It's quite costly. We'll need to justify these expenses with solid arguments later...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_322"><text>And what kind of "argument" would satisfy you?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_323"><text>In this case, any simple artifact would suffice. We can put it through the reports as necessary research.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_324"><text>Good. Here's a simple artifact and the "Compass".</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_326"><text>Nah, I'll just walk there on foot...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_35"><text>You'll have to wait a bit while our computer performs the necessary calculations. Ten minutes, maybe twenty.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_yantar_dialog_37"><text>Alright, I'll wait.</text></string>

<string id="saharov_teleport_end_0"><text>What about the "Compass" calibration? Is it ready?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_end_11"><text>You need to be more patient, young man. This operation requires very precise calculations. So please wait.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_end_12"><text>We managed to align the structural elements on the artifact to the correct position. The teleportation point has been set with precision... well, I'll spare you the details you don't need. Everything is ready. Though in your position I wouldn't risk using such unproven methods...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_end_21"><text>Alright, alright, I'll wait...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_end_22"><text>I've had to risk myself with more serious things.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_end_3"><text>Your choice. The anomalous formation of the nearest node, according to latest data, hasn't changed its location - it's still there, on the islet in the swamp, behind our bunker. Don't forget to activate the calibrated artifact!</text></string>

<string id="teleport_04_dialog_0"><text>Listen, you've been here for a while now, right? Heard about teleporting?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_04_dialog_1"><text>Well not that long... But not just since yesterday either. Not only heard about teleports, but even met a guy who said he could set one up himself. He even showed me how it's done, but it's very complicated. And expensive. You need to use a very good artifact. And know a specific location, and account for other factors - it's a whole science. For us stalkers, it's not worth it. Easier to just walk quietly where you need to go than blow a whole fortune in artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_04_dialog_2"><text>Wait, wait! You're saying you can "configure" a teleporter?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_04_dialog_3"><text>Yes, you can... But like I said - you need to know how. Otherwise you might "fly" so far that no one will ever find you. And knowledge costs money...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_04_dialog_4"><text>Yeah, I figured! And how much should I pay you?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_04_dialog_5"><text>Whoa, you got all excited... First you need maps of the place where you want to set up the teleporter. Not regular ones, but detailed geological-seismological maps...\nIf we can find those, then we can talk about something...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_04_dialog_6"><text>And where might such maps be found?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_04_dialog_7"><text>Well, when they built the underground laboratories, they usually made such detailed maps. Maybe something survived. I don't know. I didn't really need them, but if you're interested - you're the one who should look for them.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_04_dialog_8"><text>Alright, the maps are clear. But where do you already know how to get to? You do know some places, right?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_04_dialog_9"><text>Uh-h-h... Yes. I know a couple places. For example, I've set up one to the Swamp. To the Gut too... But that's close by. If I had maps, I could calculate farther distances. To the Warehouses, for example, or somewhere else. So if you're interested, you need to go underground. There might be the information we need.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_04_dialog_91"><text>In the laboratories? It's tempting, of course, but dangerous there. I'll think about it.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_04_dialog_92"><text>Ah, screw it... I'll manage for now.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_04_dialog_10"><text>It's dangerous here too. Think it over.</text></string>
<string id="tex_fanat_teleport_04"><text>\nFanatic says he can set up a teleporter for jumping from Cordon to the Army Warehouses. For this, he needs to find detailed geological-seismological maps somewhere in the laboratories</text></string>

<string id="teleport_042_dialog_0"><text>I found a laptop in... a basement, seems to still be working. Probably maps could be there too...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_042_dialog_1"><text>What kind of maps? Did you at least check?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_042_dialog_21"><text>How can I check? See for yourself.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_042_dialog_22"><text>Nah, wait, I'll come back again.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_042_dialog_3"><text>Hmm... It even turns on, would you look at that! Yeah, there are maps! Right! I'll consult with the guys here, and you come back tomorrow. Maybe something will work out.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_042_dialog_4"><text>Go ahead and consult, I'll wait.</text></string>

<string id="teleport_043_dialog_0"><text>So what's in the laptop? Can we set up a teleporter somewhere else?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_043_dialog_11"><text>Yeah, me and the guys thought about it, seems like there's geological survey data in that laptop. I think it's the Army Warehouses, you know, where the Freedomers hang out. Worth a try. But you need a "Compass" artifact... Heard of such a thing?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_043_dialog_12"><text>Wait up! This ain't simple stuff! It'll smear you between here and nowhere - you'll be the one to blame then... You gotta think!</text></string>
<string id="teleport_043_dialog_6"><text>Yeah-yeah, think away, I'll wait...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_043_dialog_2"><text>"Compass"? Well yeah. So what? Can I fly?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_043_dialog_3"><text>Well... Kinda like that... On this "Compass" there are little thingies, moving them in a special way you can roughly determine where it'll take you... So yeah - everything seems normal.\nWell, since you worked so hard - write down this useful recipe.</text></string>

<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_0"><text>Help me use the teleporter...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_1"><text>Well, I see you don't value your life much. And where are you headed?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_2"><text>To the Warehouses, let's see how things are there...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_5"><text>To the Swamp. Got business there...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_6"><text>To the Gut, or I'll have to walk there!</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_21"><text>To create the teleporter we need a "Compass".\nYou got one?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_22"><text>Yes, I have one...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_23"><text>Hmm, no. Don't have one...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_221"><text>Hand it over... The guys here help me with calculations, gotta thank them somehow...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_222"><text>Alright, how much do you need?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_223"><text>Money's dust. Give me an artifact. A simple one.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_224"><text>Deal, here's an artifact.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_226"><text>Man, you guys got some appetite, I'll walk there myself.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_25"><text>Good. We'll calibrate the "Compass". Come back in about ten minutes. You'll pick it up.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_27"><text>Uh-huh, get to work.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_51"><text>Calibration requires a "Compass".\nYou got one?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_52"><text>Yes, I have one...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_53"><text>Hmm, no. Don't have one...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_521"><text>Hand it over... The guys here help me with calculations, gotta thank them somehow...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_522"><text>Alright, how much do you need?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_523"><text>Keep your wooden ones. Give me an artifact. A simple one.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_524"><text>Deal, here's an artifact.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_526"><text>Man, you guys got some appetite, I'll walk there myself.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_55"><text>Good. We'll calibrate your "Compass". Come back in about ten minutes. You'll pick it up.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_57"><text>Uh-huh, get to work.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_61"><text>Remember the "Compass"?\nYou got it with you?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_62"><text>Yeah-yeah. I got it...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_63"><text>Hmm, no. Don't have a "Compass"...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_621"><text>Gotta pay for the calculations. To the guys...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_622"><text>Pay, pay. Same thing all the time. How much?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_623"><text>Minimum price - a simple little artifact.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_624"><text>Alright. Deal, here's an artifact...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_626"><text>No way. I'd rather take a nice walk than give up an artifact!</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_65"><text>While we're calibrating your "Compass", take a walk, rest up. Come back in about fifteen minutes... You'll pick it up.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_escape_dialog_67"><text>Alright, I'll rest for a while.</text></string>

<string id="fanat_teleport_end_0"><text>So what about the "Compass" calibration? Ready?</text></string>
<string id="fanat_teleport_end_11"><text>Wait up! What are you, some kind of hothead or what... Huh? You'll get stuck in a rock, then you'll be the one to blame!</text></string>
<string id="fanat_teleport_end_12"><text>Well it's ready now. Are you completely nuts? The odds are 50-50! Remember how to use it? Over there in the ravine, in the fog, there's this orb - semi-transparent. Activate the calibrated "Compass" on your belt and step into it. Yeah. Maybe you'll come back.</text></string>
<string id="fanat_teleport_end_21"><text>Alright, alright, I'll wait...</text></string>
<string id="fanat_teleport_end_22"><text>Ah come on, we'll figure it out! If we're alive - we won't die!</text></string>
<string id="fanat_teleport_end_3"><text>Well, see for yourself. Take it. Uh-h-h...</text></string>

<string id="teleport_07_dialog_0"><text>Why are your eyes so red? Hungover again?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_07_dialog_1"><text>Well... there was a good reason. Would've been a sin not to overindulge.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_07_dialog_2"><text>You guys always have a reason for that. Either night fell, or the sun rose.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_07_dialog_3"><text>This is different, Marked One. Heard about teleports? Turns out you can teleport to almost anywhere in the Zone! If you know how, of course. You just need an artifact, the "Compass" one. I was still wondering why it's called that, and here's how! Pulled on its little things and there - it worked! So Max and I were... mastering this science all night. Already experimenting. Sent a volunteer to Sidorovich. There and back - made the round trip in half an hour.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_07_dialog_4"><text>To Cordon and back in half an hour, you say? How could I get in on your knowledge?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_07_dialog_5"><text>Remember the law? You know, the one - "you scratch my back, I scratch yours"? I need three chimera claws, bring them to me - then we'll talk.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_07_dialog_6"><text>And why three?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_07_dialog_7"><text>What, did you fall off the oak tree? Three is a magic number, heard of the magic triangle? Well and... I got this special recipe with claws - need to try it out.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_07_dialog_8"><text>If the chance comes up - I'll bring you the claws.</text></string>
<string id="tex_mil_trader_teleport_07"><text>Bootlegger promises to set up a teleporter for travel from the Warehouses to Cordon if you bring him three chimera claws</text></string>

<string id="teleport_072_dialog_0"><text>Magic lover, I brought your claws.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_072_dialog_1"><text>Oh! I'll hang them on the wall - the aura will be positive.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_072_dialog_21"><text>Aura... Drink less and the aura will be cleaner. You were talking about the teleporter.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_072_dialog_22"><text>Hey! Sober up first!</text></string>
<string id="teleport_072_dialog_3"><text>You'd teach your wife to cook soup. As for the teleporter... Look, I won't tell you the secret itself, don't even ask. But I'll help with portal calibration, no problem. When you got a "Compass", come by. I'll twist some things around and then you can fly like plywood over Paris. For brainwork I'll take a simple little artifact.\nAnd this is from my generosity, for the little claws.</text></string>

<string id="teleport_08_dialog_0"><text>Bootlegger says you've mastered making teleportation jumps?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_08_dialog_1"><text>There's something to that. I still don't understand how the revelation happened... something just clicked in my brain and I started knowing how to calculate teleportation to Yantar.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_08_dialog_2"><text>Will you tell me? Or is it a secret only for the initiated? Maybe I need to bring something in exchange?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_08_dialog_3"><text>It's a secret, of course. But I don't really need anything special. Got enough grub, vodka's available, fresh air. A woman would be nice, but where would you find one.\nThough, you know... Go to Yantar, the guys there travel to the mainland regularly, they probably have fresh issues of "Playboy". If they agree to share, bring me some. At least we'll look at heavenly creatures... I'll help you with teleporter calibration then, if the need arises.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_08_dialog_41"><text>I'll ask around, won't hurt to try.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_08_dialog_42"><text>Man, you're something... Seems like a grown man.</text></string>
<string id="tex_mil_max_teleport_08"><text>\nMax promises to set up a teleporter for travel from the Warehouses to Yantar if you bring him "Playboy" magazines from the eggheads</text></string>

<string id="teleport_082_dialog_0"><text>About the teleporter. Here are the magazines with beauties.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_082_dialog_1"><text>Thank you, Marked One, we'd already forgotten what a WOMAN is...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_082_dialog_2"><text>Here, refresh your memory...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_082_dialog_3"><text>Come by when you want to zip over to Yantar. Just bring a "Compass" with you, I sold mine out of necessity.</text></string>

<string id="teleport_083_dialog_0"><text>Hello there, science!</text></string>
<string id="teleport_083_dialog_1"><text>And stay healthy. On business?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_083_dialog_2"><text>They say you guys have magazines here, you know, like "Playboy"... fresh issues.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_083_dialog_21"><text>Ha! And who's been spreading such rumors?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_083_dialog_22"><text>Well... People are longing for women. Some are already starting to forget what they look like. You know, the soul yearns for beauty and all that. So, what about it?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_083_dialog_3"><text>Alright, since people in the Zone are still interested in "that sort of thing", it means loot isn't the only thing on people's minds, which can't help but be encouraging... Here, take them. Though I only have issues from 2006.</text></string>

<string id="teleport_skraga_dialog_0"><text>You know, I wanna teleport.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_skraga_dialog_1"><text>Teleporter? Hmm... And where you headed?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_skraga_dialog_2"><text>Where, where? To Cordon, wasn't that what we talked about?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_skraga_dialog_3"><text>Well, I know about Cordon. Maybe you learned something else? The Zone teaches everyone different things. Yesterday one thing, today - another. You didn't happen to forget the "Compass"? 'Cause I ain't givin' you mine. And I'll take a simple artifact too, as payment for mental work.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_skraga_dialog_41"><text>Yeah, I got it... When will it be ready?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_skraga_dialog_42"><text>You know what, I'll come back later somehow.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_skraga_dialog_5"><text>Don't rush. Gotta figure out so you don't get smeared against some walls when you land. You never know.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_skraga_dialog_6"><text>I'm starting to get worried about this.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_skraga_dialog_7"><text>Don't worry. I'll drop you right into Sidorovich's little room.\nSo, I'll think things over here for a bit, and you take a walk. Not long. Twenty minutes.</text></string>

<string id="skraga_teleport_end_0"><text>So, you "figured it out" already? Calibrated the "Compass"?</text></string>
<string id="skraga_teleport_end_11"><text>Hey you... Don't rush! The channel ain't opened yet. Need more time.</text></string>
<string id="skraga_teleport_end_12"><text>Yeah, all good. Here's the little "Compass". Fixed it up proper. Now head over to Bloodsucker Village, there's kinda like a transparent orb there. Put the little "Compass" on your belt - and off you go. Won't even blink and there's Sidorovich's mug... You ain't scared?</text></string>
<string id="skraga_teleport_end_21"><text>Channel... What a mess...</text></string>
<string id="skraga_teleport_end_22"><text>You there, don't shake yourself. You'll drop it.</text></string>
<string id="skraga_teleport_end_3"><text>Yeah. Move it, tough guy... </text></string>

<string id="teleport_max_dialog_0"><text>Need to fly over to Yantar... Teleport.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_max_dialog_1"><text>Why can't you just stay put...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_max_dialog_2"><text>Can't stay put - not my nature...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_max_dialog_21"><text>Ah, nature... You got the "Compass" with you?\nI don't have one, but you?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_max_dialog_22"><text>Yeah, of course, here.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_max_dialog_23"><text>Don't have it with me...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_max_dialog_221"><text>For mental work I'll take an artifact. Because - any work should be rewarded.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_max_dialog_222"><text>And what artifact should I reward you with?</text></string>
<string id="teleport_max_dialog_223"><text>If I really strain my brain and guarantee to throw you out in a safe place, then... Hmm. Ah! Alright, a simple artifact - and we're in business...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_max_dialog_224"><text>In business? Well... Alright, here you go.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_max_dialog_226"><text>I'll save the artifacts, I guess, I'll get there myself...</text></string>
<string id="teleport_max_dialog_25"><text>Don't frown. You understand yourself - one person will always help another! Not for free, of course... I'm kidding. Just wait a bit. I'll remember properly how these pins should be positioned on the "Compass". Ten minutes, maybe twenty.</text></string>
<string id="teleport_max_dialog_27"><text>Well, remember it good!</text></string>

<string id="max_teleport_end_0"><text>Remembered how to set up the teleport? Or what?</text></string>
<string id="max_teleport_end_11"><text>Still need to cobble together a couple more elements. Wait for now.</text></string>
<string id="max_teleport_end_12"><text>Yeah. Seems I set everything up right. You can risk it. "Compass" on the belt, turned on the battery and forward - to Bloodsucker Village. There near the transformer booth you probably saw a semi-transparent orb. Dive in there. And... Maybe you'll surface at Yantar...</text></string>
<string id="max_teleport_end_21"><text>Alright, alright, I'll wait...</text></string>
<string id="max_teleport_end_22"><text>Come on, we'll figure it out! If we're alive - we won't die!</text></string>
<string id="max_teleport_end_3"><text>Well, it's up to you. Take it...</text></string>

<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_0"><text>Help me cook up a "Slug" with your recipe, just make sure it's all in the "green".</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_11"><text>Oh yeah! And straight in the "green"?! The one from "Springboard"? Well for that you need experience. And it, like impotence, is an acquired thing. Heh-heh.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_12"><text>Can't you see I can barely straighten up properly, let alone... You better do it yourself.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_13"><text>Did you complete the task? What was needed for the recipe - did you bring it?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_14"><text>No time now, come back later.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_2"><text>Experience - that's understandable. Do you have experience? Maybe we can make a deal?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_3"><text>Maybe... but you understand yourself... you scratch my back - I'll scratch yours.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_4"><text>What do you need this time?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_5"><text>I got some urgent business piled up here. Gotta finish it. A couple deliveries to make. Can't spare the guys, you can see what's happening here, monsters keep coming, every gun counts. But you - you're a free bird. So, how about it? It's not far, to Sidorovich and the Swamps, and to the Gut too.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_6"><text>That's... not far for you, maybe I'll deliver it... But I don't get it, what about the artifact?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_7"><text>With the artifact? It's simple. You bring me everything on the list, I'll cook this thing for you, since you're... clumsy, it'll be all green. But only after we settle our business.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_81"><text>The list, you mean... Tell me, where and what to take.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_91"><text>Here's how it is, listen carefully: \nSidorovich asked for rare artifacts to be brought to him, if you come across any... Here... we found one like that. But make it quick, he's been waiting a long time. \nYou know about the nerds at the Swamps? They study critters real intensively... We collected some boar hooves here, the kind they're interested in. Take them quick, before they spoil. \nThe hunters in the Gut make all sorts of things from tails. Well, we cut the choice ones for them. Also gotta be quick, so they don't go bad. </text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_82"><text>I may be a free bird, but I got enough troubles of my own, I'll manage somehow.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_92"><text>Your choice, Marked One. Could've had a good artifact though.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_10"><text>You sure talked a lot... Give me your tails and hooves with the artifact. Should write it down so I don't forget who, where and how much.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_101"><text>Here, don't lose it. And I'll scout out the right anomaly in the meantime, gotta know which one and where to look for it too.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_102"><text>I'll try to be quick. It's really tempting to get such an artifact.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_131"><text>Did everything and brought it - take it.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_132"><text>No, not everything yet.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cook_dialog_121"><text>I'll try it myself.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_ameba_slug_cooked_dialog_11"><text>Of course! The recipe was precise... Everything as ordered.</text></string>

<string id="volk_simbion_start_1"><text>You saw him?! So how is he there?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_start_2"><text>He's sitting with some stalkers, sipping vodka, complaining about his fate.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_start_3"><text>Ah... Well, that's his favorite song lately when he's drunk.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_start_4"><text>The guy's burned out, it seems. The Zone's grown stale for him.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_start_5"><text>Don't tell me about his hardships. What's Petruha up to? Drinking his life away or does he have some interest there?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_start_6"><text>He's looking for a stash. Says once he finds it, the sweet life will begin for him. So far though, without much success. He's looking for your stash, by the way.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_start_7"><text>Mine?! Didn't think he'd dare to do such a thing... And anyway, what gave him the idea that I stashed my loot at Forgotten Village?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_start_8"><text>Wolf, you asked me to find out about Petruha, I found out. What and why he's searching there is none of my business. I'll drop by later, maybe we'll discuss something.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_start_9"><text>Really none of your business? Alright, thanks anyway. Come by if you change your mind. We'll chat.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_start_10"><text>We'll definitely chat.</text></string>

<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_0"><text>Remember the conversation about Forgotten Village?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_1"><text>Can't complain about my memory. Did you find out anything else about Petruha or...?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_2"><text>Exactly that "or", Wolf. I found at the Village - purely by accident - an inconspicuous backpack in the outhouse. Inside was a note, meant for Petruha, as I understand. About your carefree childhood, your mother the teacher, troublesome students.... That got my interest and I decided to seriously search the area. Soon I found your second stash, the real one. With a container and another note for Petruha. You wanted to play it safe, since you're offering him a "truce" there? Thought he'd instantly forget everything and come running here with his tongue hanging out to drag your loot?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_3"><text>Maybe he would've taken the bait, fool. What's it to you? Who is he to you, brother or in-law? I just can't figure out: why did you drag your ass all the way here to tell me all this? Come to confess that you had your eye on someone else's stuff? Well, I don't absolve sins - that's for Diodor. I can only put a bullet in your forehead for ratting. Or maybe you want to shame me into something?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_4"><text>You'd better hold off on the threats, I'm not Petruha and I'm not some green rookie, so don't lean on me with your voice. And don't make me out to be a rat. As if everyone here is perfectly righteous. At Cordon, in the village, how many stalkers have your "problem" boys ripped off? They sit around all day, shooting the shit, eating, drinking... On what money? Or didn't you have a clue what your young punks were up to?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_5"><text>Marked One, don't get in my face and stick your tongue where the sun don't shine. You found my stash, so count yourself lucky and get lost... before things get ugly.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_6"><text>Hold on, don't get heated... I already told you I don't do ratting. Your stashes at the Village were, honestly speaking, shit out of luck. It's actually surprising that nobody managed to stumble on them before me. I've stashed your valuables somewhere safe for now, but I'm ready to return everything if you promise to rein in your scumbags at Cordon. It ain't human, after all. Consider it instead of payment. But if you share some useful information, I'd be grateful. You know what interests me.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_7"><text>So that's how it is? Alright, consider we have a deal. Bring me my artifacts, and grab that note too. I don't want Petruha to "accidentally" read it later.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_treasure_8"><text>If you haven't tossed it already. Wait up, I'll be quick.</text></string>

<string id="volk_simbion_give_0"><text>Brought your treasures, Wolf.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_1"><text>You brought them? I was honestly having doubts. Who knows what you were in your past life. I'll keep my word, the young guys from Cordon will get a talking-to today. I just don't know what "useful" thing I could tell you. Since you found my stash, I'll tell you, I suppose, where that container with artifacts came from. I'm thinking maybe both of us can profit from this.\nThere was this stalker who'd visit Cordon village periodically, one of those loners who treads the Zone solo. Never stayed long: would drop off goods to Sidorovich and immediately fuck off. No "hello" or "goodbye" to you. Plenty of such folk visit our old rogue benefactor. Always closer to nightfall. Dark people, but they don't bother the youngsters, keep order, throw the "diesel man" a coin or two. So one time this stalker asked permission to spend the night in our cellar. Vergas' "barometer" had already triggered that evening, an emission was forecasted for the night. And apparently it wasn't convenient for him to split.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_2"><text>So your boys... fleeced him then?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_3"><text>Listen, don't start that shit again, yeah?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_4"><text>Alright, alright, I'm quiet. Continue.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_5"><text>Evening came, and as usual, we sat by the fire. Had some drinks, snacks, bitched about our lives. This stalker didn't refuse the hospitality, even put some of his own stuff on the table. Though he didn't join the general conversation, just chewed and drank quietly. Closer to night I checked the posts, settled down the youngsters, sent them off to their mattresses, and we were left alone. He kept quiet, and I didn't pry with questions. We smoked and knocked back shots.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_51"><text>That's clear, let's get to the point already.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_52"><text>Don't interrupt... \nThen the Emission hit. I casually headed to the cellar, but this guy just sits there, doesn't budge. Well, I think, he's slow from the booze, but why rush him - the shelter's two steps away, he'll make it. But no, he tilted his head to the sky and sits there. I looked from the basement: everything's shaking like hell, and he's sitting. His black eyes bulging at the sky... I went back down to the cellar, who knows how many nutjobs the Zone has spawned, one more, one less. When the apocalypse ended, I climbed out, and he's knocking back a shot and eating sausage. Of course, I immediately grabbed my gun - it's not every day you meet a living zombie in the village. But no, he looked the same as before. Thoughtful gaze, human appearance. I've had to weather emissions in open fields too. At Cordon it doesn't hit too hard, but you still walk around like you got the plague for half a day. But you couldn't tell with him. That something wasn't clean here immediately came to mind. Out of the corner of my eye I spotted an unusual artifact on his belt, never had to see such a thing before. And believe me, Marked One, I've seen plenty of unusual shit. But this stalker managed to surprise me.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_53"><text>Hey Wolf, you sure you didn't just imagine all this while drunk?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_54"><text>Interrupt again with your "smart" comments, and that's where the story ends. Listen on... \nI say to the stalker: "What's with these experiments, uncle, and in a crowded place too? The people here are weak-nerved, not hardened by the Zone. Such a show is contraindicated for them. If life has gotten boring, a bullet will settle everything quickly, and if you want to suffer before death, then go to Radar. They'll cook your brains into jelly real quick there. Walk through the forest, moo around, maybe someone will hear and put you out of your misery." And he just grins. Fucking magician, homegrown sorcerer. Fine, I say: "If you're a master at pulling such tricks, share your secret. It's not a military secret. And I can put up a couple of wonderful things in exchange." \nSurprisingly - he agreed to trade, apparently our hospitality hit the spot, and the vodka did its job. We settled on a price. Didn't take much. He gave me a set of artifacts, the very same ones from the container, and attached a recipe to them. The artifact made from them gives good protection from all kinds of telepathy. Though, as luck would have it, in that emission my PDA burned out, I wrote the recipe on paper, and then somewhere I successfully lost... misplaced it, basically. I stashed the artifacts at Forgotten Village for the time being, until I get the recipe again. Only it happened that you found my stash earlier.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_61"><text>Interesting. Such an artifact would come in really handy for me, especially when I'm planning to head further North. There, from what I've heard, your brains boil instantly without good protection.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_62"><text>Holy shit, I actually know that recipe. The artifact is called "Symbion", right?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_71"><text>I was hoping that maybe you know that recipe. The artifacts, as you can see, are useful, but what to do with them... Can't just throw them randomly into every anomaly you come across. That piece of paper with the recipe, I kind of didn't use it for hygienic purposes by mistake, or maybe I just dropped it somewhere accidentally. You, Marked One, here's the thing... If you happen to find out the recipe, don't be lazy to find me. I'm not promising mountains of gold, but you'll get a tip about decent loot.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_72"><text>Yeah I don't remember, maybe it is. Will you share the recipe? I'll give you a tip about decent loot. True, you'll have to trek further north for it, but you need to go to those parts anyway. Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_811"><text>Alright, I'll keep you in mind. But now - time for me to go. Take your valuables. And here's the note too, as you asked.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_812"><text>Alright, I'll keep you in mind. But now - time for me to go. Take your valuables. I couldn't find that note. Looks like I already managed to toss it, don't blame me.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_821"><text>Hold on, let's first deal with your artifacts. Here, take them, everything's accounted for. And here's the note, as you asked.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_822"><text>Hold on, let's first deal with your artifacts. Here, take them, everything's accounted for. I couldn't find that note. Looks like I already managed to toss it, don't blame me.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_9"><text>I'm not offering you anything, and there's really nothing to talk about. No recipe and that's it. If you find any information about this matter yourself, then come see me. But for now, it is what it is. Well, thanks for returning the artifacts. And here, take some ammo from me, it'll come in handy.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_921"><text>Well, everything's in place. You can keep the container and here's some ammo from me, it'll come in handy. And I'm treating you separately for the note. Thanks.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_give_922"><text>The main thing for me is the artifacts. And the note... fuck it! I just hope you won't go blabbering to Petruha about this whole story. Yeah, you can keep the container and here's some ammo from me, it'll come in handy.</text></string>

<string id="volk_simbion_final_0"><text>About that recipe for the telepathy protection artifact...</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_1"><text>You know one? Where from, if it's not a secret?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_2"><text>I was in a former laboratory, in Dark Valley, that's where I happened to learn about it.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_3"><text>How? I heard all entrances to it are sealed shut.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_4"><text>Turns out, not so shut after all. Basically, I was crawling around there on my own business, and stumbled on it by accident, you could say.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_5"><text>But still, what got you to go to that laboratory? What business could an ordinary stalker have there? Smart people avoid even the blocked entrances by taking the tenth road around. They said darkness lives there, death lives there.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_6"><text>That's just how it worked out. I'd prefer not to go into details. And the bony one is, like, my relative or godmother. I fell from her truck. You know that.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_7"><text>Yeah... when you showed up in the village, you looked exactly like you'd been taken down from a cross. People say about such folk: "they'd look better laid in a coffin".</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_8"><text>And how I showed up, do you remember?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_9"><text>Well... you ask the Doctor, he was putting you back into human shape, he'll answer. I was away at the time. You didn't finish about the recipe...</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_10"><text>Right. This artifact is called "Symbion", cooked for about 10 minutes in "Fruit Punch" from that set you had. Really does protect well against psi-influence. By the way, one thought keeps nagging me: how did that stalker you told me about know all this? I'm thinking you knew him even before that incident. Or am I wrong?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_11"><text>Marked One, did you come to share the recipe or conduct an interrogation? Who knows where he learned it from, maybe he figured it out through trial and error himself. Besides, that guy hasn't shown up at Cordon for a couple months now. It's all the same here: either dead, or he got out of the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_12"><text>Alright, my head's already stuffed with riddles as it is. What about our deal?</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_13"><text>As promised, I'm giving you a tip about one interesting stash, it's in Red Forest. Since your road lies north, you'll definitely be in those parts, won't pass it by. Here are the coordinates, I'll mark it on your PDA now. Just better try to remember the terrain right away. These pieces of shit glitch sometimes. It happens that the marker can disappear. Or the damn device stops working altogether.</text></string>
<string id="volk_simbion_final_14"><text>Alright. I'll be going, see you around.</text></string> 
<!--    -->
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_0"><text>Still telling jokes?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_1"><text>Marked One, listen, how are you on free time? Could you help us solve one problem? If you have the time and desire, of course.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_2"><text>Problems? I'm not a scientist, what use am I to science? Or are you inviting me to be a test subject? I still want to live!</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_3"><text>No-no, friend, you misunderstood everything a bit.</text></string> 
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_4"><text>Yeah, understanding you eggheads is quite the problem. What do you want?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_5"><text>You see... we have several measurement complexes deployed in different locations. Unfortunately, the remote radio channel is extremely unstable, and we can't receive the necessary information for long periods. We need to deliver cards with accumulated data from recorders located in various parts of the Zone. I'm asking you to make a voyage there and extract the cards with accumulated material. I guarantee a good reward.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_6"><text>And you, who suffered in the unequal battle with mercenaries, are in no shape now, you have stress?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_7"><text>Marked One, understand me correctly too. Right now it's really inconvenient for me and my assistants to leave Yantar for long. There's one deal coming up, and our counterpart in this matter should appear any day now. The deal will be profitable for you too, by the way. If everything goes well and, as they say, the parties come to a consensus, then subsequently, after completing all the work with the recorders, I would help you with artifact exchange. Namely: trading one second-level artifact for three random first-level ones, from those that will be at hand. Or for two specific ones, your choice, but then your artifact must be in excellent condition and no lower than third grade. Think about it, who else in the Zone will offer you such fantastic terms?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_8"><text>Small business, everything's clear with you guys. And what will you tell Sakharov? How will you explain to him where you got the data when you've been sitting at Yantar the whole time?</text></string> 
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_9"><text>Life's realities are such that man cannot live by bread alone. Alas. Especially when there's an opportunity to diversify the menu a bit, like... add cheese and butter to the bread. You, I think, see everything yourself - scientific activity is not the professor's only income. He's far from an altruist. Artifact exchange for equipment, how to put it right... well, you get it. The main thing is results.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_10"><text>So there won't be any friction between you. I really wouldn't want to find myself on the front line of your feud. And I'd like to discuss the payment question right away. What do you offer?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_11"><text>I see, Marked One, you have an entrepreneurial streak in you.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_12"><text>You can't help but become enterprising here. One thing they only trade at Swamp, another can only be found at Yantar, the third - devil knows where...</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_13"><text>So let's talk about Swamp. The first four recorders are located right there. The area is familiar to you, I hope. Four towers are active there, there shouldn't be problems with extracting the cards. Upon completion of the work you'll get a recipe for one good modificate and medicines. You taking it?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_14"><text>Recipe, medicine, exchange... And is it worth it?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_15"><text>The job's completely trivial, well, trivial for you. Payment's good, come by, don't drag it out.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_start_16"><text>I'll think about it, other business has piled up for now. Maybe later.</text></string>
<!--  -->
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_0"><text>I'm here about the cards from the recorders at Swamp. The offer still stands?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_1"><text>Made up your mind?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_21"><text>I'm just curious, I'm not ready yet for scientific exploits.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_22"><text>At least outline where and what to look for. Swamp is big.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_3"><text>Then let's get to business. I'll mark the complex locations on your PDA. Oh, and if possible, don't drag this out - consider the work urgent. It's been a month without a single stable communication session with that area, and as a result we have firewood prices from the Arctic instead of observation data.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_4"><text>I'll try not to take long.</text></string>  

<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_0"><text>Job's done, science.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_1"><text>What job? What are you talking about?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_2"><text>Brought the cards from the recorders at Swamp, the data's there.\nHey, where are you reaching? First the recipe, the reward - you promised!</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_3"><text>Ah, well done, Marked One! Sorry, got completely wound up. I've uploaded the recipe to your PDA. Some medicine too, with what we have on hand. Good enough?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_4"><text>Hmm. Not bad. What's next?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_5"><text>About the other recorders, come by a bit later. In about ten minutes. Need to cross-check the data.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_bolota_done_6"><text>I'll drop by Sakharov for now.</text></string>
<!--   -->
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_0"><text>Kruglov, what about the data, has it been clarified?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_1"><text>Right. We need to retrieve cards with accumulated data from complexes in the so-called "Foggy Thicket". According to latest reports, three installations are still working there. You up for it? Same reward - recipe and medicine.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_21"><text>Foggy Thicket, you say... Not the most pleasant place, from what I've been told. Agreed, here's the PDA - mark the search area.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_22"><text>I'm just curious, I'm not ready yet for scientific exploits.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_3"><text>Excellent, here, here and here. But remember - we need the cards soon: then a new measurement cycle will begin and the collected parametric data will become obsolete.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_4"><text>Got it, I'll try not to drag it out.</text></string>

<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_done_0"><text>Hey, science! Got the cards from the devices in Foggy Thicket. Where's my recipe? Hope it'll be something worthwhile, not like last time.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_done_1"><text>Don't doubt it - it'll come in handy. Give me the PDA, I'll upload the recipe.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_done_2"><text>Let's see your "thing". And the rest? We had a deal.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_done_3"><text>Ah, yes, sorry, I forgot.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_done_4"><text>You're being a rogue, got a taste for trading?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_done_5"><text>There's one more place, a pair of recorders working in Red Forest. Will you take it on?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_aver_done_6"><text>I'll think about it.</text></string>
<!--   -->
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_0"><text>Shall we continue our scientific exploits? I'm talking about the cards from the recorders.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_1"><text>Marked One, you're not planning to take a stroll to Zone 65 in the near future? "Red Forest", if you will.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_21"><text>Red Forest? From what veteran stalkers told me, Red Forest isn't some park for recreation where you "take a stroll". You won't get by with just a recipe and a couple medkits here. All the Zone's fauna gathered in one place there. Jaws wide open, just waiting for someone to devour. Our deal is still on, of course, but you understand - you might not come back from there at all. And as usual, you need it urgent and fast?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_22"><text>I'm just curious, I'm not ready yet for scientific exploits.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_4"><text>Good. If you complete this assignment, you'll get a "salary raise" in the form of a very rare artifact. And I think the exchange matter will finally be resolved. As they say - "the client has matured".</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_5"><text>I'm counting on your honesty.</text></string>  
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_6"><text>Excellent, so we have a deal. The recorders are located here and here. But remember - we need the cards as soon as possible, because then a new measurement cycle will begin, and the collected parametric data will become obsolete.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_7"><text>I remember, I remember. I'll try not to drag it out.</text></string>

<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_done_0"><text>Hey, science! Here are your cards from Red Forest, now give me my recipe, bonus and whatever else... what's due to me. I'm pretty worn out.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_done_1"><text>Give me the PDA, I'll upload the recipe.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_done_2"><text>And the rest? Where's the "salary raise"? We had a deal. And by the way, what about the exchange? When will it be resolved?</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_done_3"><text>You hurt my feelings, Marked One. The first batch for exchange is already ready. So if you have second-level artifacts, you're welcome to come. And this is a separate token of gratitude from all of us.</text></string>
<string id="ecolog_apparat_rf_done_4"><text>That's better. If I have extra artifacts I'll come by.</text></string>
