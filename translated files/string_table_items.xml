<string id="mil_rjaboi_letter_desc"><text>So this crap happened... The Zone sees everything. How you act is how it'll treat you.\nRyaby and I had been partners for a long time. Some guy tried to stick with us—we brushed him off. We believed you shouldn't tempt fate. Ryaby could sense anomalies from twenty meters away, and I could drop any mutant in a heartbeat. Had to happen like this. I thought, just a couple more raids and that's it, home. To Ryabinsk...\nThat time we managed to reach the City Center. Took a decent haul. It's just a shame we couldn't get the legendary Compass, even though the tip was solid... That art allows you to use tunnels to reach any place in the Zone. Traders would pay so much for it you could clear out across the border immediately... and then spend the rest of your life lounging on the Canaries. But what's the point now...\nWe were returning through the reserve, the Red Forest. To stay out of sight. And then, I see Ryaby looking at me... wrong. And I realized, he wants to grab it all for himself. Or maybe I just imagined it. We'd been "treating" ourselves heavily for radiation back then. Well, anyway... I drop any mutant in a heartbeat... What could he do against me... He didn't have time... I was first.\nOnly now. I've paid. Took one step back. And fell right in. A Springboard. Better if I'd died there... But I crawled out. How? I don't remember. That's all...\n\nLet all the evil that was pass away. Your life is ending and THERE you will be happy, for you realized what makes a human a human. Though the man never gave his name, it doesn't matter. THERE everyone is equal.\n\nAmen.</text></string>

Had a strange feeling, like someone was trailing me the whole way to the adit... reached the spot, still amazed at how easy the path was... as if some unknown helpers had already cleared out all the mutants... And I found the promised reward quickly... a "Clear Sky" suit, there was a faction like that in the Zone once... Papers... collected everything and headed for the exit... Then I hear something starting to howl, like a draft... thought the wind picked up... If only... a "Whirligig" right at the entrance, dead center... So powerful there's no way to squeeze through... This isn't a coincidence... the Zone can't just toss something like this. Bad luck happens, but not like this... Someone was waiting for me... even found the artifact transformation recipe among the papers... it talks exactly about creating such an anomaly... I'd bet a hundred to one that the guy with the white eyes had something to do with it.</text></string>

<string id="vil_volk_letter"><text>Wolf's Note</text></string>
<string id="vil_volk_letter_desc"><text>So you decided to go for it after all. Didn't mind getting your hands dirty in the filth. Well then, listen up for the sake of learning: My mother was a teacher—strict but fair. She was so strict that in the school bathroom (where we usually shared one cigarette between three people), they recognized her by the clicking of her heels; after she bought silent shoes, they were genuinely terrified. But that's not the point. Late 70s, I'm sitting in the back row, drawing (the kindergarten was closed for quarantine, no one to leave me with). Mom is teaching a "problem" class. They loved giving her the ones with the lowest grades and the worst family situations. The lesson ends, Mom goes to take me to the cafeteria and discovers—her boots are gone! Those very ones, new winter boots that she'd saved up for for a long time. Tears and silent despair. The last "most problematic student" leaving noticed this. After clarifying the situation, he left. My mother and I just sat there—her in her indoor shoes, me clutching my coloring book. The bell rings for the next class—that same "problem" student walks in with a triumphant look and hands my mom a bag... with her boots. As it turned out, because of his "problematic" nature, the boy quickly figured out who, where, to whom, and why. He ran off, took them back, and gave them a beating while the trail was hot. Why did he return them? He said, "you can't rip off your favorite teacher." That's how they are, the loyal "problem" ones. Satisfied with the "treasure" you found, pup? Maybe you want to keep looking? There are plenty of latrines in the Zone. You should have used your head first: would I really hide anything valuable in a place like this... \nActually, if I catch you, I'll strangle you.</text></string>
<string id="vil_volk_letter2"><text>Note from Wolf's Stash</text></string>
<string id="vil_volk_letter2_desc"><text>Petruha, I always knew you were a stubborn guy, especially if someone makes you mad. That's why I decided to leave a few messages for you in my "stashes." Look, I said some things in the heat of the moment back then—don't hold a grudge. And that first note I wrote... I wasn't myself, basically. Don't go running straight to Sidor to sell my artifacts. Better find me at the Warehouses; we'll sit down with a bottle or two and talk like human beings. And bring that container with you, alright? I'll definitely share the loot with you; you've helped me so much. I'll be waiting for you at the fork where the road to the Barrier starts.\nWolf</text></string>

<string id="gluzov_letter_name"><text>Letter from Gluzov</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_letter_desc"><text>Greetings, Marked One!\nFinally, an opportunity arose to drop you a few lines. I don't know how long my letter will take to reach you, but I hope you receive it.\n
First, I want to thank you once again for everything you've done for me. My presentation at the conference was well-received, and I've already received several very tempting offers from the largest research institutes in Europe.\n
Second, remembering my promise, I tried to make inquiries about an institution outside the Zone where they could help you recover your memory. I learned about it from a colleague who worked with Professor Sakharov at Yantar.
It's called the "Center for Advanced Zone Research" and is unofficially overseen by the Professor personally. Their main profile is anomalous formations—artifacts—but in reality, they are "jacks of all trades" out of boredom.
My colleague mentioned that among other things, they deal with the rehabilitation of field expedition staff injured in the Zone, but with the right connections—backed by a tidy sum of money—they might take an outsider for treatment.\n
Anyway, I wanted to try to get you in there, but after talking to people in the know, I changed my mind. I won't bore you with unnecessary details, I'll just say that things with this Center are not as pleasant as they seem at first glance.
According to the information I received, several stalkers have been taken there, supposedly for treatment. However, in all that time, not a single one of them has ever been discharged. What happened to them is unknown, but rumors... varied rumors are circulating.\n
On the other hand, for money and with a recommendation from respected people, they could register you not as an ordinary stalker, but, say, as a freelance employee, but... is it worth the risk? I believe it is not.\n
Whatever the case, I will continue to look for alternative options. I'm sure there are plenty of private clinics ready, for an extra fee, to admit a patient in... semi-legal status. As I understand it, you don't have any documents at all, do you?\n
Regardless, everything is solvable as long as there's money. I'll contact you when I find something suitable, but for now... I know you aren't sitting idly by yourself and are trying various ways to regain your memory, so I'll ask Ivan Sergeyevich to provide you with any possible scientific assistance, should you need it.\n
On the back of the sheet, I'll leave a small message for him. Give this letter to I.S. after reading it, and he will help you. This is the least I can do for you right now.\n
Best regards, S. Gluzov.
