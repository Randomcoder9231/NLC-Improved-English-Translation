<string id="Duty"><text>Duty faction</text></string>
<string id="enc_social_military_army"><text>Regular army soldiers. They guard the entrances to the closed territory of the Zone, patrolling the perimeter, shooting mutants, and catching looters. \nArmy Spetsnaz are elite units. As a rule, they are deployed in the Zone to conduct rescue and special operations.</text></string>
<string id="enc_social_military_milstalkers"><text>Soldiers who have undergone special training after serving in the Zone, or stalkers who have signed a contract with the army. They are usually supplied with a large amount of auxiliary equipment and are well-armed. They are mainly used to study the causes and consequences of the catastrophe, as well as to map the Zone. They can travel either alone or in groups of up to five people. They don't let ordinary stalkers get close — they open fire immediately.</text></string>
<string id="enc_social_scientists_mobile-groups"><text>Deleted</text></string>
<string id="enc_social_scientists_mobile-labs"><text>A mobile laboratory looks like a small metal bunker with tiny tinted windows. It is capable of withstanding almost all types of damage known to man. It can be switched to fully autonomous mode for several months, for which it is equipped with reliable life-support systems. It is delivered to the Zone by cargo helicopter. Laboratory personnel never let outsiders past the outer airlock, so no stalker has ever made it inside.</text></string>
<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_bandits"><text>Members of the criminal world who came to the Zone for various reasons: to make money selling artifacts, to hide from the law, or to buy and sell weapons. There are plenty of such elements in the Zone, ranging from petty punks to serious career criminals. For the most part, they are organized into gangs. Although there is still no single bandit organization in the Zone, they greatly harass regular stalkers.</text></string>
<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_duty"><text>A clearly paramilitary group distinguished by strict discipline: its members live practically by the book. They are the only ones who don't trade the Zone's unique creations with the outside world; rumor has it that all artifacts found by Duty members are handed over to scientists. Every Duty member considers it their main goal to protect the world from the influence of the Zone. Most of the faction's operations involve exterminating monsters, so Duty raids often rid regular stalkers of many pressing problems. They have long been in a fierce feud with the Freedomers.</text></string>
<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_freedom"><text>Anarchists and daredevils who have declared themselves fighters for freedom within the Zone, and thus are in constant conflict with army units, military stalkers, and the Duty faction. Freedomers believe that information about what is happening in the Zone should not be hidden from humanity, thereby challenging the government organizations' monopoly on the local secrets and wonders.</text></string>
<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_killers"><text>The most mysterious and secretive faction in the Zone, whose existence many don't even believe in. Someone is constantly using the services of mercenaries: professionals in their field, they can quickly deal with any stalker and can even completely wipe out a small group. For their services, they apparently charge substantial sums in money or artifacts. The location of this group's base remains a mystery; obviously, it is located somewhere deep within the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_loners"><text>Stalkers who explore the Zone alone. They are the majority, as membership in a faction takes up precious time, thereby reducing earnings; furthermore, some are simply inclined toward solitude and independence by nature.</text></string>
<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_monolith"><text>A group that more closely resembles a religious sect. Its members believe that at the center of the Zone lies an evolutionary crystal — the Monolith — of extraterrestrial origin. Most stalkers despise the Monolith adepts, considering them lunatics. Since its formation, the group has hindered the progress of stalkers toward the center of the Zone, citing the latter's ill intentions regarding the Monolith. Rumor has it the Monolithians have a large base somewhere closer to the center of the Zone, but no one knows its exact location except the members of the faction themselves.</text></string>
<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_zomstalkers"><text>Those who have been exposed to long-term radiation from emitters at Yantar or certain other sectors. Careless stalkers quickly lose their minds, turning into wandering semi-corpses. Many of them roam the Zone, and some even reach the perimeter. One way or another, it's impossible to help them: the process of personality destruction is irreversible. Although zombified stalkers can still use their weapons, they are quite stupid. Upon meeting them, you can hear them mumbling fragments of phrases under their breath, which, however, are completely devoid of meaning. Over time, zombified stalkers completely lose all previous skills and turn into zombies. As a rule, they are very aggressive and pose a serious threat in significant numbers.</text></string>
