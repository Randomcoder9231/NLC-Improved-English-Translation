<string id="enc_steroids_black"><text>Combat stimulants have been known for a very long time. Even ancient Vikings, before battle, drank an infusion of beer and fly agaric mushrooms to not feel pain in combat and enter a "berserker" state, a warrior-demon who possessed incredible strength and endurance. Berserkergang, though called battle frenzy, was considered the highest warrior valor. At all times, there were various types of combat stimulants, and this type is a representative of the latest generation. The "Black Speed" stimulator is a mixture of powerful narcotic pain relievers, anti-shock, and hormonal drugs used in sports medicine as a fast-acting doping agent, as well as in military special forces, where its use is strictly regulated. Its use is permitted as a last resort in extreme situations when it is necessary to mobilize all body resources for a short time. Officially, the stimulator is called Combined Stimulating Drug of the sixth generation ("KSP-6"), but among special forces soldiers who have experienced its effects, the name "Black Speed" is much more common. People who have used this substance explain such an exotic name by the drug's properties. First, the user becomes an uncontrollable death machine, feeling no pain, fear, or blows, possessing the strength of several people. After the effect wears off (i.e., after a few minutes), the reckoning comes. The exhausted body resources require recovery; there is a drop in blood pressure, shallow breathing, and bradycardia. Brief loss of consciousness is possible. Complete rest is required for several days after use; otherwise, sudden headaches, seizures, sudden jumps in blood pressure - both downward and upward - are possible, which often leads to heart attacks and strokes even in young people. Officially, KSP-6 is a prohibited drug, but it can still be found on the black market. Rumor has it that its production is still ongoing for use by special forces groups.</text></string>

<string id="kontroler_diary_1_part_1"><text>June 29, 198.. (year erased)\n \nThey brought us in today. Just as the rumors said, they're keeping us underground... Bastards! I'd rather have faced the death penalty... Although no one asked us, they played it out perfectly. The suddenly discovered new circumstances of the case, and a new article in the code about political prisoners. And when that bald guy started his heartfelt speeches about voluntary help to science... They're all bastards! No one had a choice – execution or here, I don't know where... Well, let's see what kind of science they have here.\n \nJuly 12\n \nIt seems I was wrong! They not only gave us food but also individual cells! True, they observe us around the clock... But they listen to every request. When I asked for it, they instantly brought me a pencil and paper, and Nikolsky was allowed to listen to recordings of some favorite rock band of his! He's an idiot, of course, heh-heh... If it weren't for those recordings, he wouldn't have been caught for speculation... I wonder why he, a speculator, was sent with us, political prisoners?\n \nAugust 1\n \nAfter almost two months, everything is starting to clear up. We are doomed... These scoundrels are conducting experiments here worse than Hitler's doctors in concentration camps. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE IN OUR COUNTRY?! Today, Nikolsky was brought back after the experiments.... They dragged him past my cell, and he lifted his head, looked at me... GOD!!! Those were not human eyes! What did they do to him? He wasn't looking at me, no, he was looking THROUGH me, INTO me!!! Blood was flowing from his mouth... A stain on the floor in front of the cell...\n \nAugust 2\n \nI barely slept all night... The screams from behind the wall don't sound human... I asked the guard for a drink, and incredibly, they brought me vodka in a plastic cup, like on airplanes. The guard asked me not to tell anyone... He looked unwell himself. May your memory be bright, Nikolsky. May your soul rest while your body still screams in the next cell...\n \nAugust 24\n \nThat's it. Now it's my turn. Today, they explained the essence of my experiment. Some "generator" will irradiate me until they notice changes. In response to my question, what if I die before the changes? They replied that these are "insignificant interferences to the experiment." I lunged at one of them; I wanted to grab the keys to the exit... My head hurts so much... The guard, the one who brought me vodka, gave me a bandage to dab the wound after the baton. He took the bandage back so no one would see it on me. But he's still a good guy. His name is Volodya.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_1_part_2"><text>September 10\n \nIt's getting harder to write. My fingers don't bend... They seem to have gotten stronger - I broke a food bowl three days ago. And I think I bit through an aluminum spoon - I don't remember... Tomorrow will be the psi emitter again - that's what that thing in the main hall is called... I'm alone now. Nikolsky was lucky - he only screamed for two days before he died. Most of my comrades suffered longer... I'm the last... They say - I'm not like them, I'm special...\n \nSeptember 13\n \nNot a human anymore. Better, stronger. I'm big. A rat. They gave it to me. I don't like the rat. Rats. I don't like them. It tried to bite. I didn't let it. I made it run on the ceiling and walls. Made it without hands. I thought about it to run in its head, and it ran where I wanted. And then I stopped thinking, and it fell right onto the floor from the ceiling. I walked over and thought for it not to move. And stepped on it. I don't like rats. Dirty. They stood and watched. The cell is small. And I'm big.\n \nOctober 1\n \nRats. They give me many rats. I make them all run and fall. And a dog, too. It's also like a rat. I think for it, and I see what it sees. I don't like rats. The dog likes them. I thought for the dog in its head to eat rats. And I thought for the rats not to move. And the dog ate. Delicious... Too bad I'm not a dog. I'm big.\n \nOctober 13\n \nThey don't know about me anymore. They say they've studied me. They're stupid. I was in their heads. I saw. They didn't see me. Volodya... One of them. He's weaker. He feels sorry. He was kind to me. I'll take him first. And I'll think for him to open the cell. And then I'll think for him to kill the second one, who was silent. He's strong; it's hard to think through his head. The others are weak. Not like Volodya, but weak. The ones who wrote and studied, weaker. They are the main ones. But weak. I'll take them all. They are like rats and dogs.\n \nOctober 20\n \nIt's better in the forest. There are mushrooms here. I remember eating mushrooms once. And they remember too. But they don't speak anymore. They moo and cry. And Volodya isn't here. He's not a rat. He's better. I was hungry. Delicious... They think I'm big. Yes. That's right. I'm big.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_2_part_1"><text>January 29\n \nToday the mailman brought an envelope. It bore the seal of the Kiev Research Institute of Neurosurgery. Upon opening it, I saw the response to my inquiry, I quote:\nDear Anton Anatolievich. We have reviewed your dissertation, as well as a number of your articles regarding the development of science in the field of neurosurgery, and also your article "on the effects of psi-radiation on the organism and human capabilities". We are pleased to inform you that one of our laboratories is recruiting new qualified personnel, and we would be happy to see you in the main building of our ...the record is illegible...\n \nFebruary 16\n \nSo here we are, brought to the laboratory. Surprisingly, I don't remember how we traveled. I seemed to have gotten enough sleep before the journey, but when we got on the bus and it left the Institute grounds, I began to feel drowsy and fell completely asleep. The last thing I remember is my companion, I think it was Mikhail, telling me about his presentation in Berlin at a scientific conference. I wonder how long we traveled? An hour? Two? I still haven't encountered any clocks inside the laboratory. I've completely lost track of time. Is it day or night now? We left at 6 AM. I think we couldn't have gone far from the Institute, surely it's somewhere on the outskirts of Kiev. Maybe in one of the neighboring towns. Soon our group will go through orientation, and we'll be able to see the entire laboratory.\n \nFebruary 17\n \nYesterday, we went through a safety briefing in the auditorium. How tiresome this is... You feel like a student on a practicum. Don't take that, don't touch this. Has someone among us really still not remembered this? They just announced a gathering of all newcomers in the auditorium; most likely, they'll show slides and conduct a tour.\n \nFebruary 18\n \nThe tour was impressive! The laboratory is simply enormous! They even have the most modern equipment; apparently, the articles about psi-radiation by many of our scientists are still of interest to someone. But something about the laboratory made me uneasy. Despite the fact that everything in laboratories should always be clean, everything looked too polished. It felt as if before our arrival they had brought in cleaning ladies from the Metropol Hotel, and they, as always, cleaned everything down to the tiniest speck...</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_2_part_2"><text>February 23\n \nWe thought that at least on this day they'd let us out to breathe some fresh air and look around the area, but no such luck. As I managed to find out, we're guarded by a platoon of soldiers. Though I don't understand why they need to guard us at all. From whom? I thought that at least on such a holiday, dear to every soldier, they would agree to let us out for a couple of minutes, but they were impartial.\n \nMarch 4\n \nToday is my first birthday that I'll be celebrating not in my familiar home environment, but among my new family. Colleagues congratulated me on the holiday since morning. Though they didn't give any gifts, but that's understandable - how would they buy them, being in complete isolation from the outside world?\nIt's still unclear what my responsibilities will include. I learned from our senior research associate, Gubarev Vitaly Semyonovich, that soon they should bring people who voluntarily agreed to serve science.\n \nMarch 10\n \nThey brought the first volunteers. My God, these are just ordinary prisoners. It's hard to even call them volunteers. What kind of volunteer would they bring to us in shackles?\n \nApril 16\n \nA month has already passed since we began work with the "volunteers". Our department's task is preparing equipment. After they brought these prisoners, we were denied access to most of the laboratory rooms. We don't even cross paths with the prisoners. At least we're thankful they provide us with everything necessary.\n \nApril 19\n \nLord, where have I ended up? Cursed be the day when I, enticed by the possibility of career advancement, agreed to come here. Today, something happened in the laboratory. They locked us on the floor and posted two soldiers with assault rifles, supposedly to guard us. We didn't hear anything, and this frightened us even more. We tried, as before, to carry out our work pretending nothing had happened, but it was all in vain. We understood that there, downstairs, something was happening. I wish I hadn't learned the truth! Even in facilities of heightened secrecy, rumors spread quickly. One of the test subjects (I can no longer call them volunteers! Who am I lying to? Myself?) became uncontrollable and either took hostages or began controlling several of our staff members. As it turned out, we're not just guarded by a platoon of soldiers, but ...page torn out...</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_2_part_3"><text>May 16\n \nIt seems all my letters and requests to be relieved from my post are either not being read or aren't leaving the lab at all. I can't work here anymore. I’m getting thoughts of sabotage and diversion. I'm ready to do anything just to get out of here as soon as possible. I've never been afraid of enclosed spaces, but I feel like that phobia is growing in me every day. When I wrote about psi-emissions in my work, I meant a completely different kind of influence, one that was obtained by emitting ultra-small doses to specific parts of the brain. But these butchers are irradiating the entire brain with an emission that not a single normal person can withstand. I heard that the one who controlled the two scientists was the second mutant, only the second one. The first one died three minutes after the onset of mutational changes in the brain. His head just cracked open like a walnut. Do they not understand what they're doing? These prisoners were people, too... and what if they soon run out of these poor wretches? Who will they bring here? Homeless people? And what then? No, I must get out of here at any cost and tell the whole world the truth!\n \nMay 21\n \nGod, I'm going crazy! I feel like someone is in my head! I don't get it. Sometimes there are sudden bouts of headache, then they change into a noise in my head. Sometimes I feel like I hear some kind of squeak! It lasts only a couple of seconds, and then a new headache begins! Have they completely lost their minds? Are they really starting to test these emissions on their own employees? What kind of doses are they using? I've never heard of such effects from radiation!\n \nMay 27\n \nAfter another emergency, we were locked on the floor. Four hours have passed, and still no news. This time, they didn't leave any soldiers with us, and thank God. Because the previous meatheads looked at us like potential enemies, it felt like they were holding something back...\n \nMay 29\n \nD-damn! Damn! Damn! We've been locked up for two days now. I hear someone outside wandering around, but no one responds to our shouts. We're gonna run out of food soon. We were supposed to be given fresh food for each floor yesterday. Some of my colleagues are starting to panic; we're trying to calm them down, but we're succeeding less and less. The attacks now happen almost every time we start to call for help (are they building up a reflex in us or what?)... \n \nMay 30\n \nThe food is gone, no more than 2 liters of water are left... the farthest office, which we decided to make a toilet, stinks up the whole floor so much that it's impossible to breathe anymore... We tried to break down the iron doors. We broke a massive table, but we still didn't open the door... there's no one walking behind the door anymore, and that's even scarier. We don't know when the lights will be turned off, and that scares us more and more...</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_2_part_4"><text>May 31\n \nIt's one of our colleague's birthday. When we went to congratulate him, he was hanging in a noose. We tried to save him, but he'd been there for a while, and all our attempts to fight for his life were in vain. A little later, we noticed Mikhailov was missing. He had gone to the toilet. When we went into the office, he was lying on the floor. Most likely, it was a heart attack. We laid both colleagues in the same office.\n \nUnknown date\n \nThe lights went out in the lab, and the dial that showed the date and time is no longer lit. I'm writing by feel. My head's empty of thoughts now. We realized that we are all doomed here, and no one will look for us. I finally figured out the reason for the cleanliness during the tour and why there were so many vacant spots in the lab. It's not about creating a new wing in the lab, and it's not that this is a young project. It's that we were all initially condemned, just like the previous group of scientists. They also failed the experiment and all died. Only those who led the experiment survived. Those who always get out of any situation squeaky clean... My grandpa called them staff rats! And he was damn right. But here we are all rats... lab rats... people who voluntarily agreed to sacrifice ourselves for science...</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_3_part_1"><text>"Letters prohibited from being sent or those that were returned"\n \nPrivate Petrenko\n \nMy dearest mother! I'm writing to you after 2 months of service! I don't regret for a second that I signed a contract to serve in the Exclusion Zone. Our company is stationed at the local research institute called Agroprom. During my service, I've already managed to do a detail, and yesterday I started night duty. The service here is a cinch; there's no hazing, as Senior Lieutenant Khadzhinov maintains iron discipline. Don't worry about the radiation; this research institute was completely decontaminated and cleared of radioactive particles in '86. The background radiation in the territory doesn't exceed the norm, and outside the institute, it's about 200-300 µR/h. Tell Petka that as soon as my contract ends, I'll be sure to bring him some kind of souvenir. There are some interesting things here; they're called artifacts. Some are radioactive, and there are those that, despite being in a contaminated area, protect from radiation. Some of our guys even tried to make such artifacts themselves. To do this, you had to throw some ingredients into a special place, an anomaly, and after a while, all this mush becomes a super-dense, durable compound with special qualities. My sheet of paper is running out, and I don't know what else to write. Don't worry about me, Mom! Just 10 more months and I'll be back! I promise to write to you once every 2 months. I can't do it more often. By the way, this is the second letter I'm sending, and you're not replying. Your Sasha.\n \nReason: unintentional attempt to disclose a military secret, Zone propaganda.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_3_part_2"><text>Sergeant Tikhonyuk\n \nHey Kostik! Strangely, you got my letter so late. It probably got lost in the mail, and they couldn't find it for a long time. I'm very glad you liked the photo I sent with the letter. Last time, I really forgot to mention who was standing next to me. If you look from left to right, first there's Petya Brovun, then Sashka Petrenko (he's new with us, only 3 months), on the right is me, as you've already guessed, and sitting in front of us is Vitalik Dmitriev. He was taken to the infirmary yesterday. He, Junior Lieutenant Zubko, and Sergeant Nechaev were on a night patrol of the area around our research institute. And wouldn't you know it, a Swamp Bloodsucker attacked them. And the mutant turned out to be quick, judging by Vitalik's stories. A dash out of the bushes at night, it grabbed Nechaev, and dashed back into the bushes. After a while, it dashed out of the bushes again and latched onto Zubko. And Vitalik Dmitriev, though not faint of heart, had never seen anything like it, a living person having their soul sucked out right before his eyes. Well, he got scared. He rushed back, even losing his helmet along the way. But the Bloodsucker still caught up with him right near the gates. Oh, if it hadn't been for Antokha Sedykh, I don't even know what would have happened to Vitalik. But our sniper on the watchtower can hit a squirrel in the eye, and a Bloodsucker, or even a Fleshette in its button-eye, he'll still not miss. And I don't know how he did it, but he pierced the Bloodsucker without even hitting his comrade! So that's the story. Born lucky, nothing else for it! Tomorrow they're sending us to patrol the area near Cordon. The stalkers have gotten completely brazen; they've made holes in the barbed wire and are prowling around like it's a highway. Waiting for your reply, buddy! My apologies for telling you such news, but in our Zone, there's no politics or economy. So I have to write these, almost criminal, news stories. Vityok\n \nP.S. I still can't shake the feeling that our letters are being read by someone before they're sent. That's probably the reason why not all the letters reached you.\n \nReason: unintentional attempt to disclose a military secret, attempt to disclose confidential information to a third party.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_3_part_3"><text>Private Nikodimov\n \nHey, bro! I got your letter and decided to write you back right away while I've got some free time. I'm doing alright, serving like everyone else. It's just that my health has been acting up lately. I've been getting viral infections a lot recently; the flu in winter just wouldn't leave me alone. The doctors say it's because I got exposed near an anomaly during the last patrol. But I don't believe them. Those stalkers spend several hours near anomalies when they're cooking up artifacts; they aren't even afraid to sleep near them, but I was only near a Whirligig for an hour. I think it's all because of what they injected me with at the end of autumn... some scientists came by, we call 'em eggheads among ourselves (their suits are funny). So these nerds chose a few people for some unclear reason, and I was one of 'em, and they did a so-called "vaccination." After that, they started taking us to the doctor every day to check up on us, they ask how we're feeling, and they even feed us better than the others. Recently, the eggheads took two guys from our vaccinated group away with them. I still don't get why? But they were having frequent headaches and back pain. Maybe they took them away to treat them? But it's weird, our research institute's infirmary seems to be the most modernly equipped in the whole Zone. Maybe they're holding something back. But I won't give up on them that easily, my body is strong, I won't get sick like they did! I promise, bro! Say hi to all our family. I don't have long left, just 3 more months, and my contract will be over.\n \nReason: deliberate attempt to disclose a top-secret experiment and inform third parties about it.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_3_part_4"><text>Private Tsybenko\n \nHello, mom! I'm writing to you right after returning from a mission. I've only served here for a month, but I already horribly regret my decision. Mom, today I killed a person for the first time. Although the people who wander around here sometimes barely resemble the people I'm used to seeing back in our village. They're more like soulless machines who are ready to kill for any shiny object... They're like magpies, gathering everything that glitters and is badly stowed. They're ready to tear each other apart for a small glowing rock, for a bottle of vodka, for a bundle of grenades, even for sneakers. They're not people anymore. They're worse than the wolves my dad and I used to hunt. But this stalker. He had so much more humanity in him than all of our guys put together. He was walking, all wounded, towards Cordon, barely dragging his rifle behind him. At first, we thought about letting him pass; our lieutenant ordered him to drop his weapon, grumbling under his breath that he wasn't long for this world anyway and wouldn't need it. But then he suddenly looked at us with a gaze full of pain, a pain that was tearing him apart inside... he was begging to be saved, to be freed from this torment. Vitka Tikhonyuk told me that it looked like he was mutating from the inside, that he was being torn apart by hellish pain, and that he would be better off if we didn't let him pass. He seemed to hear the sergeant's words and tried to raise his rifle, aiming it at us. The lieutenant gave the order to shoot to kill, and I, like the other soldiers, put my eye to the sight of my rifle and pulled the trigger. I don't know why I shot. There were plenty of shooters around without me. In a matter of seconds, we turned a living person into a bloody mess. A few of our rookie guys asked the lieutenant to go up to the stalker, but the very thought of what he would look like up close made me sick. The lieutenant just smiled and said that all normal people have this kind of reaction the first time, and to those daredevils who wanted to get a closer look, he replied that they'll have plenty of time during their service to see worse. And after, I wanted to drop everything and go back to our village. I miss your pies terribly, and fresh cow's milk in the morning. But the money I'll get from serving in the Zone, you know, how much we need it. With that money, you'll have your surgery, we'll make it, we'll definitely have time to cure your illness before it starts to get worse. Kisses, Mom! And don't worry about me! I'm strong, I'll endure!\n \nReason: Tsybenko Valentina Alekseevna no longer resides at the address village Polyanskoye, house 35.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_4_part_1"><text>Day One.\n \nToday is my first time going into the Zone on a raid! The locals say a raid is a sortie for something valuable. The person who gave me the order explained that to learn how to survive here, one raid isn't enough. But this one's a test. Stone Flower... I wonder what that is? He showed me a blurry picture; I couldn't make out what was on it. Some lines, flashes... Multicolored lights. But he explained that when I find this thing, I won't confuse it with anything else. Stone Flower... I feel like a master craftsman! Oh well. He promised good money, and also said there'd be a bonus for speed. This guy seems to be a local bigwig—where else would he get so much stuff in his bunker?\n \nDay Two.\n \nI'm alive. That's the main thing—and a couple of hours ago, I might not have survived. I can't believe I made it out... Some creature, there, in the hollow, probably the size of a tank, rushed at me from the darkness. How did I manage to get the rifle off my shoulder??? That's army training for ya... And I thought two years went to waste. When I get back, I'll light the biggest candle for Sergeant Krivtsov's health. Although there's probably no church close by here... Oh well, I'll drink to his good health—the bastard taught me how to shoot... And now I won't hang the rifle on my shoulders. It's more peaceful with the barrel in my hands, even if it's a little uncomfortable.\n \nDay Three.\n \nI found it!!! Everything was just like the guy in the bunker said!!! It... the Flower... It's beautiful, I've never seen such beauty!!! I held it in my hands for a long time, and it was glowing... So this is what artifacts are like. It's almost a shame to give it away—it's my first success after all. Okay, time to go back.\n \nDay Six.\n \nThings are bad. Almost no ammo, and I think I'm lost. The places seem familiar; I remember that hill, those three trees near the well... But something has changed, as if... I don't know. And on the way back, different creatures are attacking me. Most of them are small, but they're agile—I used up all my buckshot. All I have left is birdshot, size five. If something bigger than a dog attacks—I'm screwed.\n \nDay Six, evening.\n \nAnother huge creature rushed at me! It was waiting for me in an ambush!!! Just like the one at night when I first came here! I'll never forget that snarling snout and the fangs... It's strange, but this beast looks like a boar. Only it's huge, and it has lots of fangs; I didn't have time to count. Or maybe it just seemed that way out of fear? I don't know. It rushed at me so fast, and I just froze. I was paralyzed!!! I just watched it fly at me, and suddenly... It was like it hit an invisible barrier—the creature was thrown into the air, then spun around, and then... GOD, I could have been in its place! So the stories in the camp about anomalies are true. Damn, where did I end up!??\n \nDay Seven.\n \nIn the morning, I thought I saw a person. Probably a hallucination—there can't be an unarmed person in jeans here... And his head was huge. Maybe it's from the "Stone Flower"—my hands are red, my neck, my back is terribly itchy. Maybe it's radioactive? Everything's swimming before my eyes... And a noise in my ears, like a voice... I must have been poisoned... I just need to get there faster. Where am I?\n \nDay Seven. Evening.\n \nIt's hard to talk... This person... He's following me, he's been following me the whole time... And once I saw his face. So close, but he was far away. How can that be? A noise in my ears... He's the one talking, his voice is like the sound of the wind... And a whistle... No, he's not a person, he's... Something else... He knows where I'm hiding... My hands aren't listening...\n \nFinal entry. (Noise, crackle)\n \n... Let go... (noise)... I... I need to go home... It's dark... Very dark... Big one, let go... Or die... That would be better... He... Won't let me leave... I have a pistol... ammo... one... just gotta make it work... let go... no... don't interfere... that's it... (Sound of a gunshot. Noise, crackle. Record breaks off.)</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_5_part_1"><text>Report No. 25-19-12u.\n \nI did it! I'm going there, to the Zone! The whole lab congratulated me today, even Senior Researcher Kovalyov. Even though he doesn't like me much, he came up, shook my hand, and said: "Congratulations, comrade Pankov!" To be fair, his smile wasn't sincere—that was uncalled for. But still… I'm happy! I'll see the places where most of our research objects are delivered from. Maybe I'll even finish my scientific work this year!\n \nOnce I was here, it turned out to be completely different from what I expected. Most of the scientific instruments are completely unfamiliar to me. Semyonov—the assistant to the head of the lab and also the head of ML-4 (mobile camp), says that they're of local production and contain some local artifacts. This is amazing! How far science has advanced here in the Zone!\n \nToday was a tough day. We barely managed to get away from a facility that unexpectedly turned on. Semyonov was taking measurements of the emission intensity, and I was reporting the results over the radio to Kruglov (he's another senior researcher; he seemed to me a bit overconfident...), when suddenly the sensor went off the charts. We barely got away with our lives. The ground shook as if a volcano had woken up under the factory building! What kind of facility is capable of that? What kind of power does it have!?? Semyonov said if I want to understand what's happening here, I need to climb higher and look at the factory's territory through binoculars. I wonder why? Or was he kidding?</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_5_part_2"><text>This is the first time I've been really scared. I followed Semyonov's advice... I climbed a tall tree, taking binoculars with me. And I looked at what was happening on the factory grounds, in the inner courtyard... My God, there are people there!!! They're walking in circles, like sleepwalkers! Some of them are wearing scientists' clothes, and a few seem to be wounded... What's wrong with them? Why can't they leave? I have to find a way to help them. Semyonov and Kruglov left somewhere today, saying it wouldn't be for long. Too bad, that means I'll go alone. I need to take a lot of medkits for the wounded scientists in there. And probably a weapon. To be fair, I've only ever shot a pneumatic rifle in a shooting gallery. Oh well, better to have it just in case.\n \nI'm in ambush not far from the factory, on the roof of some workshop. It's unbelievable, but the people are obeying some kind of monster, bipedal and upright!!! This parody of a human is wearing jeans! It's hard to write—the psi-emission must be affecting my coordination. It's a good thing the facility isn't working right now—I checked. WAIT. So what's the psi-emission from then? WHAT IS HAPPENING? Could this monster be generating psi-waves? Then it's good that he didn't see me... I have to shoot him... The main thing is to hit him in the head; if I miss, I'm done for. The zombies (sadly, that's the only way to describe the stalkers and scientists around the monster... How horrible...) shoot wherever he points, and if I don't kill him right away, they'll just riddle me with bullets. But I have to try. It's my duty, for them, those unfortunates next to him...\n \nTo whoever finds and reads this...\n \nI'm wounded. I can't move—the bullet hit my spine... I can still write through the pain, but I may lose consciousness soon—if I'm lucky... Alas, I'm a lousy shot—I fired the whole clip and missed. I hear the monster climbing up to me, here. I have little time. He doesn't need me alive because I'm wounded—I saw him eat one of the zombies when he stepped into a hatch and broke his leg... I just hope it's quick... I'm scared. Goodbye. I did everything I could for these people.\n \nJunior Researcher Pankov.</text></string>

This will be Day 1, the day I arrived, after this it'll be dateless... \n \nDay 7.\nA week already... And time here runs faster than outside the Zone. Now it's not zone, but the Zone.\n \nDay 12.\nAlong with Siviy, Moshennik, and Tyufyak, we'll go on to the Garbage... Through the checkpoint...\n \nDay 13.\nDamn bandits... Shot me in the arm... Forearm... Man, it hurts so bad... I hate 'em...\n \nDay 15.\nFuckers! They killed him... THEY KILLED TYUFYAK!!! I'll kill all of 'em, without mercy or regret...\n \nDay 20.\nThe whole wound is swollen, it hurts, I need to go to the Bar, maybe they can help there... Damn, it hurts terribly... There's almost no food.\n \nDay 21.\nWe found some kind of... artifact. It radiates heat. Moshennik's counter showed that it's slightly radioactive, but the wound stopped hurting so much... That's good...\n \nDay 25.\nWe made it to the Duty checkpoint. At first, they wouldn't let us in, but as soon as they saw the wound, they quickly opened the gates.\n \nDay 26.\nThe doctor there says we'll have to hike to Sakharkov for medicine; he even gave us a guide, but we'll have to give the artifact to the scientists. What a shame, it's funny... wait, what am I saying? I'll give it up and it's no big deal...\n \nMoshennik got a job with the bartender, but Siviy... Siviy's gone...\n \nDay 30.\nSakharkov injected me with the medicine, it seems to be almost gone. He took the artifact, which turned out to be quite rare... Now I work for them, and they even gave me a hazmat suit. Now we'll be going to the local lab here. What's it called... oh, that's right! X-16!\n \nDay 32.\nCreepy... some kinda thing underground... an emitter... Zombies are here now... creepy...\n \nDay 60.\nA Snork bit me... It's strange, but I don't feel any pain!

<string id="kontroler_diary_7_part_1"><text>(BEGINNING OF RECORDING)\n \n"...he's a bastard, but whatever, I can't drag all this loot to Sidorovich, and I don't know any other fence-traders. I've got enough cash for ammo for now.\nThe Bar is the oasis of the Zone. People are constantly coming and going, there are hardly any bandits or mutants, Duty hunts them down, because their base is right here too.\nRight. One more shot, and then to bed. And the stalkers are heading to the Arena, they want a show...\n \nUgh... another gloomy morning. Though, as they say, stalkers don't drink—stalkers are healing. But I remember the whole conversation I had with one guy, Lisy, maybe... He was talking about the Yantar factory, about the 'tadpole' camp on the lake, about how much money they'll shell out for even the most worthless Stone Flower, and for modifications they're almost ready to rip their shirts off. What can ya do—they're fanatics... of science. The only downside is the psi-emitter. I haven't met a zombie myself yet, but according to the veterans, it's not a pleasant sight. Lisy was saying that he once became such good pals with a stalker that he'd share loot and cover his back in a fight and drink vodka with him at the Bar, but a week ago, he met him on the way from Yantar (the guy had apparently gone on a solo raid). He said that he was walking like a wind-up toy, straight on, almost on the edge of the anomalies, muttering something under his breath and dragging his rifle on the ground. Lisy called out to him, and his buddy cut him down with a burst of fire until his magazine was empty. Well, Lisy figured out that his buddy had fried his brains at Yantar and turned into a zombie. In short, he had to take out his best pal with his own hands...\nIt's sad... To be honest, counting the money left after restocking on ammo, medkits, and grub makes it even sadder. What the hell, I'm heading towards Yantar tomorrow.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_7_part_2"><text>The Bartender said there's a road to Yantar through a railway siding, or whatever you call it... The truth is, there's a ton of anomalies there—I'd better pick up some more bolts and nuts.\n \nWhat a stroke of luck! I got to the bridge on the way to Yantar without meeting a single mercenary. Though I had to take a huge detour because a Bloodsucker was lurking near the boxcars by the platform. Good thing I spotted it in time. And when I got under the bridge, my jaw dropped—the air was flowing all through the passage, like from a hot iron roof on a summer day. I'd never seen so many Burners! It took me almost an hour to get through. I used up a bunch of bolts to check for anomalies. But, I did get my hands on some artifacts: 3 Fireballs and 5 of some kind of pear-shaped curlicues. Now for a smoke break, I'm sitting in the shade, watching the road... Who's that coming?\n \nSo this is what Yantar is like... A huge workshop on a hill, a swamp with a shot-down chopper, the scientists' bunker, where I'm holed up—and silence. And Lisy didn't lie, the main scientist, Sakharov, I think, when he saw my loot, his eyes lit up. He took all the artifacts and shelled out a ton of cash. I've never made this much on a single raid! Though he wouldn't let me into the bunker, saying it's quarantine and radiation—but oh well, I can also take a breather on the roof, where the helipad is.\nIt's just spooky here. Quiet, only the Snorks rustling in the bushes, and the zombies... The first one I met was on the way to Yantar, when I set up a bivouac on the side of the road. He was in a black Duty jumpsuit, his left side burned as if he'd fallen into a bonfire or flown into a Burner, and his walk was a limp because one foot was dislocated or broken. I was hoping to wait it out until he passed, but that bastard somehow sensed where I was hiding and shot at me with a Makarov. I had to kill him, but until I blew his head off with a shotgun, he was still trying to get up—tough bastard. A horrible sight.\n \nTime to head back to the Bar. I'll get myself something worthwhile there, maybe I'll have enough for an Abakan, and I should change my suit. When I meet Lisy, I'll buy him a drink, thanks to him for the tip about the scientists.\nRight... Someone's coming down the hill, let's see who it...\n \n(loud low-frequency hum)\n \n... F-FUCK!!! WHAT IS THAT?!\n \nStep. Step. The road.\nForward. Forward.\nLoo... loo... loot...\nBar. The Bar... man...\nBartender.

Nasty scumbags, they told Blue that Cross-Eye was doing drugs in the ravine today and wasn't on duty. As always, Cross-Eye, those bitches...\nNow I'm trudging along, looking for a stalker with that fucking moron Waffle (don't forget to quietly off him, I'll tell Blue it was a patrol). Madman, Tattered... I don't remember his name. Blue said I gotta take a package from him, another fucking fag. He should go and take it himself...\n---\nToday we went through Agroprom, a nasty little place, the boys said there was a shitload of military here, but we only found one corpse. Impaled on a branch... Someone went to the trouble of impaling him that high. Gotta tell the boys to come check it out, a fun picture. Waffle keeps whining that his foot's chafed. We told him not to be cheap on the sneakers, but no—Waffle's the smartest one.\n---\nI broke the PDA screen, now I can only listen and talk. Waffle, the prick, is laughing... Oh well, I'll off him soon, I can't be dragging that scum back, can I?\n---\nWaffle's gone... damn, I thought I'd be the one to off him, but fate had other plans. While we were sleeping, a Bloodsucker sneaked up on us. What a nasty monstrosity. It lunged at Waffle, may his vile soul rest in pieces, and it mauled him like a dog with a hot water bottle, and he screamed... he screamed so much that I almost went crazy. I barely got away...\nAnd where am I now? Some kind of house, and nothing's clear. Where do I go?\n---\nBut I'll definitely be back, and when I return, I'll bury that bitch Fatso, and that fag Alyosha, and maybe even Blue. That damn house, how was I supposed to know it was a Fleshette lair? I barely got away, now I'm in some kind of forest...\n---\nI just have to make it back. The irony of fate... that stalker... we were cutting him up, and he looked at me and said I wouldn't make it back from the Zone... damn, his eyes...\n---\nNow I'm under some kind of snag. The PDA said there's an Emission soon, and there's not a single goddamn hollow here, just my luck.\n----\n(sound of an Emission)\nMy head hurts so much... and those eyes, stalker, forgive me if you can. When I get back, I'll pray for your soul...\n----\n(... beginning of recording corrupted ... sound of an Emission)\n... damn, I won't survive this day... my head hurts so bad...

<string id="kontroler_diary_9_part_1"><text>06:00\nUgh... Time to get up... Man, I told Tolik not to have that fifth bottle! My head's splitting... damn, I wish there was an artifact for hangovers!\n \n06:48\nAnd I'm almost broke! Not enough for armor plates! What a bastard Tolik is, "have a little bottle, have a little bottle"... Oh well! I heard Sidorovich wants to find something on the farm. I should go ask him, I've got a stash there anyway, I'll check on it at the same time.\n \n07:02\nI asked him about that farm... He says he needs, you see, a Flesh eye. Even though I've heard other stalkers talk about such orders, this is the first time I've run into one myself... Good thing it's not brains, or I'd have to do a trepanation (or whatever it's called). Oh well, I guess I can get ready now.\n \n07:15\nOh! I ran into Andrey the Scientist (and we heard he'd kicked the bucket somewhere). He found a Pseudodog's lair here. He says they can give you money for its tail, and good money too! So, I agreed with him, we'll take down the dog together.\n \n07:29\nWe decided to go through the ATP, even though they say there are bandits holed up there, but maybe we can slip past and they won't notice...\n \n07:53\nPhew! Good thing Andrey had a silent pistol, or they would've spotted us! What a bastard! He was sitting there so you couldn't see him right away!\n \n08:06\nWell, here's the tunnel, it seems this dog has made its home here, look at all the bones lying around! I'm kinda spooked, I've never seen these Pseudodogs before, I've shot the blind ones, but these...\n \n08:27\nWhat a beast! It was sitting there waiting for us to enter the tunnel! Ah, poor Andrey, he was a good stalker... Oh well, I've got the tail, now I gotta get back to the village.\n \n09:13\nI decided to go around the ATP. I'll go a little to the north; the main thing is that the military doesn't notice me... my head's started to hurt too.\n \n09:28\nOh my god! A Controller! Here! It can't be...\n \n09:35\nYep, it's him... Definitely him, eating something, and I can't go around...\n \n09:43\nI got it, I have a stash near the locomotive, there's a dynamite stick there. I can't throw it all the way to him, but I can distract him, maybe I'll have time to get around him.\n \n09:45\nPhew! I got around him! It didn't explode very well, of course... it must have gotten damp, oh well, at least he was distracted...\n \n09:46\nHm... And what if...\n \n09:48\nGot him! I hit him! I hit him!\n \n09:50\nWow... Taking down a Controller with a single shot from a TOZ! Not everyone can brag about that! And what's this? A PDA?\n \n09:53\nWell... See how it goes. The Zone...\n \n10:43\nNo kidding! Made it without any trouble. Sidorovich, the bastard, only gave me 7500 hryvnia for the tail! Well, at least he gave me some ammo.\n \n11:20\nI told them about the Controller, no one believed me... Ha! But when I let them listen to the recording on the PDA, everyone immediately quieted down, yeah! Well, that's it for today, a person can't be that lucky!\n \n09:27\nI feel kinda drowsy... Woke up so late... The military already changed the guard, and there was a fellow countryman there! I'll have to pay for passage, damn it...\n \n10:39\nI made it to the railway embankment without any trouble, paid 2500 for passage, what bloodsuckers!\n \n10:51\nHeh, there are boars running around there. Wait, what's that?! Bandits?! How'd they get here! Okay, what's over there? Oh! Wild boars... Two... Four... Six... How many are there?! Twelve! Damn, gotta get out of here!\n \n11:25\nOh well... I'm sitting in a tree... The boars ate all the bandits; they didn't notice me...\n \n15:43\nThese beasts are gone. Oh-ho-ho... I'm all stiff from sitting! Oh well...\n \n15:52\nWell, here's the farms... Ugh, okay, I'm going in...\n \n16:10\nAlright, they made a lair here! Oh! And a boar is lying here... Dead... Wait, where's my knife? Damn, it's hard to cut... What's that noise?! Goddammit! Wild boars! Aaah! TAKE THAT! AND THAT! YOU BASTARDS...</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_10_part_1"><text>From the diary of an unknown stalker.\n \n13.04.12 6:00\nWell... It's the Zone again... I've heard so much about it, but in reality, it's... it's... I can't even put all the feelings into words when you see it! Today I decided to pay a visit to Agroprom. They say a lot of artifacts appeared there after the Emission, and I bought a map of the underground of this research institute.\n \n8:50\nSurprisingly, I haven't run into anyone or anything (knock on wood!). I stopped at the Garbage, near the hangar. Inside, I found someone's corpse, probably a rookie—look, it's not a rifle but a double-barreled shotgun (in good condition, by the way, I should hide it, maybe I'll take it with me next time). There's no one in the vicinity, and that's good.\n \n11:00\nWell, I'm almost there. Man, there aren't that many artifacts. A couple of Stone Flowers and a Gravi. Now all my hope rests on the factory; otherwise, I took out a loan for ammo and the map (I hope a Controller gets Sidorovich! Although no one will get a monster like that, he'll twist him into a pretzel and make him buy something, ugh!)\n \n12:45\nI climbed onto the roof, just in time! A Bloodsucker was below! What a bastard, he was sitting in ambush, if I'd gone into the building, that'd be it—I'd be done for! It's a good thing I had a grenade with me... How lucky it was that it took him out! His whole snout is intact, so I can cut off his tentacles, at least that's some money.\n \n13:00\nThe scumbag! He has a cafeteria here, it turns out! I counted 4 corpses. I found Yurik (he had some kind of famous last name... oh! Semetsky!), he was a good guy... And we thought he went to Moscow, to his writer friend. Ugh, another good stalker is dead...\n \n14:00\nWell, here's the underground... Damn, I should have bought a night vision device after all! With a flashlight, I can't see anything.\n \n14:15\nIt's so quiet... it feels like someone regularly walks through here. (I heard there's some kind of faction's stash here! And also, that its leader went past the Brain Scorcher and came back!)\n \n14:30\nI found a Sea Urchin! Well, at least something worthwhile.\n \n14:35\nDamn it! Another Bloodsucker! Good thing I managed to shoot. Strange, he was looking at the vent, like he was waiting for something.\n \n14:40\nHa! And those rumors about the stash are true! There's a ladder and... damn, a tripwire!\n \n17:10\nIt hurts so bad! They set up a trap for all stalkers, so they wouldn't go there... And I, the fool, went for it, thinking there was nothing there! Man, it's a good thing it wasn't an F-1 grenade, or I wouldn't be lying here, but resting in Heaven... Though I'm in such a state that I won't be able to climb the ladder...\n \n17:50\nThat's it, this is the end, I crawled and fell into a Fruit Punch, my arms are all in this stuff...\n \n18:00\nI can't see anything... Oh, wait, I see a light! Yeah, a light...</text></string>

For official use only.\n \nExperiment 143\n \nSubject:\nWhite male, 33 years old.\nHeight - 180 cm.\nWeight - 100 kg.\n...was delivered to the research center under the personal supervision of Professor Seleznev...\n(...part of the document is water-damaged...)\n...an audio transcript is attached to the document:\n \nDay One\n17.00\nSubject is a male, 33 years old. Suffers from a severe form of Down syndrome. Understands human speech. Compliant.\nI injected the subject with serum L14-OC. We will observe the process.\n \n20.00\nAfter the initial diagnostics...\n(...part of the document is water-damaged...)\n \n21.30\n(...part of the document is missing...)\n...external signs: redness in the area of the elbow and knee joints, also the lymph nodes have enlarged... The subject complains of feeling unwell. We increased the serum dosage. Added some substances from the Berserk project (under my personal responsibility).\n \nDay Two\nPersonal notes:\nThe subject calmed down after yesterday. I was able to examine him; external signs of change have recently begun to appear. I hope this experiment will be a success. The subject's name is Vitalik. He came to us [information not subject to disclosure, redacted by censorship]. A very compliant subject, he considers me his daddy. Ha... We'll see how my boy sings next.\n \n10.32\nMmm... I think my idea about [information not subject to disclosure, redacted by censorship] from Berserk was a good idea. The subject is unusually active and barely sleeps. Today, we will conduct a series of initial physical tests.\n \n10.54\nAstonishing! Phenomenal. Vit... err... The subject has become much stronger. During the experiment, he lifted a barbell weighing 150 kg. Before the experiment, it was 80... (...part of the document is missing...) ...The subject moves quite nimbly on the wall bars, even upside down... (...a fairly large part of the document is missing...)\n \nDay 14\n10.00\nThe subject can't look at the hospital lamp's light. I need to consult with a knowledgeable specialist about this; I don't know yet what it is, his eyes, or maybe the nervous consequences of large doses of medication.\n \nFor now, I gave him a retired security guard's gas mask. The subject put it on his head and is running around the ward. It turned out to be quite... funny. Junior employee Ivenets said that's how they used to run around as "elephants" in the army.\n(Ask the supervisor to replace Ivenets, I don't need clowns in the lab.)\nThe subject has become even stronger. Bouts of unmotivated aggression have become more frequent. I think we should reduce the content in the serum (illegible). I'm afraid now even five orderlies won't be able to hold him.\n \n14.00\nAn examination revealed a significantly increased elasticity of the tendons. The subject can't have dislocations, despite often falling from a great height. I think there's enough material on his tendons for a dissertation. [Reviewer's remark: Sidortsov will have to be isolated upon completion of the experiment]\n \nThe supervisor ordered the gas mask to be taken from the Subject, the Subject snarled and shrieked, and the guards barely managed to handle him. (I think we should increase security; today, there aren't enough of them anymore.)\n \nDay 15\n10.30\nToday we will conduct jumping experiments all day... (...water-blurred...)\n \n18.00\nThe subject is capable of jumping a distance of almost 18 meters! This is... (...a large part of the document is missing...)\nPersonal notes:\nThe supervisor, Professor Schultz, is raging. Vitalik wasn't very "gifted" even before the experiment, and now he's become completely dull. Yes... Today, he pulled another stunt; he couldn't take a rifle apart. But we just explained it to him yesterday!</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_11_part_2"><text>He doesn't even talk. Just grunts or growls. The Subject didn't want to get out of the ward, so we lured him out with the gas mask. Had to give him his favorite toy back.\n12.10\nWe conducted the last examination of the Subject.\n400 heart muscle contractions per minute. His heart is pumping blood like a jet engine! Very elastic tendons. Bones are seriously oversaturated with calcium. The frontal bone has doubled in thickness.\nThe Subject doesn't feel pain, doesn't notice wounds... (...part of the document is chewed up and unreadable...)\n \nPersonal notes:\n... Schultz says the experiment is almost a failure, the Subject (I can't bring myself to call him Vitalik... no, that's not him anymore...) is completely uncontrollable. Yesterday, during his walk, he mauled an orderly and tried to escape. We barely caught him... (...the end of the document is missing...)</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_12_part_1"><text>Veteran's Notes\n \nJune 3, 2010\nSitting in the Bar. My partner, named Yakut, is with me. He's a good stalker, an experienced one. On the table: vodka, canned food, sausage, bread... yeah, the Barkeep’s rich with supplies... We're chowing down, tomorrow's a raid...\n \nJune 4\nWell, it's time to hit the road. The Duty base is right next to the Bar, so Sergeant Vasilyuk gave us a full ration: food, good guns—I have a Colt and an AK-108 with all the fixings: optics, an under-barrel grenade launcher, silencers, etc. Yakut took an M-16 and a Beretta, they gave him all the fixings too; they gave us ammo, new jumpsuits with night vision, flashlights, toilet paper... yes, yes, just in case a boar bucks next to you and you soil your pants )) It's happened before, more than one stalker came back with a wet spot in the middle.\n...We went to General Voronin's barracks, and he gave us a mission: get to the military warehouses, Freedom is based there, so we can crash with them if we need to (the general winced when he said it.. yeah, Duty and Freedom don't like each other), and then get to the Radar through the Barrier and go down into some basements to turn something off. They gave us some kind of headphones, said they'd help with the emissions... Well, let's go, with a prayer...\n \nJune 4, 4 hours later\nWell, this is fun... we're sitting in some little hut, still a good way to the warehouses... gotta get some sleep, the beasts are getting to us... We ran into a boar, a hefty one, probably four hundred kilograms... the bastard, knocked me off my feet, my wind got knocked out. Yakut crushed its skull with his M-16 while I was writhing under that behemoth... lucky escape... it's gonna get dark soon, gotta sleep...\n \nJune 5\nI slept poorly, some screams were coming from outside, like someone's guts were being pulled out while they were alive... brr, creepy... we've been walking for about two hours now, everything's quiet so far...\n \n...9 hours later\nWe got to the warehouses, the Freedomers turned out to be hospitable... we're sitting by the fire, the guys are telling tales, it's beautiful... but the path was terrible... we went through some little village, and five Bloodsuckers were sitting there, all in one hut, the bastards, were they playing checkers or something... we barely fought them off, we were jabbing at them with knives, they don't give a damn about bullets... my arm is ripped open, Yakut got hit in the gut... the bastards, so strong, they tore our jumpsuits to shreds... while we were licking our wounds, this guy came... what's he called... You know, the one on the tram... oh, Controller, yeah. He's walking, and our heads are spinning, everything's ringing, swimming... I don't remember how I took him out with my scope, I just remember my pistol flew out of its holster somewhere... I was blown away...</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_12_part_2"><text>June 7\nWe've been here long enough, it's time to say our goodbyes... the guys from "Freedom" patched us up, re-equipped us, gave us more ammo, food... good guys... they contacted the Barrier, told them to let us through... a cakewalk. The Barrier is an hour's walk away... well, time to hit the road...\n \n... 4 hours later\nThings went to shit at the Barrier—the beasts on the other side just started tearing through... damn, what didn't I see there—Snorks, zombies, boars, Bloodsuckers, a couple of Burer's (these freaks beat two guys to death with bricks, it was heartbreaking), and our guys were hosing them down with flamethrowers, the stench was horrible... In the end... (page torn out) ...it's goddamn awful. Yeah, that Radar is a terrifying place. There's a forest around it, the trees are crooked, as if there's a huge Whirligig in the center. There's such a sinister silence all around, holy crap, the slightest crunch and my heart's in my boots... we met some Monolith fighters, and you can't tell, they seem normal and yet not... ammo and food are slowly running out, and now my PDA just got a message—an Emission is coming soon... we've holed up in some bunker, waiting...\n \nJune 9\nThat damn Emission ruined all our plans. It was so radioactive outside that we spent two days stuck in a hole... (a piece of the page is missing)... a Monolithian shot me in the arm... a-a, it hurts so bad... Yakut is fine, but something's not right with him... he's become kinda restless, and I've got some voices in my head too... though, we're already near the entrance to the antennae territory, so the helmet must not be all-powerful... my rifle ammo is gone, I had to take an LR 300 from a zombie... a shitty rifle, the AK's better... what's THAT? A-a-ah, you scum, eat a grenade!...\n \nJune 10\nDamn, I feel so bad... so terrible... Yakut was killed... who was it? A healthy carcass (makes a boar look tiny), he was stomping like he weighed two tons. He literally smeared Yakut, a fountain of blood just sprayed out... I'm lying in the bushes... damn, all I have for ammo are two grenades and a pistol with two magazines... damn, I'm covered in blood... there's some chaos in my head, noise, voices... I can hear growling, and a Snork is crawling somewhere here... I feel like I'm done for...\n \nJune 11\nI can barely write... an Emission is coming soon, it shook once here, and I rolled out of the bushes... damn, I can't get up... will I really have to rot here... (torn out)... I'm trying to write faster, a zombie is coming towards me... I can hear its vile "Ki-i-ill"... I've got an idea... you're coming with me... I pull out a grenade with my last strength...\n \nDamn, the Emis...</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_13_part_1"><text>I was put on alert today, they said it was a landing operation. I was running out of the barracks and scraped my knee!!! How am I gonna jump now? Daaamn!!! I gotta go see Lopatych.\n \nWe're loaded up, flying... err... moving to the point. My knee hurts more and more, and then there's Bench, carry him every which way, he dropped his bag on my foot, you motherfucker, I'll kill the bastard!!!\n \nIt turns out we're landing at Agroprom, the stalkers there have a lot of suspicious activity... and we have a base nearby, so the Head of Guard got a little scared... and no wonder: he's got one and a half squads of first-year contractors, and about twenty seasoned stalker thugs are prowling nearby, who, if anything happens, will tear them to shreds like hamsters...\n \nWe're approaching the point. Down on the road, there are two stalkers, one saw us and took off! I swear to God, he beat the standard for Master of Sports!\n \nWe landed, shot at the stalkers... what beasts!!! There were only about ten of them there. I don't know where he got the 20 from, but the ten of them tore two paratrooper squads to shreds. Well, thank God we defeated them. Though one, the leader apparently, managed to escape into the complex.\n \nWe've surrounded the complex with the guys, deciding who's going in first. Vasily went to rummage through the stalkers' things, artifacts, and whatnot... (sound of a shotgun blast). OH SHIT!!! Vasily got rummaged, it seems, but a half-dead stalker is prowling around here somewhere!!! OH!!! I SEE HIM!!! (another shotgun blast, sounds of a short shootout). Oh shit... fuuuuuck... aaah... I... I'm wounded... by buckshot... in the... stomach... aaahhh... damn... it hurts so bad... all our guys are down... damn... the stalker... he's coming here... no, no!!! Don't!!! (sound of a pistol shot) noooo... nooooooo...</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_14_part_1"><text>Scientist's Log\n \nApril 12, 17:53\nSubject No. 283 died without regaining consciousness. Time since procedure - 2 hours 53 minutes. Cause of death - cerebral hemorrhage in the area of the left temporal lobe.\n \nApril 13, 10:31\nSubject No. 289. Procedure - irradiation with Kaimanov's emitter. Frequency - 3600 GHz. Wavelength - 0.305 nm.\nBefore the procedure, the subject was injected with 2 cc of preparation 3NKZP1.\n \nApril 13, 11:30\nThe first signs of irradiation are beginning to appear. The body is starting to be covered with lumpy growths, mostly in the area of the joints and the temporal and occipital parts of the head. The subject's mental state is passive; no reaction to external stimuli is observed.\n \nNote: it seems the radiation of this frequency and modulation was successful.\n \nApril 13, 12:41\nThe external signs of mutation are becoming more pronounced. A significant increase in the cranial brain case is noted. The skin is cracking and exuding foul-smelling secretions. The manifestation of telekinetic abilities is noted in the form of moving small objects - pens, pencils, etc.\n \nApril 13, 14:35\nThe subject is beginning to show signs of aggression. In an attempt to take measurements of the brain's electrical emissions, the subject tried to attack Junior Lab Assistant N.I. Kuznetsov. Security was able to hold him until the aforementioned lab assistant injected the subject with a sedative.\n \nApril 13, 16:34\nThe subject is becoming more and more aggressive. Using constantly progressing telekinetic abilities, he hurls various things at the staff, from pens to chairs.\n \nNote: I gave the order to remove all interior items in the room with the cameras.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_14_part_2"><text>April 13, 19:12\nThe subject's telekinetic abilities have developed so much that in an attempt to approach his cage, he pushed and severely hit assistant S.N. Aleksandrov against the wall.\n \nNote: the subject is becoming dangerous. I gave the order for the liquidation of subject No. 289.\n \nApril 13, 19:38\nThe liquidation attempt failed. The subject simply shot two guards with their own weapons. At the same time, he opened his cage using his abilities. The third surviving guard managed to lock him in block Z.\n \nI called for more guards to liquidate the subject...\n \nApril 14, 00:03\n...he killed everyone... now I'm locked in the food storage of block D. When contact with the lab is lost, 24 hours will pass before a search party is sent from the surface. I hope I can hold... [recording cut off]</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_15_part_1"><text>Day 341.\nToday we finally calibrated the emitter. That Kaimanov is an ignoramus! How could he release such an unrefined device! So much material was wasted! Oh well, the management promised a fresh batch soon. They promised political prisoners, that's good, they're much more suitable, their intelligence is higher...\n \nDay 345.\nMagnificent! Wonderful! Subject No. 74 has already undergone three sessions! The examination showed a significant increase in the temporal lobe. Looks like a Nobel Prize is in my future after all! Lena is coming the day after tomorrow. I'll show her my results. She'll definitely be happy!\n \nDay 346.\nThis is a momentous day. The Subject was able to control small animals. Not for long, though, and only in close proximity. We continue the irradiation.\n \nDay 347.\nI showed Lena my work. I demonstrated Subject No. 74. She said I'm a monster!!! That they're people!!! But she's a scientist! They're condemned prisoners, how can she not understand that they're just material!</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_15_part_2"><text>Day 349.\nAnother emergency. It seems the mutations are happening faster than expected; otherwise, we would have been ready. And that Yahontov, what an idiot! I told him not to get closer than three meters to the subject. Especially not during an experiment! As a result, the subject took control of him. I noticed something strange in his behavior and suddenly realized he was trying to order me not to notice it! Just to think, I never even dreamed of such a result! I had to give the order for the immediate liquidation of subject No. 74. What a pity! What prospects!\nWhen Lena saw the spectacle, she had a fit of hysterics. She cried, begging me to send her away from here, saying I'm a fascist, that it's all over between us. Over? It's just beginning! I ordered an orderly to give her a sedative and to put her under surveillance.\n \nDay 352.\nThree days have passed.\nLena doesn't want to see me. How can this be? What about our wedding in the fall? I can't live without her! Let her stay in the infirmary for now, and I'll think about how to make her change her mind.\n \nDay 361.\nI think I'm depressed. I can't do anything, my work is falling apart, yesterday subject No. 75 repeated the fate of his predecessor.\n \nLena maintains a proud silence, but through the glass, I can see her crying...\nWhat should I come up with?\n \nDay 363.\nI've got it! After processing her with the emitter, I'll be able to order Lena to change her mind. I need to be very careful so that the mutations don't become irreversible. This is the first time I've been scared in many years. But for her, I'm ready to do anything. I'll conduct the first session tonight. I also need to figure out how to do it without assistants...\n \nDay 366.\nMy subordinates are surprised by what I've been doing for three nights in a row, locked in the main hall. I had to come up with an excuse about "top-secret work."\n \nThe sensations are strange. For now, I'm using stabilization drugs to stop the external changes.\nLena is barely eating anything; she's become a shadow of herself. I need to hurry.\n \nDay 368.\nI can hear other people's thoughts. It's not just that: I can feel them. And I can direct them, it's weak so far, but a few more sessions...\n \nBy the way, everyone's suggestibility is different. Lena is the strongest. I can barely hear her. That's bad, I'll have to go all the way.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_15_part_3"><text>Day 370.\nI looked in the mirror. It's bad. For now, I'm ordering everyone not to notice how I've changed. I can already do this well. But Smirnov... It didn't turn out well. He had the highest threshold, after Lena, of course. I pushed too hard. And he became... I can't find the term, my brain is in a fog... I saw through his eyes, moved his hands... and when I let go—he died.\n \nDay 371.\nNormal food is disgusting. I'm eating raw meat. It's delicious.\nI'm controlling everyone in the lab. I had to take two of the guards on duty under full control. There's an inspection tomorrow, I can't let them see...\n \nDay 372.\nI took out the commission. There's nothing to check my achievements! When I'm back to normal, I'll tell them everything myself.\nIt's a shame that two people died, I still lack experience...\n \nTomorrow I'll go to Lena.\n \nDay 373.\nShe died.\n \nI walked in, and she screamed. I said it was me. She fell silent and huddled into a corner.\n \nI came closer, and she died from terror. What have I become?\nI held her hand and looked at her a long time. It hurt. Why? No one hit me.\nAnd how can anyone hit me now? I'm this... What... King?.. Tsar?... I remember the words, but what do they mean...\nOnly images... What is it? Master? That's it! Master! I know what that means.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_16_part_1"><text>The Diary of Dutyer Vladimir Dmitriyevich Letalo\n \nApril 27\nThey accepted me into Duty! I mean, no, not like that. It's like this, I’m in Duty! Now I have to prove that I'm not eating government rations for nothing. After all, no one really called me here. As they say, I came on my own. They gave me a real, brand-new Abakan with a scope and an under-barrel grenade launcher, and also a jumpsuit colored with our faction's colors. I couldn't stop admiring myself in the mirror in the Bar for a long time. Then there was drill, lunch, drill, dinner... The commander turned out to be serious. He even has a fearsome last name, Gromko, Dmitriy Petrovich Gromko. Man, he really put us through the wringer... by evening, I started to think I hated him. Oh well. He's not doing it out of malice. After all, I came here myself. Oh, whatever, the loudspeaker is blaring assembly... I'll write more when I get a chance.\n \nMay 1\nWe're on guard duty at the exit from the Wild Territory. I just snuck away for a minute, I'll jot something down. Pukh, Krivoi, and Sanya are squinting at me and teasing me. "Egghead," they say. They're all the same, look at them. I'll tell you about my friends. The four of us formed a kind of squad. A "quad", in Duty slang.\nPukh, he's a round, clumsy, weirdo who's trying to act like an intellectual. But he's got strength to spare; he could bend horseshoes. The commander solemnly handed him a government-issued RPK and four ammo belts. Now he's impersonating Rambo. He's wrapped himself in ammo belts, has the machine gun on his shoulder, and is menacingly staring into the distance, with his round glasses on his nose.\nKrivoi, he's even worse. A tall, skinny alcoholic with constantly red eyes, a gloomy look, and a persistent allergy. He's always sneezing, scratching himself, and talks through his nose, which makes him sound like the translator Volodarskiy. He's our sniper. Gromko (Dmitriy Petrovich) said he shoots a little too well, and no less solemnly than Pukh, so he handed him a battered SVD.\nWell, and Sanya, that's a separate story. Sanya isn't a name, but a nickname just like all of ours. From the looks of him, he's a completely unremarkable stalker. Age—30-35 years old. But. He's more experienced than all of us combined. So Gromko, without thinking twice, appointed him our commander and gave him an L85 with a silencer and an under-barrel grenade launcher. Sanya also has a jumpsuit different from ours—he has a helmet with a visor made of tinted glass that completely hides his face. It's a co-o-ol thing. At least it looks menacing.\nNow we're like an inseparable team. All right, my guys are yelling at me; they must have seen something. I'll go take a look.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_16_part_2"><text>May 2\nMotherfucker, I don't know how I'm still alive. Some horrifying thing came at us from the Wild Territory yesterday. Some creature broke down the gate and rushed at us—a large mutant, like a boar, but with two heads and much faster and stronger. Pukh immediately opened fire with his machine gun, managed to knock the creature down, and Sanya finished the beast off with his pistol (a Desert Eagle, by the way, a terrifying thing). He said that the mutant is called a Chimera... brr... We thought it was all over. But no. Fifteen minutes later, such a pack of blind dogs, mixed with Pseudodogs, charged at us through the breach, a pack like I'd never seen in my life—about sixty of them. Pukh's machine gun came in very handy again; he didn't even have to aim. Krivoi was skillfully throwing grenades—the enemies just flew into pieces. Sanya was shooting mostly at the Pseudodogs. Well, and I was just firing into the crowd of mutants. I've never seen so much blood and so many corpses in my life. It's a good thing three more quads came to help a couple of minutes later. We fought off that wave. Phew... The whole diary is covered in mutant blood now. Got splattered, you know.\n \nMay 6\nYeah, it's been a while since I've picked up my cherished notebook. But suddenly, luck struck—the Colonel was recruiting quads for a raid on Yantar to clear out the zombies. The Ecologists sent a message that, you know, the zombies have multiplied so much you can't throw a brick without hitting one. So we agreed. I'm sick of drills and guard duty, we gotta get things done! We'll cleanse the Zone of mutants! Ugh!\n \nMay 7\nWe packed our things—and hit the road. The Wild Territory again. I don't wanna trudge there, but what can you do—we have to. We approached the passage from the Duty territory. On the wall, there's a huge banner that says, “Don't go there… they'll tear ya apart." Into little pieces. But, as they say, we have to.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_16_part_3"><text>May 8\n \nWe made it. It was a complete shitshow... Not counting the Bloodsucker and the bandits. The mercenaries, "mercs," as Sanya calls them, and the dogs were especially making life hell. Both of them attacked several times, but we managed to fight them off somehow and even endured an ambush in an abandoned house. But the Geiger counter was rattling nonstop there, and we had to retreat outside quickly. While Sanya was talking to Sakharov, we climbed onto the bunker to have a look around. A spooky, oppressive place. Krivoi took out his firearm, lay down on the roof, and began to shoot the zombies methodically. Mostly the unarmed ones. He's a sly bastard, heh. Half an hour later, Sanya came out and said that if we shoot the zombies on the shore and around the bunker, we'll get five grand a head. If we get to X-16 and shoot them there, the price increases threefold per head. The scientists themselves will leave the bunker for two weeks, leaving only one guard on duty. He'll give us the money.\n \nMay 9\nWe've shot more than a hundred of them, probably. And they just don't stop. Scum. I hate them. Pukh was bitten by a Snork yesterday. He was shot in time, but the Snork still bit Pukh's wrist. \nNight. I can't sleep. Pukh, the poor guy, is groaning terribly. His wrist is swollen and festering. The scientist threw up his hands, saying, “You know, there's nothing we can do.” The prick. We're staying, by the way, in one of the barracks behind the bunker. There are two of them here, but one is enough for us. Though I don't think so anymore. I wish this whining idiot would be moved away from us!\nGod, what is this nonsense... it must be because of overwork. Oh well, I'll try to fall asleep.\n \nMay 10\nMy head hurts terribly. It feels like a lead ball is rolling around inside. Damn... Interestingly, all our guys feel the same... The pressure must have dropped. It happens. Today, when we were leaving the barracks, Krivoi caught the doorframe with his rifle butt and accidentally pulled the trigger. The bullet flew a centimeter from my head. I hate him. I'll remember this, even though he apologized a lot. I know he did it on purpose... He wanted to kill me!\n \nDamn, what is this nonsense? Ugh. Today, killing zombies was an incomparable pleasure; I was able to vent my anger on someone. One of them said so pitifully, "mamma-a-a..." when a bullet took half his head off.\n \nI shot and laughed. I've probably never laughed like that before... I barely managed to calm down.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_16_part_4"><text>May 11\nKrivoi and Sanya got into a fight today, Pukh barely broke them up. His wrist is already blue, and he can't move his fingers. We washed the wound with vodka and bandaged it. Gave him some painkillers. He seemed to feel better.\nThe situation is tense. Krivoi, Sanya, and Pukh are mostly silent. They're clearly up to something.\n \nWe shot some zombies and Snorks, and almost made it to X-16. We returned to the barracks and went to sleep.\n \nMay 12\nThey're plotting something against me... I saw how they looked at me... I hate them... I didn't do anything to them....\n \nMay 13\nI did it last night. I walked into the barracks when they were sitting and playing cards. They even smiled and greeted me. Two-faced bastards! Why are they like that?!\n \nThey still thought I was joking when I raised the rifle.... And I laughed and pulled the trigger. They were screaming and begging me not to kill them... They said they didn't understand anything... Said I'd gone crazy... ME?! I've gone crazy?! Ha-ha! Nonsense!\n \nI shot until the magazine was empty...\n \nAnd then... I don't remember... I remember pounding on the bunker door and asking to be let in, screaming that I'd destroyed the enemies... that it wasn't my fault that my "comrades" turned out to be them...\n \nMay 14\nI'm sitting near the bunker. Zombies are walking around... I... I suddenly realized what I'd done. I killed my friends. The ones who shared shelter and food with me, who covered my back...\n \nI sobbed and howled so much that even the zombies were afraid to approach me... I'm a monster... I hate myself...\n \nThis is the last entry... It's hard for me to write... my hands are shaking... I can't see well, tears are blurring my vision... I can feel something pressing on my brain... Where... is my Beretta?.. It should end this... this... tor... ture...</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_17_part_1"><text>Day 1.\nGod, how did I get myself into this? In the middle of Agroprom, which I've crossed far and wide, I run into a Controller! I've been treading the Zone for years. Or have I? No! As long as I'm still alive, I have to fight... It's a good thing that, for some reason, I can talk. The voice recorder is set to activate by the sound of my voice, and the batteries will last for a long time. Maybe my recordings will help someone, at least...\n \nOkay, in order. My name is Andreyev Vitaliy Sergeyevich. I'm in my fourth year in the Zone, a lone veteran. I used to be in Freedom, but that was a long time ago. Today... I don't remember the date! I... I don't remember any dates at all! Not even my birthday! Okay, let's say today is day one. In the morning at Agroprom, I wanted to wait out an Emission in a destroyed railway tunnel. Because of the large number of anomalies, the detector didn't pick up the Controller hiding there. I didn't even have time to raise my rifle... It's believed that a person who falls under the influence of a Controller is incapable of thinking and is a typical zombie. At least, people who survived after the death of the creature controlling them don't remember anything... He fully controls my body, but my mind is still intact. I can talk and even move my head a little. In His... Pack? Squad? Group? Okay, let's say group. In His group, besides me, there are three more zombies of varying degrees of preservation, a couple of swamp Fleshes, and 6-8 dogs. I can't say for sure about the dogs, they're constantly running, and it's hard for me to turn my head to count them... It's also hard for me to talk, so that's enough for today.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_17_part_2"><text>Day 2.\nI'm terribly hungry. And thirsty. I never thought a zombie could experience such desires! I wonder if He feeds His servants? Or when they die, does He recruit new ones? The dogs, I saw them eating a Fleshette. We finally moved from our spot. We're heading to the Swamps.\n \nI took part in His... Or our? Hunt. The dogs cut a couple of fatter monsters from the pack of Fleshes, and I shot them. Or did He shoot them? But how? He doesn't have a weapon... Through me? A Controller shot two Fleshes through me... Sounds funny, don't you think?\n \nI don't find it funny at all!!! You should be in my place!!! God, what's wrong with me? A minute ago, I was ready to tear everyone apart with my bare hands... It seems His influence is taking its toll after all... Where am I going? What??? Noooo!!! I'm not gonna eat this!!! Radioactive raw meat!!! Noooo... (Incomprehensible gurgling, turning into slurping).\n \nThen we drank water from the radioactive swamp. Now I'm definitely a living corpse. But at least I can talk passably.\n \nDay 3.\nToday we ran into a military man.\nAnd He's not a bad tactician. He threw the dogs and zombies forward, while the military guy was taking them down. I moved closer and put him down.\n \nI had to eat human flesh. I don't like military guys, but not that much... I can still make jokes, imagine that... It's just that the humor is very dark... I haven't slept for three days now, and I don't want to! At least there are some advantages to my situation. Only my head is starting to hurt.\n \nDay 4.\nI get it now why He bothers with Fleshes in the group. They're useless! But today there was no prey all day, and we ate one. An interesting emergency food supply system. In the evening, we did get two Fleshes, and He took both. But a strange discord started in the group, and we ate one more. The discord stopped immediately. It seems He can't control too many creatures. By the way, He's sleeping. Not for long, but during this time, His control weakens a little. This creature has a tight grip on me, but one dog managed to escape yesterday.</text></string>
<string id="kontroler_diary_17_part_3"><text>Day 5.\nIt seems to be getting colder. I say "seems" because I can't feel the temperature at all. But in the morning, there was frost on the grass. I started to FEEL the group. If I concentrate, I can even look through the eyes of one of them. God, what's happening to me? Today, another person was killed. A regular stalker, and I didn't feel ANYTHING at all. I didn't care.\n \nI realized that while He's sleeping, I can control someone from the group. It's very weak for now; it's easy with the dogs, harder with the zombies. It seems they don't have any of their own nervous activity left, so I have to control their every movement. What a bummer! I can control others, but not myself...\n \nDay 6.\nHe seems to sense something. Today, he came up to me and looked me in the eyes for a long time. I pretended to be a stump. I have to do something. It's night now. He fell asleep. I know what to do.\n \nCome on, dear, come hereee... one more step. That's right, now take the rifle from me... You fool, I said, take it, not drop it... There... Got it... The bolt is cocked, good... Now slowly, slowly... It's only five meters. And don't drop it, you jerk! You!!! Excellent! Now raise the barrel... Higher... Yes, right to the temple... And slooowly pull the trigger... (Sound of a gunshot). Huuuurrrrraaahhhh... Hey, where are you going? Get back here! Look at them, running off... Yessss I ammm... I want to eaaat... I saw a sssstaaalker by the swamp in the evening... Sssweeeet meaaaat...\n \n(Followed by incomprehensible gurgling and growling, the recording cuts off.)</text></string>

Thursday\n
...Today they said we're starting the global experiment on Monday. It's weird, why'd they decide to check everything at once? We were supposed to do it in phases over a week... And there's not enough material; half of them died last time. But the bosses know best. Probably someone from above pressured them; no wonder the big shots showed up. Oh well. My job's a small one—they'll put me at some device to take readings. The theorists will make the conclusions without us. \n
Word got around that Department B got an unexpected result from their research. They found out that if you put four different types of artifacts: a Jellyfish, a Droplet, a Stone Blood, and a Thorn into a Fruit Punch anomaly, the resulting transmutation generates a brand new artifact with amazing qualities! This modificate, which was given the working name "Symbion," blocks 50% of psi-emissions! \n
I find that hard to believe. In general, the appearance of some organisms in the central lab from time to time can't be predicted. It's all dangerous...\n\n
Friday\n
...Turns out they're putting me at the central console with some rookie, also a graduate student. Burnov, you see, is sick, Yastrebov hasn't recovered from the attack yet, Glebova isn't allowed, and others are also covering holes somewhere because of a lack of people. And when will the real reinforcements arrive? This is the only new guy that showed up all month, and he hasn't even properly studied the equipment yet... Well, whatever. I've worked there before, I can handle it alone if I have to... \n
...At the Friday briefing, they said security measures would be increased. Look what they did last time... Security will be beefed up, entry is by code only, everyone needs to wear protective suits. (That's why I see the military crawling around everywhere.)\n
...They trained us to work in the suits, as if they thought we'd forgotten how to put them on. These suits are so inconvenient; whoever came up with the idea that we have to work in them? We'll be in a confined space anyway... By the way, they put a code lock on the door to the control room after the recent events. And all the codes will be updated on Monday; we'll only find out right before launch. \n \n
Saturday \n
...They gave us a day off. And tomorrow is prep... \n
I talked to our scientific minds... I don't like any of this. It's so pessimistic. Why do they think there's a chance that a dangerous psi-surge is possible? Or are they just playing it safe? There's no concrete evidence; there's only this professor's theory, who just arrived. He, you see, calculated everything in his quiet office, and we couldn't see it in practice here... And they talked about some kind of portal. But they went quiet when I came over. I tried to find out from them, but no, they're following the protocol and not really sharing their findings with us graduate students.\n
...But among ourselves, we relaxed a little, since it's a day off, and we decided that this is just a test before a big commission, a major drill for "unforeseen situations," so they can write everything down after the fact, saying, you know, drills were regularly conducted, but the last situation was truly unforeseen, but now we're going to "strengthen and reinforce even more, bring it to everyone's attention, with signatures..." It's the same as everywhere else, as usual, first a situation, then drills for if they happen... We should've trained earlier, and there wouldn't have been these losses among the staff and spoiled material. \n \n
Sunday \n
...I found out that the exits from the supposedly dangerous zones will be blocked by a code for the duration of the experiment. The code is elementary; you have to pass a simple IQ test. What's that for? Haven't I already passed enough tests when I got here? This new professor has been telling them stories about "possibly-probable" psi-emissions... Right. I took a quick look at this "test", it's some kind of kindergarten stuff, everything is already clear, could one of us really be so stuck that we couldn't solve these simple problems in 2 minutes?.. Even that new student will be able to. \n
...So, they've decided to play for real, to practice for unforeseen situations, so to speak... Or is this a test of psychological stability and compatibility? They're secretly experimenting on us, too. Why would they send a graduate student (even a smart one like me) to the central console? And they foisted this rookie on me. I said right away that I didn't want to work with him, so they shoved him in. Armchair psychologists... Oh well, after the experiments we'll laugh at this joke together. \n \n
Monday \n
...Alright. We've arrived. I'm already tired from showing my pass to every guard I come across. Where did they get so many of them? And no one gave me the code for the room; the guard just let me in. Conspirators! Okay, where's this test? ah, well, it's all clear, I'll be able to get out without a guard... \n \n
...Started. Everything's normal... except that this clumsy rookie almost broke the vernier from his eagerness. I took him off it for now, took everything on myself, he'd better just watch and not touch anything for now... \n \n
...Everything as usual, nothing new... \n \n
...Aha! That's what it is! The professor ordered to change the intensity and modulation. So that's what his "theory" is all about. Well, let them submit it, I'll connect it, my job is a small one. They're the theorists and we're the practitioners, our job is to record the readings, as long as they don't go beyond the measurement limits of the devices, they already burned one device once... \n \n
...Whoa! There was a solid shake and some kind of hum... What the hell! The lights are flickering. They've really overdone it with their emergency-unforeseen drills... And what's that?! These readings can't be right!!! \n \n
...The connection is gone. The lights are flickering... I can hear some kind of howling... \n \n
...I finally came to a bit... There was some kind of flash, I was almost blinded, and a rumble... That source of light has become significantly smaller, but it's hanging there like a light bulb; it's blinding, I can't really see anything because of it... What's happening in there? Who's running around?! Something's pounding horribly at the door!!! And my head... my head! And him... what's wrong with him?! What happened to him? \n \n
...Oh my God, they're shooting! Our guard is shooting at someone... My head is splitting! ... And he's still shooting... without stopping... And something's trying to break down the door... I need to get out, but not now... when he stops shooting... Ow, my head... And I really don't like this graduate student—he's huddled under the table and watching... with a terrifying look... \n \n
...He's gone quiet... out of ammo or what?.. And this student... he's really gone crazy... Get out, fast, while he's under the table... my head hurts so bad... I can't anymore... if I don't get out in five minutes, I'll stay here... the code... why are these tests so difficult, who came up with such difficult problems?! Or?! Could they have... foreseen... this?! \n \n
...I can't, my head... it hurts... I killed him, the student... He was... like a zombie... worse... I can't remember the code... It's hard to solve... I need to brute force it... I can't... \n \n
...Mom, dad... I want aappple... I want... to pee...</text>

<string id="prade_1_1_text"><text>
Yes, wondrous are Your works, O Lord! My granny, bless her heart, was uneducated, but how right she was! My grandpa would grumble and complain, cursing her for secretly praying and going to church. He'd give her lectures, but my grandmother believed... And now here I am in the Zone, looking at miracles, and I understand: there is a higher power, there is! And we, the unfortunate and destitute, can't comprehend it. We just have to believe!\n\n
...\n\n
I met an interesting man; they call him Father Diodor. He isn't a holy man, but he's seen a lot and judges everything with a sound mind, even if it's in his own way. It's a shame he had urgent business; I would have stayed with him longer. It felt so peaceful around him in this troubled place. He isn't greedy and doesn't chase after loot like most of the others who operate here. And that week I spent with him wasn't wasted. I've understood a lot...\n\n
...
</text></string>

<string id="prade_1_2_text"><text>
...A miracle happened to me today. I went for a Fireball in a hollow; I saw it from afar, but out of greed, and apparently the stupidity inherent in all of humanity, I forgot to look around. A pack of dogs jumped me. But it seems the saints and the memory of my beloved grandma, Lukerya, are watching over me... I jumped back, and right there was a spawn of the devil, the "Springboard"! It threw me to the side, and the whole pack fell right into it! This must be a sign for me… He needs me for something. When I get home, I'll go to church, light candles for the saints, and remember my grandma. And I should remember my grandpa, too. Even though he didn't believe in God and, when he was young, even helped remove crosses from churches, for which he was once stabbed with a pitchfork at night, he lived honestly! He didn't steal or covet what belonged to others...\n\n
...\n\n
For so many nights now, I've been having strange dreams, as if someone is calling me. And today, I finally heard that call while I was awake! Whose are you? God's or the devil's?..\n\n
...\n\n
God exists! He truly does! I thought the demons were tempting me again; a voice sounded in my head! But no—the voice didn't tempt me; instead, it revealed truths that were hidden before. It was about how the world is mired in debauchery and greed, and that there is no love for one's neighbor in people! And it explained to me that even though God is one, He has many essences. And for the salvation of humanity, one of these essences is very close, but the path to it is difficult because it is a path of knowledge and humility. But this path leads to happiness. And I have been chosen by it. I'm coming to you; I hear you!...\n\n
...
</text></string>
<string id="prade_1_3_text"><text>
...Bodily weakness will not stop me on the path to Him, and I will travel the entire long road, but I will be happy by His side. And the proof of His essence, a divine gift that He gives to His chosen children. And now I, too, can communicate with Him and His helpers without opening my mouth by the power of thought!..\n
...\n\n
It's already hard to speak, but I'm still able to write, for I must express and convey His Word... My body grows weaker, but my spirit only grows stronger thanks to Him...\n\n
...\n\n
...Weakness has completely overcome me, but I finally see His faithful servants. They are coming; they will help me. I was told that these servants are His protectors, as not everyone believes in His power, and human greed is capable of many things. But they are also the guides to Him. And their angelic weapon punishes the unfaithful with His flesh, and there is no weapon more terrifying for the unfaithful. But for those who have surrendered to Him, their weapon brings happiness. For a shard of His flesh drives the darkness from the soul, bringing the light of Consciousness. Yes, it is truly so; He sacrifices His blood and flesh for our good! He is great, and even a tiny shard of His flesh is capable of working miracles! So allow me to merge with the single Consciousness, help me...</text></string>


<string id="prade_2_name"><text>Notes of One Walking to a Goal</text></string>
<string id="prade_2_desc"><text>Part 1</text></string>
<string id="prade_2_1_text"><text>The Zone is a strange place. Not because of its manifestations or horrors, but because of its people. Everyone is here. The same street thugs I knew since childhood, and laborers from districts where people waited for new housing for years and died without getting it, and self-taught philosophers... And so I've blended in with this motley crowd. It just so happened that I had to flee to the Zone, flee from serious problems, from a life that had gone completely wrong. I wanted to wait it out. And now I'm "enjoying" the local "aroma." I made good money from my first forays and timid returns to the "mainland," and Sidor helped me get my documents. Now I'm just a dropout student. Hmm, my diploma work at the faculty was admired. But it's my own fault; I should have kept things simpler.\n\n
...\n\n
It's strange how the Zone pulls you in. You return to the "mainland," and you seem to have everything: money, opportunities, clean, unsullied sheets... But you're drawn back to the smelly, dangerous Zone. What pulls you, what force? Adrenaline? Not the thrill of a race on a highway after a bet with friends, not a parachute jump, but the adrenaline of a game with an old woman who never makes mistakes, with Death herself... Maybe. But there's something more...</text></string>

<string id="prade_2_2_text"><text>Here it is, the goal, I get it now! I don't believe in fate or divine providence; I was born a materialist and will die one. But the goal... Everyone seeks wealth, affirms themselves by leading groups of more primitive people, but right here, there's a riddle. And it's a riddle for which they're willing to give everything for an answer—fame, money, a lost name. Whatever you want, the world's best prizes, recognition! The Monolith. No matter what anyone says or calls this entity, one thing is clear: it exists. And this is my chance...\n\n
...\n\n
It's all simpler than I thought. There are always those who want something, and a group was put together quickly. Professionalism, vanity, greed, thirst for power, self-abuse, what a beautiful tangle! They're not a burden to me; I just need to see them as a tool to achieve my goal, that's all.\n\n
...\n\n
And here's the Radar... So much food, ammo, and first-aid kits had to be brought in. The guys patrolled the edge of the field for so many days, and after a week of observation, a stable "window" finally appeared. That's it—we can't wait; we're moving out tomorrow.\n\n
In Pripyat. A strange weakness. Not radiation. Something else is here. It seems passing through the radiation field isn't without consequence... But that's not what's important. What's important is the Call; I think someone called it "mental contact." I've never encountered anything like this. But it's too late to turn back.</text></string>

<string id="prade_2_3_text"><text>He's close, so close. I never thought I'd start believing in Something. What it tells me and what it allows me to touch is both horrible and beautiful. I can hear the thoughts of others from any distance. I can create food out of thin air. But my body, my body is weakening noticeably. I have to hold on to it; all my "partners" no longer control theirs...\n\n
He explained everything, bodily life is transient. But I still have to hold on. I need a "beacon"... let it be Zhenka, it's strange I haven't thought of him for a long time. A childhood friend, attics, basements... then Zhenka got heavily into drugs. We met again after some time. He could barely control his body, but he would just smile at all my pleas and say: “You can't understand how wonderful it is!” That's the feeling, that disgust for the half-dead smiling body, that I have to hold on to. It's my trump card in my communication with Him.\n\n
...\n\n
Now I am close to everything; I am everywhere! Distances and instant travel are under my control. But I still cling to my body; I even patched it up; He taught me how... Zhenka, something familiar... oh, that weak boy who hanged himself after coming back from the military enlistment office. A weakling... just like everyone afraid to come... useless biological mass. But He's right; they deserve pity...\n\n
...\n\n
He said that now I can control time! He offered to move me to the past, to the moment when I can decide everything again and choose a goal. And everything will be normal; there will be a name, a job, fame... everything! But why? What's the point of all that? I'm already happy; I'm with Him, and He can give me Everything! I have reached the goal...</text></string>

<string id="prade_3_name"><text>Notes of a Seeker</text></string>
<string id="prade_3_desc"><text>Part 1</text></string>
<string id="prade_3_1_text"><text>It's alright here in the Zone. Everything is pretty clear, without any unnecessary fuss. It kinda reminds me of the orphanage on Lyakhovskaya street, though that place makes me wanna spit just thinking about it. Now, if only I could find Seryoga. He went and got involved with that bitch Lariska. I told him: What the hell do you need her for? But no, he was stubborn, said he loved her! What's to love? No ass, no character, just insatiable greed: want, want, want! And so the idiot went into the Zone! But there's no one closer than Seryoga. We've been through so much together! I remember when he first got to our snake pit... A lil' wolf cub! Wild eyes, growling and crying... Why did he come up to me? He doesn't even know, but since then, we've been together. And now this cobra... Ah, hell!\n\n
...\n\n
The Zone doesn't seem that big, and there aren't that many people, but it's not easy to find the person you need. I've been hanging around here for a month already; the trail ends around Yantar.\n\n
...\n\n
I got a tip from one of the guys about the Freedom base; it wouldn't hurt to check it out. But I doubt Seryoga would take a liking to some other gang after the orphanage; he always kept his distance from the crowd... But the tip isn't empty; he was here! But it turns out he went to the Radar! What the hell? It's supposed to be impassable, isn't it? Maybe I should just give up the search...</text></string>

<string id="prade_3_2_text"><text>No, I'm already alone in life; I won't abandon Seryoga! He wouldn't abandon me, he definitely wouldn't! It's bad enough that I don't even have a single photograph of my parents, and I don't know what they looked like, and now I'm supposed to lose Seryoga too!?\n
...\n\n
So this is what you look like, Radar! A strange place, scary, but somehow it calls to you. It's a good thing I picked the right artifacts for the trip; it's a strain on my mind, and I feel weak, but I can manage to walk. Most importantly, I found the letter S on a tree, in the shape of a lightning bolt! Seryoga used to mark the way with his penknife in the forest where we hid for a week after a fight at the orphanage, from our hut to the spring and the station, so we wouldn't get lost!\n
...\n\n
I talked to Seryoga in a dream today... Was I hallucinating? But it was so strange... He told me not to be afraid and to keep going forward. And he said that if it gets tough, there's a stash under a tree, marked with a sign; there's food and medicine there... Is this a hallucination? Either I'm losing my mind or this is a waking dream, but I found the stash that Seryoga talked about in my dream. What is happening?..\n</text></string>


<string id="prade_3_3_text"><text>
If I am losing my mind, this kind of madness doesn't scare me at all. Because now I can talk to Seryoga more often. He's also happy that I'm close and we'll be together soon! And he also said that if I want to, I can now speak to Him, and He will answer any question I have. I said that I've already solved my most important question, where my friend is! And Seryoga said: "He knows what you're grieving about. He knows that you would like to see your parents just once, and He knows that they loved you madly and grieve with you, knowing about the accident in which they died when you weren't even a year old"! I don't know what to think...\n
...\n\n
Today I finally spoke with Him. He is truly omnipotent! I saw the past! I remembered! I saw the face of the midwife who told my mother (yes, I remembered HER face and voice!): "It's a boy!" I saw my dad, who picked me up and whom I peed on, and dad laughed and said: "Wow! He's already invited me to his wedding"! I even remembered the rattles on the stroller—they were maroon. I'm crying for the first time in many years... I have very little strength left, but I will make it. I will get to Seryoga and to Him and remember EVERYTHING. Only the good things, and all the bad things that happened before will become just a dream...</text></string>

<string id="prade_4_name"><text>Notes of the Chosen One</text></string>
<string id="prade_4_desc"><text>Part 1</text></string>

<string id="prade_4_1_text"><text>Freaks! Nothing but freaks everywhere! What a dump to be born in! You watch the rich kids living the high life while you're slaving away! But don't worry, we'll get our turn! I'll make some serious cash here and live the life that the lucky ones deserve!\n\n
...\n\n
Sidor, that greedy bastard, is always trying to snatch a bigger piece. What a freak! That major, that drunken jerk, with his arrogant soldiers. He's got nothing to eat himself, and he still gives stuff to them! Good thing I took a detour and got lucky, it seems! I found a corpse, and he had decent gear and some good stuff on him. And a PDA with a stash in the Army Warehouses. Alright, I gotta head there and get away from this corpse. Someone else might want the inheritance! Screw them! I've been slaving my whole life as it is!\n\n
...\n\n
This is crap; you don't really get rich in this Zone! Not many artifacts, and everything's being sold for triple the price, the bastards! You gotta pay for everything! Nobody gives anything for free! I fixed the generator for that idiot at the Bar; I've got golden hands, but that scumbag just handed me a couple cans of food and a bottle of fake vodka and told me to get lost! I went to charge a battery, and he already didn't remember me and was shaking me down for money! What a bastard! Just like Semyonych, for whom I worked on a "Niva" at the vocational school. He promised me gold mountains and a job where the French paid real money. And after I did everything, he turned his face away, pretending he didn't remember!...</text></string>
<string id="prade_4_2_text"><text>All my supplies are running out; what do I do? I have no idea! I gotta find some stuff, this cursed Zone!...\n\n
...\n\n
What a disgrace! Who knew they were watching me? Things were going so well! I tracked down a stalker who hid his loot by the helicopter, right next to the Freedom base, and I got into his stash. The guy, to be fair, was a pro and wired a couple of 'foos' in there, but my hands are golden! And then that scumbag showed up and started shaking his Remington in my face. What a spoiled rich kid!\n\n
...\n\n
I thought nobody would notice me slit his throat. But that freak didn't come alone, so I had to make a run for it, and of all places—to the Radar!\n\n
...\n\n
Well, what do you know, it doesn't seem that scary here. But I don't get it. Who's talking to me? I'm not an idiot or crazy. I don't know who he is, though. But it seems like he's the one who knows everything. He explained everything perfectly, as if he knew everything about me or read my mind. He told me that I'm the one who deserves the best, and about my golden hands, and about the stupid women who turned their faces away, and he suggested a good route to take, and pointed out where the expensive capsules are. And he also advised me to go forward and not look back—the loot ahead will be better!\n\n
...\n\n
Now everything has fallen into place! Now I understand everything. Everything that happened before this was a test! All that madness I lived through—it was just a path to Him! And now He knows how to reward me because I am the one who deserves to get Everything that's coming to me. And all this happiness is free! Because I am the Chosen One!\n\n
