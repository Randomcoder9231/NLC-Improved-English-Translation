<string id="tex_info_letter_for_borov"><text>Buddy, I'm going underground for some time. My deputy, Ivantsov, has been constantly watching me lately. I think until he's eliminated we need to shut down our affairs. Our client remained very pleased with the last delivery and reports that fifty thousand dollars has been credited to your account. Since dollars aren't valued in the Zone, here's some local money and a small present to relax</text></string>
<string id="mixture_reward_text"><text>Drank some of that concoction, they say... Haven't been this messed up in a long time. But as my head cleared, one memory surfaced so vividly and in such detail, as if it happened yesterday, though I'd swear on anything - it was long ago, definitely before Redhead found me by the truck...\nI was looking once for a place to spend the night. Wandered onto a farmstead, there was a cellar - seemed dry, didn't stink of anything, not even rats. Started looking around and discovered in the corner, behind an old rotten crate, a torn tactical vest covered with long-dried blood, worn combat boots, some other rags, and a worn officer's map case. Looked like someone had looted a soldier and thrown away what wasn't useful. Nothing valuable, of course, but inside the map case I found a photograph with writing on the back: "you'll pick up the last order in a week here". Looks like the vicinity of that checkpoint on Cordon. I remember thinking that apparently the smugglers had someone from the military on payroll there... was. There's probably a stash by that water tower. Maybe something valuable is still lying there, since the owner of the map case is apparently long dead. Should get there quietly and check... if, of course, I haven't already been there and conveniently forgotten about it.</text></string>

<!-- диалоги Сидора -->
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_101"><text>Hey there... How you doing, lucky one? I see you're standing on your feet already. I wasn't hoping for it, thought we'd have another cross on our cemetery, with the inscription "Unknown stalker"!</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_102"><text>Good health to you too. Sometimes it gets dark in my eyes, but otherwise seems normal.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_103"><text>Yeah... Doc worked another miracle.\nYour face, between you and me, your own mother wouldn't recognize! Well, never mind, we're not in a beauty salon.\nWhen you see Redhead - thank him! If not for him, you'd have been a good dinner for the local dogs.\nWhat's your name?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_104"><text>Mine? Don't know... Don't remember a damn thing... Who am I and where is this?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_105"><text>Don't remember? Strange... Then you'll be Marked by the Zone, or simply Marked One for now. The Zone sure left its marks on you... Can't count them all!\nCall me Sidorovich, I trade here, help stalkers.\nI spent money on you, Marked One! So honestly speaking, you'd need to work it off. Got any strength left?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_106"><text>Yeah, I don't mind, I can dig a garden, bring water.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_107"><text>Joking? Means you're on the mend.\nYou're still too weak to dig gardens!\nThis is the ZONE, bro. Our Cordon is the Zone's anteroom, you could say. Not too dangerous, but don't get cocky. Anomalies, mutants, artifacts, monolith - do such words mean anything to you?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_108"><text>I think I remember... Artifacts? Money for them?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_109"><text>Exactly! You got to the essence! Anyway, you'll have a simple task for now.\nWhen you exit the bunker, turn left and climb up the hill. Kolyan Dove told me he saw some glint there in the fog. Maybe an artifact. Dove himself didn't go - got scared, it radiates a bit there... Bring it - then we'll think if we can do business with you.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_110"><text>I don't have anything, what should I do if something happens?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_111"><text>What could happen there? You have bolts. I'll give you a knife... a very good one.\nYes! Do you at least remember that artifacts can shock you?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_112"><text>How's that? Made of glass or what?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_113"><text>Yeah, made of glass... Your eyes will be glass when you take an artifact without protective means.\nYeah... Glass... You made the old man laugh.\nAnyway, let me remind you: an artifact is a strange thing, special, not of this world! When it appears, the energy in it is dark, you understand? And when a person takes such a "fresh" artifact, he can get hit by that same energy. Sometimes weak, sometimes more serious, and sometimes you can kick the bucket! True, right after an Emission they don't shock. Apparently they ripen. So watch it, Marked One, if you're weak in health, better rest up. Just in case!</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_114"><text>Thanks for the warning. Sidorovich, I'm here, well... you know...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_115"><text>What "you know"? What are you muttering under your nose?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_116"><text>Stas told me you won't let me die of hunger. I'm hungry as hell - no strength left.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_1171"><text>Oh my! Stas told him... Alright, our patient, here, have a bite, or you'll really die of starvation - did I invest in you for nothing? But remember - first and last time. This is the Zone - you have to pay for everything, literally and figuratively. That's it! Go get that artifact.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_1181"><text>Thanks for that, I suppose. I'll go see what these artifacts are about.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_1172"><text>Oh my! Stas told him... This isn't a free cafeteria. Go get that artifact.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_1182"><text>I'll go see what these artifacts are about.</text></string>

<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_201"><text>You're back... Where's the artifact?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2022"><text>I didn't find any artifact.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2021"><text>Found something spiky, is this it?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2031"><text>Ah! This is "Jellyfish", so-so artifact. Cheap. First level. And looks like it's degenerated too. That is, lost all anomalous properties. Sometimes that happens... </text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2041"><text>Degenerated? Well, okay. What does "first level" mean?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2023"><text>Here, found this black thing, what is it?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2033"><text>Ah! This is "Droplet", so-so artifact... Cheap. First level... Makes you tired, feel it?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2043"><text>That's why I'm looking terrible... What does "first level" mean?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2024"><text>Here, found this brown thing, what is it?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2034"><text>Ah! This is "Wrenched", so-so artifact... Cheap. First level... Bit radioactive, hope you didn't carry it in your pants?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2044"><text>That's why I'm looking terrible... What does "first level" mean?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2025"><text>Found something mangled, what is it?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2035"><text>Ah! This is "Stone Blood", so-so artifact... Cheap. First level... When you wear it, skin tears from the slightest damage...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2045"><text>That's why I'm looking terrible... What does "first level" mean?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2026"><text>Some kind of spike thing, what is it?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2036"><text>Well yes, spiky! This is "Thorn", so-so artifact... Cheap. First level... True, the prick from it is painfully strong - feeling normal?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2046"><text>Yeah, got scratched when I picked it up... Still bleeding... What does "first level" mean?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2027"><text>Here, found this little blue ball, what is it?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2037"><text>Ah! This "ball" is called "Sparkler", so-so artifact... Cheap. First level... It drains energy from people, are you hungry?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2047"><text>Exactly! I'm hungry as hell - no escape! What does "first level" mean?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2028"><text>Some snotty crap turned up. What's this?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2038"><text>Hmm... This snot is called "Slime", so-so artifact... Cheap. First level... True, God forbid you get burned with such an artifact - you'll burn up immediately.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2048"><text>That's why I felt terrible when I passed by the campfire... What does "first level" mean?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2029"><text>Found something mangled, what is it?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2039"><text>Oh! Nice artifact... Better than first level... For such a one I'll give you a nice pile of cash next time...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2049"><text>Oh my!... What does artifact "first" or whatever level mean?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2032"><text>Hmm, seems it's too early to do business with you, go rest up, and look some more...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_2042"><text>Don't grumble... I'll find it.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_205"><text>Seems you got hit real hard in the head... "First level" means the cheapest artifacts. Like "Jellyfish", "Stone Blood", or such. You won't earn much on them, because they're found quite often, and their anomalous properties are weak. "Second level" - already better! "Meat Chunk", "Flash"... Yeah... There's also "third level" - you won't find those just like that. They only come in shells, but for them you can raise good money.\nUse your brains! If you're a Stalker, you should know all these concepts anyway. Although... you're our brain-damaged one. Here, take this interesting little book. Everything about artifacts is written here, with pictures. Take a look.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_206"><text>Thanks, I'll definitely look. Ah! I remembered! Artifacts deflect bullets!</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_207"><text>Remembered, eh? Means you're definitely getting better. Artifacts have all kinds of properties. Some, as you correctly said, help protect from bullets, others make carried weight lighter, third ones let you jump further...\nBut for an artifact to "work", it needs to be sparked by an electrical discharge. For this, local craftsmen make special belts, and attach mesh cells for artifacts to them. In such a belt there's a converter that brings a spark from the battery to the artifact.\nHow many artifacts to wear at once, everyone decides for themselves. There's one catch here. Absolute protection doesn't exist, this is an ax-i-om. I don't know exactly how it works, I don't have academic degrees, but one graduate student who often drops by to get some "of this stuff" claims that the more artifacts with identical protective properties you have on your belt, the less positive effect each subsequent one will have, after reaching a certain threshold. So there... And the artifact mesh also has weight, you shouldn't forget about that either. Therefore it's not always reasonable to walk like a ballerina in such a "tutu" of artifact meshes. Two, three meshes - normal thing. But four or more are rarely hung on the belt, if you have a head on your shoulders, not a head of cabbage.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_208"><text>Belt with meshes? Hmm... How do you get one?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_209"><text>How-how... Buy, trade, earn... or take it off some stiff. A dead man doesn't need it anymore.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_210"><text>Off a stiff?! I'll keep that in mind.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_301"><text>Do you have any plans at all? What are you going to do?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_302"><text>I have nowhere to return to, who I am - I don't know yet. Doc said I need to look for those who can revive my memory.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_303"><text>That's true... Only people don't live long in the Zone, believe me - I know. I think you need to make your way to the center. There you can mainly meet those who have already walked this Zone far and wide. Maybe you'll find someone who can give answers to your questions. And maybe someone will recognize you.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_304"><text>Seems that's how it'll have to be.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_305"><text>For life in the Zone you need a lot of things, first of all - weapons. Want to earn some?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_306"><text>It's not about wanting - it's a necessity. What needs to be done?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_307"><text>One stalker, a complete newbie... they found someone to entrust it to... Anyway, a courier was carrying an artifact to me. Only he didn't deliver it! Came running to the camp, shaking all over, wet, pale. As I understood, he passed the bridge, but then... Says a bunch of monsters attacked, had to drop the container. Either near the old elevator, or near the ATP... Seems he completely lost his head from fear. One word - Butterfingers! You should go to him, maybe he'll tell you more coherently. He's around here somewhere, hiding in the village, damn him...\nThe artifact there is unique, and it's a good container - worth big money! Just don't dawdle, drag it right away when you find it. If you bring it, so be it - you'll get a gun.\nI'm giving you a medkit with bandages, just in case.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_3081"><text>Butterfingers, you say... I'll go look for this newbie.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_3082"><text>Listen, Sidorovich, creatures are running around there, and I don't even have weapons! And I don't feel like I have strength for heroics yet...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_309"><text>Yes! Wait a bit. Good advice for you. Notice, I'm giving it for free! Don't mess with the local military! We have an unspoken agreement here: we don't touch them, they don't touch us. Got it?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_310"><text>What the hell do I need them for?!</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_401"><text>So, did you find the container? Is the artifact in it?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_4021"><text>Found it, found it. This container?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_4033"><text>Yeah... Looks like you're really still too weak to wander the Zone. You know Wolf? He's like a father figure to the newbies here. Go to him - have a chat, maybe he'll help you with a decent gun. And I'll send someone else for the container, don't bother.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_4043"><text>Wolf? I'll go meet him.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_4045"><text>Uh, looks like that Wolf kicked the bucket.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_407"><text>How's that? He was an experienced stalker! What a mess. He owed me something... You're saying you'd want a better gun? There's this one job here, left unfinished by Wolf, eternal memory to him. So, how about it? Shall we figure something out?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_408"><text>You'd better, respected sir, get to the point...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_409"><text>Hmm. Right - fewer words, more action. Need to find one document. One of Wolf's men disappeared with this document. As I was told - not very far, in a tunnel under the railway track north of here. Wolf himself wanted to go, but you see - such bad luck... So, here's the deal: there are documents from one old trader - there's an assault rifle for Marked One, no documents - no assault rifle for free... Fair enough?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_4101"><text>Found a speed demon, alright, I'll try...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_4102"><text>My eyes are already going dark, find someone else...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_411"><text>Someone else? Well then, alright. Go, sick one, get your health back...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_412"><text>You... don't be mad, I really feel terrible.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_4024"><text>No container! Someone probably dragged it off.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_4034"><text>That's, bitch... Well, never mind, Butterfingers will work that container off to me! He'll remember it forever...\nYou should get a better gun or something. Wolf is looking for a volunteer to hop over not far from here, promised some kind of assault rifle... Talk to him...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_4044"><text>Wolf? Alright, we'll see...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_40311"><text>But the artifact? Open it up, take a look. Otherwise who knows... Maybe it's empty.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_40312"><text>It's there, burns like hell! Take it quick.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_40313"><text>Huh? Open it? Wait, let me.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_4022"><text>Container? Haven't found it yet. I'll keep looking...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_4031"><text>What can I say... Well done, Marked One! Here, take a pistol and a couple packs of ammo for it. Honestly earned.\nGot a bit scorched, you say?\nTake some antirad - it'll get better.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_40411"><text>Thank you, of course, only...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_40412"><text>Stop, where are you shoving those cartridges in your backpack! By the time you get them out, they'll tear you apart and eat you ten times over. Here, take this belt with an ammo pouch. Eh, what a head! Two ears... I think you won't forget my kindness again.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_40413"><text>Stop, where are you shoving those cartridges in your backpack! By the time you get them out, they'll tear you apart and eat you ten times over. You have an ammo pouch. Load the magazine and put it in the pouch, one, two and you're reloaded!</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_4041"><text>Yeah, somehow I... Sidorovich, the pistol isn't very serious weapon.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_405"><text>And I'm not the "Red Cross". If I give everyone a good gun for free, I'll go bankrupt, God forbid.\nGo to Wolf, he's the elder here, in the camp. He was looking for a man for one assignment, maybe you'll come to an agreement.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_406"><text>Let's see what kind of Wolf this is.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_501"><text>Listen, Marked One, we have a little problem here, there's a chance to distinguish yourself.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_502"><text>What do I care about your problems?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_503"><text>Judge for yourself: you help me, and I'll help you. Maybe I'll learn about someone who could have known you.\nSo far the only thread to your past is that you kept repeating Strelok's name in delirium. And about Strelok and his team there were all kinds of rumors at one time.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_504"><text>Here you calculated me correctly - I can't live with a "black hole" instead of memory. So what do you need from me?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_505"><text>So here's the thing, Marked One. One courier - called Nimble - was carrying some information to me. And disappeared. Right nearby, under our nose, because there was a message from him saying he was already on Cordon. I don't know what to think. Maybe he decided to dump the info to someone else or he's sitting drinking vodka? In short: find Nimble, alive or dead - main thing is that the flash drive is with him. Bring me the flash drive. Nimble was one of Wolf's men, ask around, maybe someone knows something.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_506"><text>Agreed.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_601"><text>Marked One, what are you doing here? I told you: go look for Nimble!</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_6021"><text>I already found him. Here's the flash drive.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_6022"><text>Wait with the pressure, I need to stock up on some things.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_60221"><text>Money, artifacts - what do you have?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_6023"><text>I found him already, his corpse.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_60232"><text>I found him already, his corpse.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_604"><text>What corpse? What about the flash drive? Information? Where?\nUgh... Something's been going wrong lately. Yeah. Well alright, you didn't refuse to help, here take this simple tactical vest from me. It's more convenient to run around the Zone with it. You can try to get a special forces model through the soldiers later. There are extra pockets there, and more fits in them.\nThat's it, go now. If you need anything - drop by, we'll discuss it, to mutual benefit.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_6041"><text>What corpse? What about the flash drive? Information? Where?\nUgh... Something's been going wrong lately. Yeah.\nWell. God gave, God took. Fate. Well, and you... Anyway, if you need anything - drop by.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_6042"><text>What corpse? What about the flash drive? Information? Where?\nUgh... Something's been going wrong lately. Yeah. Well alright, you didn't refuse to help, here take some cartridges and vodka - to relieve stress.\nIf you need anything - drop by, we'll discuss it - to mutual benefit.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_605"><text>Well... See ya.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_606"><text>Wait a second. You'll have to wander all over the Zone? Do you remember that it's not safe here?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_607"><text>Yeah, I can see that already. Anomalies, all sorts of creatures just trying to devour me.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_608"><text>Yeah, those are, so to speak, obvious dangers. At least you can somehow detect them. There are some other contagions that you can't detect at all. Like viruses. Completely invisible. Here on Cordon they don't seem to manifest very strongly, which is understandable - it's the outskirts, but the closer to the center, the worse it gets. So I'm telling you right away - without respiratory protection, it would be better for a person not to stay there long. Understand?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_609"><text>Constantly walk in a gas mask? Yeah...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_603"><text>Excellent! Now I really see - you're a worthy person.\nI see you got a tactical vest? Right. For serious business you need to equip yourself more seriously! Here take some cartridges and vodka - to relieve stress.\nYou can contact me if you need anything else.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_6031"><text>Excellent! Now I really see - you're a worthy person.\nI see you're still walking around with one ammo pouch, for serious business you need to equip yourself more seriously! Here take this simple tactical vest from me as thanks. It's more convenient to run around the Zone with it. You can try to get a special forces model through the soldiers later. There are extra pockets there, and more fits in them.\nThat's it, go now. If you need anything - drop by, we'll discuss it, to mutual benefit.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_701"><text>Marked One... What did you want? Sell artifacts, buy gear or something else?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_801"><text>What's up, Marked One?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_8021"><text>Just dropping by.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_8022"><text>Here's the thing...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_803"><text>Eh, Marked One. I understand, of course - you hit your head and all that, but you could think a bit faster, you know.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_901"><text>Marked One. I warned you! I don't do business with those who break up all my commerce! Get out of here... nicely.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_902"><text>Well, screw you then! I'll manage without you!</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_951"><text>Listen, do you have a conscience? Let a man sleep!</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_952"><text>Uh...</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_971"><text>Oh! Marked One. And I thought you rushed off to the Radar with everyone else, you haven't been showing up.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_972"><text>I was there. Nothing good there. Let the fools rush there if they're tired of living.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_973"><text>And you, it seems, finally got smarter. Or remembered something?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_974"><text>Hell knows... It's like the opposite - some kind of gap in memory, two weeks flew by like one day, and unclear how. Probably still some consequences from that truck ride. I don't even know what will happen next.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_975"><text>What, you got knocked out again? Yeah, bro, I don't envy you. You should spit on everything, live here for a month, recover, you've gotten completely thin, there's no face left on you.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_976"><text>I would have spat earlier, but I can't anymore. There's no point in stopping now - I need to go to the end.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_977"><text>So again there - to the north? Well, have a good journey... You're not the only one striving there. Vergas also seems to have gotten a bee in his bonnet. Packed his belongings and left.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_978"><text>Vergas went north? You're joking?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_979"><text>What jokes are there! Out of the blue he suddenly got ready and shuffled off. Not alone, of course. Where would he go! He went with a guide. I tell him, where are you going with your hemorrhoids, you'd sit here and know no troubles. No. Must go. They're waiting for him there, you see.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_9791"><text>Who's waiting?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_9792"><text>How should I know. Everyone's gone crazy recently, rushing north in herds. So you don't dawdle either, or they'll snatch everything up there.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_new_start_dialog_991"><text>Help with what? Or maybe you want to gear up a bit first?</text></string>

<string id="what_do_to_do_0"><text>I'm thinking, what should I do next?</text></string>
<string id="what_do_to_do_1"><text>What should you do... Head not working? You wanted to find acquaintances. Found any here, no? So you need to head to the center of the Zone, look for acquaintances. Right? So go... north. There's the Bar, and other places where you can meet those who have been trampling the Zone long enough.\nGet it? NORTH. There's no other way. Let me mark where that is for you.</text></string>
<string id="what_do_to_do_2"><text>Yes, there's no other way.</text></string>
<string id="what_do_to_do_3"><text>Only I wouldn't rush there in your place. Where will you go now - naked as a jaybird. Live here a little, get used to it, make connections, work to at least get some gear. You're walking around like a tramp.</text></string>
<string id="what_do_to_do_4"><text>Cheap labor needed, right?</text></string>
<string id="what_do_to_do_5"><text>I'm giving you advice, and you're getting all huffy. But as you wish... Ah! By the way. There, on the way to the Bar, there's a small post of the duty guys. Well, those who are trying to protect the world from the Zone. Some protectors. So now, this post is commanded by Prapor. Hell knows, maybe really a former warrant officer. He was here not long ago and promised to show me one thing that came to him by chance. Promised to send a messenger. But there's neither sight nor sound. If you see him - ask how that matter is going. Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="what_do_to_do_6"><text>Prapor? I'll ask, when I get the chance.</text></string>

<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_101"><text>Hey. Why did you come?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_102"><text>I need Nimble. Can you tell me where to find him?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_103"><text>A bad thing happened to Nimble... Bandits took him nearby and dragged him off, he only managed to send an SOS. The bandits are now at the old ATP, beyond the road.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_104"><text>Don't you rescue your own from captivity? Not very friendly...</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_105"><text>Eh, I'd punch you, but what's the use? It's not that simple. I have few men, and they're all complete newbies. I can't risk it. If we lose this camp, all normal stalkers will have a hard time. And what about you yourself? If you don't chicken out, I won't refuse help, I'm not proud. Will you help deal with the bandits?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_106"><text>You're suggesting going alone?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_107"><text>No, you won't manage that way. My scouts are real fighters. Right now they're watching those freaks. Together you have pretty good chances, in principle. Or is it still too much?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_1081"><text>I'll try.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_1082"><text>Not too much. But I won't go.</text></string>

<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_1092"><text>So it is too much after all... Well, get the hell out of here!</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_1093"><text>Yeah... I think there really won't be any use from you... Didn't complete my assignment, let Sidor down with the container too. No, Marked One, I don't have a gun for you. Only later, when you help rescue Nimble... Petruha with his eagles are ready to start making noise there, maybe at least you'll distract the bandits' attention or scout the approaches. In short, you'll figure it out on the spot. Drink some vodka, for courage... Ready? Or chickened out?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_1094"><text>Alright, let's see what's there.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_1095"><text>Don't worry! I'll warn the guys about you now.</text></string>

<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_215"><text>Managed to negotiate with the bandits. Nimble was freed.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_2151"><text>Excellent! Didn't expect it, honestly. There must be something special in you... Here, take this as appreciation from the stalker community.</text></string>

<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_21211"><text>Great.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_213"><text>In progress.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_2131"><text>Keep me posted, alright?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_214"><text>About ten bandits at the ATP. We won't manage on our own.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_2141"><text>Ten? Where did so many come from? Damn... Where's Petruha looking. Said he could handle it. Can't, of course, charge in headfirst - we'll lose Nimble and many more. Listen, you're not too exposed? Let's try to find out what these freaks want. Will you take on going to them?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_21421"><text>No way! I'm not putting my head in the mouth.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_21422"><text>Could try, but what if they shoot without talking?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_21431"><text>I'll try to send someone else. And you... Walk around...</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_21432"><text>They shouldn't. The main thing is don't rattle your gear in front of them. Go in a sweater, so they immediately see you're not hiding a gun under your clothes. If you're worried about your loot, you can leave all the valuable stuff right in the village, I'll keep an eye on it. But remember, this is only while you're helping with freeing Nimble.\nAnyway, find out there what the bandits want from him. Don't play hero too much, talk and run back. Then we'll decide what to do. Just give Petruha a heads-up not to make any moves yet.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_volk_new_talk_216"><text>I have bad news. Nimble is dead.</text></string>

<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_106"><text>Well, as you wish... Then... They're probably waiting for you beyond the perimeter. They think you'll return, help your relatives. So I can throw in some money, for you and your loved ones.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_107"><text>I know about your money. What good are they to me? What's your name, stalker?</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_108"><text>Marked One... And this money can later be converted to more significant currency - dollars for example. Ask your replacement, he'll paint you a picture. There's one old coot in the village, he easily converts these rubles into decent money. And you'll leave the Zone limits with big bucks. How about this: I give you... two thousand, and you and your eagles see nothing for ten minutes?</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_109"><text>Uh... Currency you say, dollars? Then, exceptionally... three thousand from you. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_1091"><text>Hmm... Take the rubles.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_1092"><text>You got a taste for it quick. Don't have that much.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_110"><text>Pass through... Just quickly.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_111"><text>Running, running...</text></string>

<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_201"><text>Marked One! It's you again?</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_202"><text>How's service, lieutenant, everything good? Need to pass.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_203"><text>Mmm, got money, three thousand? Hand it over, then you'll pass.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_2041"><text>I do, take it.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_2042"><text>Haven't saved up yet.</text></string>

<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_301"><text>Hey! You there! Come on, pass quickly.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_302"><text>Passing.</text></string>

<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_401"><text>Marked One! Still running around?</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_402"><text>Good health to you too, lieutenant. Need to pass.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_403"><text>They already brought me orders to let you through without delay. Only I can't figure out, for what merits.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_404"><text>Maybe I'm a secret agent... Work in intelligence.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_405"><text>Always joking... spy.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_406"><text>And don't you be sad. Or do you feel sorry for my blood rubles? Don't be down. If not me, someone else will pay. So... can I pass?</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_407"><text>Go, I won't delay you.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_408"><text>That's better, stay healthy.</text></string>

<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_501"><text>You again? What did you want?</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_5021"><text>Need to pass...</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_5022"><text>Wish you health and all that.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_503"><text>Why ask if you know I'll let you through? Go.</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_504"><text>Just for order, army after all...</text></string>
<!-- это кто? -->
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_601"><text>Get out of here, stalker...</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_602"><text>Already gone...</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_701"><text>Stalker, turn around, while we're being nice...</text></string>
<string id="esc_bridge_soldiers_sub_new_start_702"><text>Look at that...</text></string>

<string id="stas"><text>Stas the guard</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_101"><text>Stop stalker! Why are you here?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_0"><text>Well I'm stopping. What's next?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_1"><text>Word went around - Sidorovich was marked for death... So he asked to keep an eye on you stalkers. Just in case...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_2"><text>Sidorovich? Who's that?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_3"><text>Fell from the moon? Ah! You're that one... Deadman...\nSidorovich is the local merchant... Trader, but with principles. He'll throw you work, won't let you starve, help with advice. Not for free, of course. You have to pay for everything in this world!</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_4"><text>And what currency does he prefer? Pounds? Dollars? Hryvnias?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_5"><text>He'll tell you himself... If he's in the mood.\nSo what did you want?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_6"><text>Don't know. Makes me sick. Doc said to come here. Like I owe something.</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_7"><text>Well yeah, you owe. If Sidor hadn't been interested in a living corpse, the good doggies would be gnawing your bones. So be grateful and don't get uppity. Deal?\nAnd here's something else. If you need to leave something valuable in storage, come to me. I'll keep watch for a small fee.</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_8"><text>Alright... I need to see Sidorovich.</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_9"><text>Go in... Watch it there....</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_201"><text>Hey there... Going to Sidorovich?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_2021"><text>Yes, to Sidorovich, will you let me?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_2022"><text>No, to you...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_2031"><text>Well go in... Don't forget, I'm watching everyone...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_204"><text>Alright, alright...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_2033"><text>It's late already, Sidorovich went to sleep.</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_2035"><text>He won't be here for a couple days...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_401"><text>It's you... Why can't you sleep...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_402"><text>Where's Sidorovich?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_403"><text>Man's sleeping. Resting. You should go too... Rest...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_501"><text>Hey, Marked One... What did you want?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_502"><text>What are you doing here? I wanted to visit Sidorovich...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_503"><text>Sidorovich left on business, promised to return in a couple days.</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_601"><text>It's you... Why can't you sleep...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_602"><text>I need Sidorovich, will he be here in the morning?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_603"><text>Sidorovich left on business, promised to return in a couple days...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_2032"><text>To me? What's the occasion?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_301"><text>How long will you keep loitering here?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_701"><text>It's you... Not allowed to let you in! Go away!</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_1_702"><text>Screw you!</text></string>

<string id="stas_dialog_2_0"><text>Need to store some loot.</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_1"><text>No problem. Got any artifact for me? Three days you can use the safe anytime. Keep in mind, the capacity of the provided storage depends on your reputation in stalker circles.</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_12"><text>Well, your safe usage time hasn't expired yet. Maybe need to extend? Artifact - and three days access.</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_131"><text>No, just open it, we'll see then.</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_11"><text>It's night, come in the morning...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_111"><text>Can't do anything now, Sidorovich left for a couple days and locked the door.</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_2"><text>Well here, take "Jellyfish"...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_21"><text>Giving "Wrenched"...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_3"><text>Can give "Stone Blood"...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_31"><text>Artifact "Droplet"...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_4"><text>"Sparkler" here...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_41"><text>Take "Slime"...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_42"><text>Will you take "Thorn"?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_5"><text>Artifacts are in short supply with me, maybe you'll take money?</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_61"><text>Where would I use those papers... Well fine... Exceptionally.</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_71"><text>Thanks! Take the money.</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_72"><text>Man, you set some price...</text></string>
<string id="stas_dialog_2_6"><text>Excellent! Hide the loot in the box in the cabinet. I won't look...</text></string>

<string id="kastet_start_dialog_101"><text>Stop stalker! Why are you here?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_0"><text>Uh... Well I'm stopping. What's next?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_1"><text>Just don't twitch... Now carefully give me all your guns.</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_2"><text>What for? I've been here a hundred times! Where's Stas?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_3"><text>Stas was killed. Haven't you heard about it? Couple thugs broke in... As Sidorovich says - came on a tip. One of the stalkers apparently had the richest loot stored here with Stas. So he kept storing it. Sidor, while the matter was being sorted out, grabbed his legs and rushed through his underground passage for help.</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_4"><text>Did they catch the thugs?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_5"><text>What do you mean. I'm saying - it was a tip. They only robbed one safe quickly. Artifacts, they say, were countless there! So they left with those artifacts... </text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_6"><text>And is it known whose safe was robbed?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_7"><text>Yeah, there's one here, lucky one... And why, you ask, hoard without measure?\nGreed is a mortal sin!\nNo... They'll choke on it, but grab and grab... Marked One is his handle... Haven't met him?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_8"><text>Uh... That's me...</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_9"><text>You? Because of you, greedy idiot, Stas got whacked...\nAlright. Maybe it's not because of you. I got heated.\nIn short, want to enter - hand over your guns!</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_201"><text>Hey there... Going to Sidorovich?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_2021"><text>Yeah to him, on business.</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_2022"><text>No. Changed my mind... See ya.</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_2031"><text>Hand over your guns. I don't trust anyone.</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_2041"><text>Alright, alright... Here take this.</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_205"><text>You'll get them on the way out. You can go in.</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_2042"><text>No way! I'll do without Sidor.</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_2033"><text>It's night already, Sidorovich went to sleep.</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_2035"><text>He left, on his business for a couple days...</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_401"><text>It's you... Why can't you sleep...</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_402"><text>Where's Sidorovich?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_403"><text>Man's sleeping. Resting. You should go too... Rest...</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_501"><text>Marked One... What did you want?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_502"><text>Sidor left again? Or just locked himself in?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_503"><text>Left, left... You go on..</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_601"><text>It's you... Why can't you sleep...</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_602"><text>I need Sidorovich, will he be here in the morning?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_603"><text>Sidorovich left on business, promised to return in a couple days...</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_301"><text>So? Done trading?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_302"><text>Yeah, give me the weapons, I'm going.</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_303"><text>Wait a sec... Follow me.</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_701"><text>It's you... Not allowed to let you in! Go away!</text></string>
<string id="kastet_start_dialog_702"><text>Screw you!</text></string>

<string id="kastet_go_out_dialog_601"><text>It's you... Why can't you sleep...</text></string>
<string id="kastet_go_out_dialog_602"><text>I need Sidorovich, will he be here in the morning?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_go_out_dialog_603"><text>Sidorovich left on business, promised to return in a couple days...</text></string>
<string id="kastet_go_out_dialog_301"><text>So? Done trading?</text></string>
<string id="kastet_go_out_dialog_302"><text>Yeah, give me the weapons, I'm going.</text></string>
<string id="kastet_go_out_dialog_303"><text>Take it. See ya...</text></string>
<string id="kastet_go_out_dialog_701"><text>It's you... Not allowed to let you in! Go away!</text></string>
<string id="kastet_go_out_dialog_702"><text>Screw you!</text></string>

<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog_0"><text>I heard you have a new "Pernach" pistol...</text></string>
<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog_1"><text>Ha, what gossips! Everyone knows everything. Well yes, there is. They sent a couple of such guns from Kiev. Only the use of these popguns is zero! What did you want?</text></string>
<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog_2"><text>I'd like to test this "popgun" in action. Can I get it somehow?</text></string>
<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog_3"><text>Of course you can! You seem to know my interest. Will you run to Sidor, bring some vodka? A little, ten bottles... no, let's make it a dozen.</text></string>
<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog_41"><text>Yeah I got some, here, take it.</text></string>
<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog_42"><text>Alright, I'll be right back...</text></string>
<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog_43"><text>Nah, this peashooter ain't worth it.</text></string>
<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog_51"><text>That's good. Take it, use it.</text></string>

<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog2_0"><text>Brought vodka as promised...</text></string>
<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog2_1"><text>Vodka? That's good. Did we have a deal? I don't remember something...</text></string>
<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog2_2"><text>How could you not? For the new "Pernach" pistol. We agreed on a dozen bottles...</text></string>
<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog2_3"><text>Don't shout so loud! I remember everything, I remember... Come on, unload the white stuff here, just quietly. You never know, an inspector might show up. Everything's been restless lately.</text></string>
<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog2_4"><text>Alright, as you say.</text></string>
<string id="tm_find_fort_m1_dialog2_5"><text>Yeah, everything's good. Take this popgun and get out of here quick. I still need to give the boys a lecture...</text></string>

<string id="lukash_dialog_1_0"><text>Can I ask? About your announcements.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_1_1"><text>Announcements? What kind? What do you need?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_1_2"><text>Can I leave some things with you for safekeeping?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_1_3"><text>In principle, yes... But as you understand, this service isn't free.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_1_4"><text>I understand - not my first day in the Zone... What do you need for it?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_1_5"><text>Artifacts, of course! Not very valuable, but still... Give a second level artifact and you have access to the stash anytime for three days.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_1_6"><text>Good, if I need it, I'll come to you...</text></string>
	
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_0"><text>Want to store some loot.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_11"><text>Well, you pay honestly, we store honestly. Go downstairs and put your stuff.\nMaybe you want to extend the time?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_121"><text>No, I'll just put what I wanted.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_122"><text>Probably really time to extend.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_123"><text>Second level artifact and you don't have to worry about your stuff for three days. Anytime day or night you can take everything you stored.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_1"><text>Second level artifact from you and you don't have to worry about your stuff for three days. Anytime day or night you can take everything you stored.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_2"><text>Here, got "Stone Flower".</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_3"><text>Can give "Gravi".</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_4"><text>Got "Meat Chunk".</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_7"><text>Can offer "Flash".</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_8"><text>Will "Fireball" do?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_9"><text>Will you take "Slug"?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_10"><text>"Crystal Thorn" in stock.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_20"><text>Trouble with artifacts! Maybe I'll pay some other way?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_21"><text>I understand. Artifacts are important... Let's do this: you leave me purely symbolic payment, and we'll keep your loot until better times for you. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_22"><text>Purely symbolic payment - how much is that?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_23"><text>For you. Today only. Uh...</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_241"><text>Well yes... Funny... Here, take this.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_242"><text>For one time? No, I'd rather hide it myself!</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_5"><text>Don't have anything yet, I'll come back later.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_dialog_2_6"><text>Alright! On the first floor in the armory you can put everything. The guard will open the safe.</text></string>
	
<string id="jila_dialog_1_0"><text>Want to ask about something.</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_1_11"><text>Yeah? Well, start talkin'.</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_1_12"><text>Yeah? First explain to me in one go. Borov sent boys to Cordon, to settle some matters. My pal was the foreman - Benya Zaporozhsky. Haven't met such a guy?</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_1_21"><text>Got some loot together and afraid it'll disappear...</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_1_22"><text>Don't recall. Why?</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_1_31"><text>Give me your loot, I'll take it for safekeeping. Not one mutt will touch it - they respect me here.\nBut you owe me!</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_1_32"><text>Because people pointed at you. You were hanging around ATP when our guys were there. And they also say you stood up for some stalker, you had some kind of deal with Benya. Was that so?</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_1_41"><text>Maybe a bit later. What will you take for storage?</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_1_42"><text>Ah! Now I remember. Well, yeah. We parted peacefully. Everyone got what they wanted.</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_1_51"><text>We got problems with normal grub, so bring decent chow. For a couple cans or two bottles of energy drink - we'll be completely satisfied.</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_1_52"><text>Peacefully? But they whacked both Benya and the boys when they were returning to the Valley. They whispered to me, this was your handiwork. What you got to say?</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_1_61"><text>Food, then... Cans or energy drink. Clear, noted!</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_1_62"><text>Wanna take it on pure bluff? Ask your whisperers about their rotten talk. Don't throw baseless accusations at me. Someone's word against mine. In short, don't know who wasted all your guys, but it definitely wasn't me.</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_1_72"><text>How do you know it was all of them? You're a shady type, Marked One, and there's no trust for you. But you're right about one thing - I got no real proof, so... Roll away with your questions, got it?</text></string>
	
<string id="jila_dialog_2_0"><text>Hey there, Veins, will you take loot for safekeeping?</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_2_1"><text>Let's see... Got grub, drinks?</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_2_2"><text>Got a couple cans.</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_2_3"><text>Water - couple bottles.</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_2_4"><text>Ate it all myself.</text></string>
<string id="jila_dialog_2_5"><text>A deal's worth more than money! Put it in that cabinet, not one scumbag will get in.</text></string>

<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_1_0"><text>Good day, I have a request.</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_1_1"><text>Good day. What kind of request? I hope nothing like that...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_1_2"><text>No no, I want to leave loot for safekeeping. To be sure it won't disappear...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_1_3"><text>Well what can I say... Nobody's complained yet!\nAs you understand - security isn't cheap, so you need to pay up for storage access. Just keep in mind, your loot won't be stored forever. If the owner doesn't show up for a long time, the contents go to Duty. This is the Zone, those are the rules.</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_1_4"><text>I see. How much will access cost?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_1_5"><text>For one time - only about five thousand rubles...\nCan arrange for three days - unlimited access will cost around fifteen thousand...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_1_6"><text>Understood, I'll keep it in mind.</text></string>
	
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_0"><text>Please accept something for storage.</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_104"><text>Let me remind you, haven't you forgotten? You owe... Double for that time, and this time another sum... Won't count - you know yourself. So? Haven't lost the desire yet?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_105"><text>Yeah I remember. Here's the money. That all?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_1"><text>Alright, pay for one time? Or for three days? Got money with you?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_11"><text>Rental period hasn't expired yet, you can use it... But maybe extend?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_12"><text>Of course, no problem! I understand - we let you down... Won't happen again... Word of DUTY!</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_31"><text>No, won't extend for now...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_2"><text>I'll pay for one-time access.</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_21"><text>I'll take three days, here's the money.</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_9"><text>I got a situation. No money in the account right now. Maybe you'll trust me?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_7"><text>On trust? Hmm... Alright, I'm trusting, apparently... So here's how - I give you access now, and you pay double later. So, deal?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_8"><text>Alright, deal... I'll pay double...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_5"><text>I'll think about it... Don't really need it for now.</text></string>
<string id="voronin_seif_dialog_2_6"><text>Well then, go to the armory, the cabinet's open. Put your stuff in storage. Don't worry - we guarantee safekeeping! Word of "Duty"!</text></string>

<string id="sak_seif_dialog_1_0"><text>Can I leave something with you for a while?</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_1_1"><text>Things are material substance, that is - short-lived... Giving this amorphous component of being practicality tears away mental energy...</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_1_2"><text>Yeah... So what? If I leave it, will you watch it? I can give something for watching. Well, artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_1_3"><text>Fruits of otherworld do not inspire interest in beings...</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_1_4"><text>What does inspire?</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_1_5"><text>Mind seeks and finds... Mortal flesh binds to material being. For human flesh needs aids known to people. Which help preserve flesh in this piece of universe... You, humans, call them medicines...</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_1_6"><text>I see, so - medkits.</text></string>
	
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_2_0"><text>Leave loot for safekeeping? Just say it simpler!</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_2_1"><text>You can leave your inanimate entities... Support human flesh of seekers with healing elements...</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_2_2"><text>My own flesh is in suffering. Damn devil, I'm starting to talk like him! What exactly do you need? Please just - say it humanly!</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_2_3"><text>Ehh... Healing sets of simple name - paired essence or singular other appearances...</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_2_41"><text>Here are simple medkits. Think I'll manage.</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_2_42"><text>I got military medkit, here...</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_2_43"><text>Just got scientific medkit. Take it.</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_2_44"><text>Here are antirad. You really need them here!</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_2_6"><text>Essence accepted... Information coordinated... You can store what you have...</text></string>
<string id="sak_seif_dialog_2_23"><text>Hmm... No. I'll wait for now...</text></string>

<string id="prip_sleep_need_dialog_0"><text>I need to pass the night, eyes are closing.</text></string>
<string id="prip_sleep_need_dialog_1"><text>You are still weak in flesh, human. Only one who perceives with inner sight the openness of mind can...</text></string>
<string id="prip_sleep_need_dialog_2"><text>Yes-yes. So can I lie down here?</text></string>
<string id="prip_sleep_need_dialog_31"><text>Yes... Time of darkness brings danger, forces of simple humans cannot resist it. You can lay down the mortality of your body near brother who gives nourishment. Let his Gift be revealed to you...</text></string>
<string id="prip_sleep_need_dialog_4"><text>Yeah, let it. At least I'll get some sleep.</text></string>
<string id="prip_sleep_need_dialog_32"><text>Day is not yet finished, which means revelation has not come to you. Seek it! Gain strength of thought and open mind to his Gift...</text></string>
<string id="prip_sleep_need_dialog_5"><text>What?..</text></string>

<string id="prip_monolith_info_dialog_0"><text>Hmm, I see - lights are on, sausage with bread... Where from?</text></string>
<string id="prip_monolith_info_dialog_1"><text>Mind of seekers, understanding ones, enlightened... Common mentality in cloud of consciousness can influence... And reach...</text></string>
<string id="prip_monolith_info_dialog_2"><text>Don't understand anything! What does consciousness have to do with it?</text></string>
<string id="prip_monolith_info_dialog_3"><text>Difficult with you... Humans. Walking in darkness. But there is hope for initiation. I will try. To say. Simpler.\nBrother "Enlightened" immerses his consciousness into common field of mentality. Envelops with thought informational likeness of physical entities. And carries through barrier separating spiritual and physical. And physical substance establishes itself in world. And becomes likeness. So it happens.</text></string>
<string id="prip_monolith_info_dialog_4"><text>I understand that all this food is made to appear by power of thought by that guy nodding his head? And this only works on food? Or on something else too?</text></string>
<string id="prip_monolith_info_dialog_5"><text>There is no limit for "Enlightened"... Depth of retention and brain limitations of flesh - bring boundaries for given individual... Common mind can more... Much more...</text></string>
<string id="prip_monolith_info_dialog_6"><text>Damn... Thought a little - and here's a snack, frowned - gun with ammo... Would be interesting... Although no. Not interesting...</text></string>

<string id="volk_teleport_anomalies_0"><text>Wolf, you're an experienced stalker, explain one thing to me...</text></string>
<string id="volk_teleport_anomalies_1"><text>What thing?</text></string>
<string id="volk_teleport_anomalies_2"><text>I exit the village, and someone hits me on the head, I come to in a house basement...</text></string>
<string id="volk_teleport_anomalies_3"><text>And double vision? And head cracks like from a hangover?</text></string>
<string id="volk_teleport_anomalies_4"><text>Yeah, serious withdrawal...</text></string>
<string id="volk_teleport_anomalies_5"><text>You got caught in an anomaly, we call it "Bungee" among ourselves. The eggheads, of course, say it differently - "Spatial-teleportation tunnel, with instant transfer effect"... Can break your tongue! Recently such anomalies started appearing, some are clearly visible, others audible, and the third ones - the most vicious, can't be detected at all.</text></string>
<string id="volk_teleport_anomalies_6"><text>And how do they work?</text></string>
<string id="volk_teleport_anomalies_7"><text>If I knew HOW, I wouldn't be sitting here, but in some Western university making serious cash. But generally, we noticed - it only throws humans, completely ignores bolts or animals. Can carry you anywhere - that's what makes these "Bungees" dangerous.</text></string>
<string id="volk_teleport_anomalies_8"><text>Just what we needed...</text></string>

<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_101"><text>Stalker... I'm in bad shape... You...</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_102"><text>Fox? Sidorovich sent me.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_103"><text>I... Feel like shit, bro, got a medkit?</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_1041"><text>Sure, here... Well, how is it?</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_1042"><text>Sorry, I don't have a medkit, barely holding on myself.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_201"><text>Thanks! Need a doctor... They said he's somewhere here, on Cordon. But I didn't make it.\nWho are you anyway? Where are you going?</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_202"><text>Don't know. I lost my memory. Sidorovich dubbed me Marked One. Going north for now, will look for acquaintances or familiar places... You, they say, might know something about Strelok, and he seems to be a thread to my past. Will you tell me about him?</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_203"><text>Marked One, then. Alright.\nI heard about Strelok and his group, can even say I "communicated" with them - once his group fired at my boys. Nobody got hurt - they were clearly waiting for others, so we parted peacefully after that. Cursed each other across the ravine and went separate ways. Seriy, a stalker I know, he's at Garbage now I think, he should know more about Strelok.\nListen, there's a pack of dogs following my trail. Need to deal with them, then we'll continue talking, okay?</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_204"><text>Can you handle it yourself? Or help?</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_205"><text>I can barely stand, vision's doubled. But where can I go. They'll tear me apart otherwise.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_2061"><text>Alright, I'll try to help you.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_2062"><text>Well, I have my own path, good luck.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_351"><text>Watch your sides, friend! They'll come running again now.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_352"><text>Yeah.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_301"><text>Thanks a lot, Marked One. I probably wouldn't have managed alone: you saw what a pack it was.\nTake some ammo. Just right for dogs.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_302"><text>Come on, I helped you, you help me...</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_303"><text>If you can, help another person.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_401"><text>Greetings, Marked One!</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_501"><text>Wanted to go, so go.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_502"><text>Alright, don't get worked up.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_601"><text>Oh! And I was just thinking about you. People are telling tales about Marked One - like such a sneaky one...\nMeaning been everywhere normal stalkers don't go.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_602"><text>Yeah, had to run around.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_603"><text>We talked it over with the guys, and with sound reasoning, decided to get out. Good that you came by. I remembered there's one unfinished business, it might concern you too. Think I'll tell Marked One, let him decide what to do with it.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_604"><text>Yeah? What kind of business?</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_605"><text>We were sitting out at Tesla with Hermit once, waiting out an emission. And under "this business" conversation turned to Zone wonders and more. And among other things there was talk that everything that ever was, it doesn't disappear without trace, but gets recorded in some field. And that those who pretend to be clairvoyants actually can just connect to this field.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_606"><text>Well, and?</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_607"><text>In short. Hermit said he knew one brainy stalker who had the gift of clairvoyance. And that stalker told him there are places in the Zone that allow ordinary person to get into this information field and get practically any knowledge. There you go.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_608"><text>Interesting. What's this Hermit about? And what's your "unfinished" business, you didn't bring this up for nothing?</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_609"><text>Don't know about Hermit? Actually more often he's called Brainiac Ilya. Made himself a burrow near bunker at Tesla. He's a bit, you know. What am I saying "a bit". He's totally nuts, but knows so much that neither you nor I can even imagine. If you're there, tell him that Fox is getting out, but remembers his promise, and left what he promised in that same place where the gravitrap is. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_610"><text>Gravitrap? Some nonsense. Alright, if I happen to meet him, I'll pass it on.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_new_hello_dialog_701"><text>How are you, friend? Any success?</text></string>

<string id="agro_fox_start_dialog_101"><text>Well, hello. People know me as Fox. Who are you, where from, where to?</text></string>
<string id="agro_fox_start_dialog_102"><text>Hello to you too. I'm Marked One. Sidorovich dubbed me that, I remember almost nothing about myself. Looking for those who know me. You, as I heard, might know something about Strelok, and he seems to be a thread to my past. Will you tell me about him?</text></string>
<string id="agro_fox_start_dialog_103"><text>Marked One, then. Alright.\nI heard about Strelok and his group, can even say I "communicated": once his group fired at my boys. Nobody got hurt - they were clearly waiting for others, so we parted peacefully after that. Cursed each other across the ravine and went separate ways. Actually, that's all.</text></string>
<string id="agro_fox_start_dialog_201"><text>Hello again. How's the head? Remember anything?</text></string>
<string id="agro_fox_start_dialog_202"><text>Hello, hello. No changes so far.</text></string>
<string id="agro_fox_start_dialog_203"><text>I see. Well, sit down and rest, have a drink. You're always running around, fussing.</text></string>

<string id="escape_fox_rygyi_dialog_0"><text>Help? Who?</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_rygyi_dialog_1"><text>Three of us came from Yantar: me, Redhead and Mole. We were carrying some loot, planning to sell to Sidorovich. Already at Agroprom we got ambushed by either bandits or mercenaries - I didn't have time to figure out. While Redhead was running for cover, he flew into "Witch's Jelly" anomaly and got badly injured. Had to drop the loot, of course. Mole started distracting the attackers, and I rushed to Redhead and managed to drag him to a collapsed tunnel, left him there. Me, as you see, immediately ran to Cordon - looking for Doc. Nobody treats "Witch's Jelly" burns better than him. And I almost reached the embankment, but dogs attacked, tore me all up.\nRedhead won't last long... Find Doc, he should be somewhere beyond the embankment, explain the situation. And please - hurry!</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_rygyi_dialog_21"><text>Redhead? Sidorovich said he found me unconscious and carried me to the village on his back, practically saved me from death. Of course I'll help him.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_rygyi_dialog_22"><text>I need to deal with my own problems.</text></string>
<string id="escape_fox_rygyi_dialog_3"><text>Thanks. I'll rest up for a couple days and head to Redhead too. Ah, if only I could get some medkits.</text></string>

<string id="fox_new_start_dialog_101"><text>Marked One, get medicine from Doc.</text></string>
<string id="fox_new_start_dialog_102"><text>Yeah I remember.</text></string>
<string id="fox_new_start_dialog_201"><text>Help Redhead out, Marked One. I'll recover a bit and head there too.</text></string>
<string id="fox_new_start_dialog_301"><text>Greetings, Marked One. Thanks for helping Redhead.</text></string>

<string id="tex_rygyi_help"><text>Fox asked to help Redhead - the stalker who found me at the "death truck" and dragged me to camp. Fox said Redhead was badly hurt by "Witch's Jelly", so need to ask Swamp Doctor to prepare special medicine</text></string>

<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_0"><text>Doc, Fox says Redhead needs some special medicine, he got into "Witch's Jelly" anomaly.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_1"><text>Fox? Where is he? As for Redhead... Yeah... Familiar situation. Those who get into that anomaly, their legs turn to mush, simple remedies won't do...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_2"><text>Fox is in bad shape himself, not far from here, resting in a house on the other side of the railroad. What specifically do you need? I owe Redhead.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_3"><text>Need to prepare special ointment and soak bandages with it. Then carefully bandage legs with these bandages. To make the ointment need extract from bloodsucker flesh, which allows bloodsucker to regenerate so fast. I have tentacle from which this extract can be made, but it oxidizes quickly. For stabilization need mixture of two blind dog tails and two tushkano heads...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_32"><text>Doc, maybe you can make some potion for me too, to help restore memory?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_33"><text>I understand you want to swallow a "miracle pill" and remember everything at once. But I don't know such miracle remedy. I already told you: some external impulse might help.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_4"><text>Yes, you said... But what if there's some remedy... Alright, let's talk about Redhead. So you need two dog tails and two tushkano heads?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_440"><text>Exactly. You'll have to run around a bit, you know that you can't take needed part from every monster.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_441"><text>Yeah I know, already heard. I'll try not to damage the "hide".</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_442"><text>Why not from every one?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_443"><text>Strange thing, but monsters have their weak spots, which are precisely what's valued. Dogs have tails, tushkanos heads, others - other things. These parts suffer the most, either fall off or wear out during lifetime, unclear... Highly radioactive ones also don't have properties that are needed... So not every dog has tail suitable for the job. And you won't get every tushkano with needed head.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_444"><text>I see. I'll try not to damage the "hide".</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_5"><text>Try. I'd go hunting myself, but I'll go check on Fox, can't leave him for long...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_6"><text>If that's all, I'll get everything quickly...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_7"><text>Will also need a bottle of vodka...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi_dialog_8"><text>Well vodka's no problem, wait...</text></string>
<string id="tex_agr_find_rygyi"><text>To prepare medicine Doc additionally needs two blind dog tails, two tushkano heads and bottle of vodka</text></string>

<string id="doctor_rygyi2_dialog_0"><text>Doc, I gathered everything needed for the medicine.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi2_dialog_1"><text>That's good. I'll take care of Fox now, and you walk around for 20 minutes, medicine will be ready, then come back...\nI'll be near Fox, understood?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi2_dialog_2"><text>Good, understood.</text></string>

<string id="doctor_rygyi3_dialog_0"><text>So, Doc, is the medicine ready?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi3_dialog_1"><text>Yes, ready. Here, take it. Don't forget to soak the bandages...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_rygyi3_dialog_2"><text>Got it, going to look for Redhead...</text></string>

<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_101"><text>Marked One, hurry up, Fox is in bad shape...</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_201"><text>So what about the ingredients for Redhead's medicine?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_2011"><text>Haven't collected everything yet...</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_204"><text>Well collect them, why are you running around here? The dogs are over there...</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_20111"><text>Yeah, here, seems I got them already...</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_203"><text>What are you mumbling about?! Speak clearly...</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_301"><text>How are you?..</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_302"><text>Thanks, everything's fine...</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_303"><text>I'm planning to head to my Thicket for now, but don't know when I'll get there... If something urgent comes up, I'll let you know, or we'll meet sooner...</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_304"><text>Thicket? Where's that?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_305"><text>I'd be glad to tell you, but I already told you, I don't want my hints to become instructions for you. Ask around, maybe something will give you an idea. But most likely, I'll find you first myself.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_306"><text>Alright... Good luck.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_401"><text>One minute... What did you want? Marked One, make it quick...</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_501"><text>Marked One... Wait five, ten minutes. And don't go far!</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_dialog_502"><text>Alright, alright...</text></string>

<string id="medkit_r"><text>Healing compound</text></string>
<string id="enc_medkit_r"><text>Swamp Doctor prepared special compound for healing chemical burns. This compound must be applied to bandages and Redhead's legs bandaged with them</text></string>

<string id="doktor_new_start_2dialog_51"><text>So how are things? Everything alright?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_2dialog_101"><text>Marked One, where have you been wandering?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_2dialog_201"><text>So how are things?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_2dialog_202"><text>Everything's fine... Thanks.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_2dialog_203"><text>You look unwell... Rest more. Don't fuss around. Running, running. Running away from yourself...</text></string>

<string id="doktor_new_start_5dialog_101"><text>Hello. How do you feel? Remembered anything?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_5dialog_102"><text>Hello. Seems everything's fine. Head's empty, like a dried up well... What are you looking out for here?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_5dialog_103"><text>I'm waiting for an old friend. He walked the Zone a lot, knows much. The youngsters don't even call him by name - they call him Guide. Promised to come by. So I'm waiting. Got an idea, want to check it...\nWell, you try to get to the Bar, there'll be more experienced stalkers, maybe you'll see someone who will fill your "well"... That's to the north, if you don't remember... Just be more careful, as they say - "measure seven times...".</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_5dialog_104"><text>North? Yeah. Familiar phrase... Alright, I'll try.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_5dialog_105"><text>Good luck on your journey...</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_5dialog_201"><text>Head to the Bar. I think there's no other path for you yet...</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_5dialog_202"><text>Yeah, that's where I'm heading.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_new_start_5dialog_203"><text>Safe travels...</text></string>

<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_1_1"><text>What's it to ya? You see, people... are chattin'. Go your own way.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_1_2"><text>He seems to have yelled something about bandits... or am I imagining things?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_1_3"><text>If ya think so, then go to Father Diodor. He'll sprinkle ya, cross ya, and give ya communion too. In short, man, get outta here, this ain't yer talk... We'll have a quiet chat ourselves here, maybe it'll work itself out. If not - we'll whack the kid, so others learn their lesson.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_1_4"><text>Come on guys, you really gonna shoot him?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_1_5"><text>Yeah, right now! And who's gonna return the debt to Baldy? We'll teach him a lesson now... But first gotta shake down this dummy, maybe he stashed somethin' somewhere.\nAnd why'd ya butt in anyway?! Wanna stand up for him, so buy him out, if you're so kind. Don't wanna take extra sin on ourselves either. And from this sucker you can collect later yourself. We don't give a damn who pays. Long as it's fast.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_1_6"><text>Baldy - who's that?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_1_7"><text>Baldy?! Ya really don't know or playin' dumb? There's this dude in the Bar, local card shark. Sly bastard, no matter how many times I played "Blackjack" with him, always lost. Though I heard recently someone burned him big time, serves the goat right.\nAnd this little bitch lost to Baldy and ran off. Debt ain't big, but ya understand, gotta pay back. So if ya wanna stand up for this sucker, then hand over an artifact, "Jellyfish" or some "Wrenched"... That'll be enough for Baldy, and we'll have some for bread.</text></string>

<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_3_2"><text>First, what thing? And second, what "goat"?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_3_3"><text>Goat's a goat. Bastard ate and drank with us... I dozed off, opened my eyes - no gun! Got used to my little rifle, got attached to it, ya could say... Fang himself gave it to me! Before he went to the center with Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_3_4"><text>Strelok?! I heard about him... Where was this?</text></string>

<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_3_7"><text>He was headin' through Duty checkpoint, the one by the Bar passage, to the valley. Lapot, damn, that's his handle... Asshole.</text></string>

<string id="yurik_start_dialog_51"><text>Walked past when I was asking for help with those lawless bastards, and now you come with talks? Get lost, got enough problems without you.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_52"><text>Well then sit in your pile of... problems.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_101"><text>Thanks, friend, you helped me a lot. They call you Marked One?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_102"><text>For now, temporarily. What happened here?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_103"><text>Got in deep shit. Wanted to try serious business. Got tired of sitting on Cordon, running errands for Wolf. Thought I'd gather some artifacts, shoot some mutants and generally see how things are there... Well, you see how it all turned out. One stalker often visited Sidor, cool guy, always had loot. I begged him to guide me to the Bar through Duty checkpoint. They're grim dudes, don't let just anyone through. And messing with them costs more than it's worth. But with a guide I got through. On the way I thought maybe some loot would come my way.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_104"><text>To the Bar, as I understand, you made it.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_105"><text>Yeah, got there. Bar, I tell ya - that's something! Seasoned stalkers gather there, dump loot after raids, lick wounds, party around the clock. People always got money. Some remember friends, some get wasted with joy, all kinds... many treat others. And there's this Baldy: what's up, youngster, maybe we'll play for small stakes? I was tipsy and tempted, plus on credit... You know the rest.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_106"><text>You're no pretty girl to be tempted. What do people say about north? How is it, beyond the Bar?</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_107"><text>Beyond the Bar? They tell scary stories about monsters, anomalies. Death at every step. Can't get through without good gear. Need suit with gas mask, air's poisoned with something there. And without decent weapons won't manage either. Going in with PM or sawed-off is a dead number. As I see it, no point for a loner to go north at all.</text></string>

<string id="yurik_start_dialog_5021"><text>You could also use some business.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_5022"><text>Yeah, as usual. And I see you've organized a checkpoint here. All the cream of Cordon gathered. A mouse won't slip through.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_5031"><text>If only there was business...</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_5032"><text>You're joking... There will be. Just sick of hanging around the village. Now Fanatic's there instead of Wolf. That one wasn't sweet, but this one's even... better. Completely militarized us, no escape. Either guard duty or work detail, organized maintenance days. Like in the army, with all that follows. Otherwise, we're our own commanders. Sometimes we even raid Garbage if some veteran goes there. Haven't gone past the hangar yet. Don't wanna mess with Duty guys.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_504"><text>Well now... At this rate you'll reach the Bar soon, and then north.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_505"><text>No, Marked One, north isn't for us yet. Need good gear there, weapons, decent medicine, not Sidorovich's iodine and brilliant green. That's tons of artifacts needed, and we don't have them yet. Too early for us to think about north.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_506"><text>Sitting by the fire telling stories won't earn money or find artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_507"><text>Why not. Slowly some loot comes our way. Just after the last Emission got couple artifacts. Traded one for food, ammo and various small stuff, and put the second away, in common fund.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_508"><text>Two artifacts?! Lucky guys. And you're the senior here? After all, you've been to the Bar.</text></string>
<string id="yurik_start_dialog_509"><text>No, we decide everything together. As for the Bar, don't remind me. Won't fall for such persuasion again. Learned my lesson. If not for you...</text></string>

<string id="gar_hellcar_new_start_51"><text>Hello, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_new_start_601"><text>Hello, Marked One. Good to see you...</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_1_dialog_0"><text>What do you know about Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_1_dialog_1"><text>Interested in Strelok?\nLess than a year ago many talked about him... Guys from "Clear Sky" group hunted for him... Searched everywhere...\nHe stirred up some commotion in Zone center. I haven't seen him myself, but knew stalker nicknamed Ghost. According to him, Strelok is a fighter blessed by God.</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_1_dialog_2"><text>Where did you see Ghost? And who might know where Strelok is now?</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_1_dialog_3"><text>Ghost and I did couple runs to Yantar, he wasn't much of a talker...\nBut he communicated a lot with Sakharov, head of science folks at Yantar. So I think Sakharov can tell you more about Ghost.\nPity that "Clear Sky" group broke up... They should have had their intelligence on Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_1_dialog_4"><text>Who are you? How did you get here?</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_1_dialog_5"><text>My name is Demon. I came here three years ago. Like many here - a fugitive. Got two murders and grievous bodily harm hanging over me. Few years ago my friend got badly beaten in foreign district. They put him back together piece by piece in intensive care. Had to pay a courtesy visit. When cops came to arrest me, it so happened that I shot one of them and jumped from third floor. Since then I dwell here. Increased both my score and set of charges considerably. And here I fight lawlessness to the best of my ability. Like on the mainland. Train and organize youngsters, teach them to survive here.</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_1_dialog_6"><text>Probably needed work, what are you planning to do now?</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_1_dialog_7"><text>Bandits got completely brazen, I'll go to Dark Valley, they got something like a lair there.\nI'll observe, maybe some ideas will come up on how to teach this scum a final lesson...</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_1_dialog_8"><text>I see, do you need anything?</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_1_dialog_9"><text>Yeah, in principle, everything needed can be gotten from traders. Though...\nIf you got spare ammo - bring some...</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_2_dialog_0"><text>What kind of place is this?</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_2_dialog_1"><text>Garbage. Place where we belong most. See piles of all kinds of junk? Better not go there, radioactive waste there, Geiger counter sings like nightingale. This is the only convenient passage deep into Zone. And lately bandits started getting active here. Further, where experienced stalkers go, where Duty territory is, they're afraid to stick their noses. But here jackaling, fleecing youngsters, sweet business. So if everyone doesn't care, have to take up arms again.</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_2_dialog_2"><text>You're too "righteous"... Doesn't it strain you?</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_2_dialog_3"><text>This is my life position. Everywhere, especially here, it's necessary to remain human, not cattle whose only goal is thirst for profit.</text></string>

<string id="gar_hellcar_3_dialog_0"><text>What do you know about "Clear Sky"?</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_3_dialog_1"><text>Not much... They sat somewhere in Swamps, these Clear Sky guys. Supposedly studied Zone, tried to find balance between man and this bedlam. Don't understand - either just fools, or up to something... In short, their leader got it in his head that Strelok disrupts this very balance and needs to be killed. So they searched for him.</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_3_dialog_2"><text>Where are they now?</text></string>
<string id="gar_hellcar_3_dialog_3"><text>Seems like they all died, well, maybe not all. But their leaders disappeared somewhere near center approaches. Individual loners from the group still meet from time to time... Their base was in Swamps, where exactly, I - and probably almost nobody - know. Generally, their time passed...</text></string>

<string id="gar_seriy_new_start_2031"><text>What do you mean "where from"? Heard your call for help on radio. Fox told me about you anyway. I'm looking for information about Strelok. Maybe you know something?</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_new_start_2041"><text>Honestly, nothing except stalker tales. But one of my pals might know about Strelok - former digger, Mole. Now he's with his team on run at Yantar. They're planning to return through Agroprom, area not far from here, if you don't know. Road there starts behind railway tunnel, which is visible if you exit this territory through western gates. Just keep in mind that "Bungee" often appears on that road. Don't know how it is now though, haven't been to those parts for long time.\nSo about Mole. As far as I know, quite recently he was planning to rummage in underground under Research Institute looking for your Strelok's stash. I'll send him message and ask to wait for you near eastern complex - stalkers often make camps there. He'll tell you everything on spot himself, and show you if he really managed to dig up something there.</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_new_start_2051"><text>Wow! Thanks for that!</text></string>

<string id="gar_seriy_new_start_20814"><text>Help? Ha! Demon, as I heard, robbed couple gopniks. And they called their buddies. So he got himself in trouble, let him clean up the mess that started because of him. Nothing, he'll manage. In short, if you see him, tell him I'm going to Valley. Got one idea how to punch Borov's thugs in the face. Let him come there too. He knows where.</text></string>

<string id="gar_seriy_new_start_44"><text>Straight road to you, stalker, past anomalies through artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_new_start_441"><text>What interesting can be found at Garbage?</text></string>
<string id="gar_seriy_new_start_4411"><text>Trouble for your ass can be found in any quantities. If you're such pioneer with us, then listen. In east small forest, nothing particularly interesting there, but packs of dogs live there. Be careful. If you follow these rails, they'll lead you to tunnel. Lot of anomalies there, maybe something else interesting, don't know. I didn't particularly rummage there. About Duty checkpoint in north, I think you know.

<string id="kozel_dialog_102"><text>Hello to you too! Don't see any "bandits" here, just one weakling lying around...</text></string>
<string id="kozel_dialog_103"><text>That's me... from surprise. This bastard was hiding behind rebar, and how he fired both barrels - I even heard whistle of shot over my head. Immediately thought there's serious ambush here, they usually never go alone.</text></string>
<string id="kozel_dialog_104"><text>Fear has big eyes, right? Alright, good that he really hid alone here. By the way, they call me Marked One. What about you?</text></string>
<string id="kozel_dialog_105"><text>Call me Phil, Marked One. Or Lapot - by nickname. I owe you for "false alarm". Take some ammo here.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="kozel_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, let's shake hands.</text></string>
<string id="kozel_dialog_202"><text>You know Walnut, Diman?</text></string>
<string id="kozel_dialog_203"><text>That gloomy one who walks in coat? Had drinks with him few days ago... Why do you need him?</text></string>
<string id="kozel_dialog_204"><text>I don't need him, I need unique rifle you took from him.</text></string>
<string id="kozel_dialog_205"><text>He told you that? What an ass. He shoved it on me himself when drunk, as sign of friendship, he said.</text></string>
<string id="kozel_dialog_206"><text>Listen, I don't give a damn what you had between yourselves. Give me the gun and we'll part ways.</text></string>
<string id="kozel_dialog_207"><text>Don't have that gun! I traded it yesterday for couple artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="kozel_dialog_208"><text>Who did you trade with? Where to look for it?</text></string>
<string id="kozel_dialog_209"><text>Some stalker, didn't ask his name. He was walking from Bar direction with full backpack of artifacts. Said he's going to Sidor, to Cordon. He's got distinctive suit. He left quite recently, if you hurry, you'll catch up.</text></string>
<string id="kozel_dialog_210"><text>To Cordon then. Alright, I'll hurry.</text></string>
<string id="kozel_dialog_301"><text>Good luck finding the rifle!</text></string>
<!-- Прапор -->
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_101"><text>Stop, stalker. You can't go further!</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_102"><text>Why?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_103"><text>Further is our territory. Bar is base of "Duty" faction. And we're very picky choosing who we let into our home. If you don't have particularly important business with our leadership, we won't let you through.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_104"><text>So this is path to Bar? But I need to get to Bar, experienced stalkers go there, maybe someone will recognize me...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_105"><text>I'd let you through, but... who knows who you are... Prove you can be trusted.\nWhat's your name?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_106"><text>If I only knew! Sidorovich dubbed me Marked One, so I walk around like that now...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_107"><text>Alright, Marked One... So you know Sidor...\nHe promised to get us flamethrower for one good artifact.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_108"><text>What the hell do you need flamethrower for?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_109"><text>Small creatures bred like hell... Rats, tushkanos come in packs, can't stock enough ammo for them... And with flamethrower you can cover whole pack. So, will you work as courier?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_1091"><text>Dark Valley? That's...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_1092"><text>What, you fell off a truck? Everyone knows where Dark Valley is. It's right there behind hill from here. There's road to valley, all sorts of things sometimes come from there. So, will you work as courier?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_110"><text>Alright, give me your artifact, I'll go...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_111"><text>Not so fast, guy. One of ours, Leshy, already carried container with artifact to Cordon and vanished like through earth. Maybe some nonsense happened to him, backpack tore or twisted ankle, or maybe something more serious... Try to find him. I think he tried to cross embankment somewhere in east, near old tunnel. There, of course, area is contaminated with radiation, but away from extra eyes and no need to share with soldiers again.\nFind out what happened to our comrade and bring flamethrower - welcome to Bar.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_1121"><text>So plow through all of Cordon? Alright, I'll try.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_1122"><text>Another time...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_201"><text>So how is it, Marked One. Where's our flamethrower?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_251"><text>It's you, Marked One. Ready for business?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_301"><text>Stop, stalker. You can't go further!</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_302"><text>Why can't I?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_303"><text>Further is our territory base of "Duty" faction. And we're very picky choosing who we let into our home. If you don't have particularly important business with our leadership, we won't let you through.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_304"><text>Sidorovich told me he made arrangements and I'd be let through...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_305"><text>Sidorovich... That ferret... I can let you through, but little use to you, after last emission road to Bar is almost impassable, you'll just lose your head for nothing.\nWhat's your name?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_306"><text>If I only knew! Sidorovich dubbed me Marked One, so I walk around like that now...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_307"><text>Alright, Marked One... So you know Sidor...\nHe promised to get us flamethrower for one good artifact.</text></string>

<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_3102"><text>No, I'll try to get to Bar...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_311"><text>Not so fast, guy. One of ours, Leshy, already carried this artifact, but vanished somewhere on Cordon. Where exactly, don't know... Try to find him, if we get flamethrower, then welcome to Bar.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_3121"><text>So plow through all of Cordon? Alright, I'll try...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_3122"><text>Another time...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_320"><text>Decide yourself, I'm not your mother, change your mind - come by, we'll talk...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_321"><text>Alright, off I go...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_401"><text>Marked One. Barman contacted, says you can be let through, but...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_402"><text>What but?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_403"><text>After last emission road to Bar is practically impassable, anomaly upon anomaly... My advice: wait for now.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_404"><text>I'll try to get through, got business in Bar.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_501"><text>Hi, Marked One, how's health?..</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_601"><text>Marked One, can you fulfill one request?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_602"><text>What request?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_603"><text>We lost several people in Dark Valley. Try to find out what happened to them. There's information they might have been captured by thugs - by bandits. Check bandit base if possible.\nIf you don't know yet, not far from here starts short path that leads to Valley. Sending you coordinates.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_604"><text>What if they're there?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_605"><text>Just report to us, we'll try to get them out.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_606"><text>Good, if opportunity arises, I'll find out what happened to your people.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_951"><text>It's you! Always running around... When will you calm down...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_502"><text>Thanks. Can't complain...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_503"><text>I envy you, wish I could...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_801"><text>It's you... So, returning flamethrower?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_8021"><text>Yes, don't need it anymore. Take it.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_8022"><text>Wait, still need it.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_8031"><text>Yeah, everything's fine. Well, go through. If anything - contact me.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_8032"><text>Come on, don't drag it out.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_new_981"><text>It's you! Always running around... When will you calm down...</text></string>

<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_0"><text>About Dark Valley...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_1"><text>Been waiting for news... Did you manage to find out anything?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_11"><text>Yeah. Met one of yours there, called Bullet. Together we rescued his partner from bandits - Max Luber.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_12"><text>Yeah. Met one of yours there, called Bullet. He died unfortunately, when we tried to rescue his partner, Max Luber, from bandits together</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_13"><text>Yeah. Met one of yours there, called Bullet. Together we tried to rescue his partner, Max Luber, from bandits. Didn't work out unfortunately. Max died.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_14"><text>Yeah. Met one of yours there, called Bullet. Tried to rescue his partner, Max Luber, from bandits together. Unfortunately, both ended up dying in shootout.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_15"><text>Well, so... Met one of yours there, called Bullet. He wanted me to help him rescue partner from bandits. But in the end situation resolved without my participation.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_111"><text>Yes, I already know about this pair. Thanks for standing up for the guy. Anything else?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_121"><text>Yes, I already know about this. Damn... Bullet was one of our best fighters. Good that at least his partner was rescued. Anything else?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_131"><text>Yes, I already know about this. Damn... Luber was excellent fighter. Pity we couldn't rescue the guy. Anything else?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_141"><text>What? Both died? Can't believe it... Damn... This pair was among our best fighters. Very sorry. Anything else to report?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_151"><text>Yes, I already know about this. Anything else to report?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_21"><text>Saw another one of yours at bandit base, they keep him in basement, under lock of course. Someone called Shaggy.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_22"><text>No, nothing else.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_31"><text>So Sergei's alive? Good news, we'll try to pull him out. This is for you, thanks for help!</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_32"><text>Alright, in any case, thanks for responding to my request. Take some ammo here.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dolgers_dialog_4"><text>Wasn't difficult for me. Good luck!</text></string>

<string id="tex_gar_flame_0"><text>Prapor's messenger - Leshy - disappeared on Cordon. Need to find him and learn why flamethrower wasn't delivered to Garbage checkpoint</text></string>
<string id="tex_gar_flame_1"><text>Leshy died. Found hastily written note on him: "Dogs attacked with tushkanos, barely escaped! Had to drop container. Remembered place: before reaching pig farm, to right of road, near distinctive stump".\nNeed to find container!</text></string>
<string id="tex_gar_flame_2"><text>Need to exchange found container for flamethrower from Sidorovich and bring this unique weapon to Prapor</text></string>

<string id="gar_flame_1_dialog_0"><text>Listen, tell me again what needs to be brought to Sidor...</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_1_dialog_1"><text>Your memory... Sidorovich promised us flamethrower for rare artifact.\nThis artifact in protective container was carried by one of our guys - Leshy, but disappeared on Cordon. If you find Leshy and container with him, trade for flamethrower and bring it here. Don't doubt gratitude, won't shortchange you.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_1_dialog_2"><text>Yes, remembered, good...</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_1_dialog_3"><text>Sorry, maybe later somehow.</text></string>

<string id="gar_flame_2_dialog_0"><text>Yeah, I wanted to say about flamethrower...</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_2_dialog_1"><text>Brought it? Awesome! Give it here quick. And what about Leshy, did you find out where he disappeared?</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_2_dialog_2"><text>Why so excited? Here, take your toy. As for Leshy... he's dead. Looks like dogs tore him apart when he tried to cross embankment.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_2_dialog_23"><text>Damn, you blockhead. I left it here, nearby, was heavy to carry. I'll bring it soon, wait.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_2_dialog_24"><text>Not so fast. I couldn't find your Leshy yet, but I'm still on it. Just wanted to warn that there's delay with your task...</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_2_dialog_25"><text>Found Leshy, he's dead. Looks like dogs tore him apart when he tried to cross embankment. Such things.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_2_dialog_31"><text>Damn! Pity for the guy. But thanks to you, his death won't be in vain! Now we'll reliably cover this road! Here's good artifact for help - you'll run with it like deer. Just need tons of food.\nBy the way, road to Bar became bit freer, so you can move.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_2_dialog_32"><text>Damn! Pity for the guy. But thanks to you, his death won't be in vain! Now we'll reliably cover this road! Hmm... wait... Sidor and I agreed flamethrower would be fully charged. Well, alright, this is solvable. Here's good artifact for help - you'll run with it like deer. Just need tons of food.\nBy the way, road to Bar became bit freer, so you can move.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_2_dialog_35"><text>Damn! Pity for the guy. What about container with artifact? Was container with him? It needs to be delivered to Sidorovich, and from him to us - flamethrower. Finish what Leshy started, let his death not be in vain.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_2_dialog_45"><text>Container... yes, I'm working on that.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_2_dialog_4"><text>Yeah? Well then I'll dash to Barman.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_2_dialog_5"><text>Come by sometime, we'll sit, drink glass of tea...</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_2_dialog_6"><text>When there's time - definitely!</text></string>

<string id="gar_flame_3_dialog_0"><text>I'm here on business, brought container with artifact.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_3_dialog_1"><text>What artifact?</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_3_dialog_2"><text>Duty checkpoint commander sent it, for flamethrower.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_3_dialog_3"><text>Ah, Prapor? Yes, I promised him, but he said Leshy would come?</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_3_dialog_4"><text>Leshy died, didn't quite reach you... Apparently dogs got him.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_3_dialog_5"><text>Pity, he was skilled stalker. Well alright, give me container, take flamethrower. Say hello to Prapor, here's present for you...</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_3_dialog_6"><text>Thanks, I'm off.</text></string>

<string id="gar_flame_4_dialog_0"><text>How's health? I want to borrow flamethrower for a while.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_4_dialog_1"><text>Mmm, thanks, slowly. Where are you going that you want to drag such contraption with you?</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_4_dialog_2"><text>There's underground here, poltergeists there - tons! Without flamethrower it'll be tough... And I need to go there on business that concerns everyone.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_4_dialog_3"><text>Well... You understand, I would help of course, but our flamethrower's charge is already at zero, and there are no spare tanks with mixture. Unless you turn to Sidor, he can get anything. Let's agree like this: I give flamethrower for free, but you return it fully charged. And until you return it - no passage to Bar for you! Deal?</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_4_dialog_41"><text>Deal.</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_4_dialog_5"><text>Take it. Hope you keep your word!</text></string>
<string id="gar_flame_4_dialog_42"><text>Won't let me? Well, I'll try to manage without flamethrower.</text></string>

<string id="hellcar_help_blokpost_dialog_0"><text>Not far from here bandits want to chop up stalkers...</text></string>
<string id="hellcar_help_blokpost_dialog_1"><text>Hmm, so what? Stalker, bandit or someone else - what difference? Main thing they don't stick their noses where they shouldn't...</text></string>
<string id="hellcar_help_blokpost_dialog_21"><text>Decide yourself, this Demon isn't relative to me anyway...</text></string>
<string id="hellcar_help_blokpost_dialog_22"><text>There are few of them - stalkers. Maybe you'll help after all?</text></string>
<string id="hellcar_help_blokpost_dialog_23"><text>Bandits will lay them out, then yours won't feel well either.</text></string>
<string id="hellcar_help_blokpost_dialog_24"><text>Demon says these bros will start wasting yours too.</text></string>
<string id="hellcar_help_blokpost_dialog_31"><text>You think correctly! This Demon, between us, is quite a type. Circulated here among ours wanted poster - to keep eye on him. Very often he sticks his nose in all kinds of fights for no reason. Either too "idealistic", or covering tracks... You'd better avoid such types, after whom only corpses remain, by tenth road. You'll stay healthier...</text></string>
<string id="hellcar_help_blokpost_dialog_32"><text>Few? Well let them get out of there. What is this - "Your motherland behind you, Moscow behind"? What habit of fools - climbing into trouble!</text></string>
<string id="hellcar_help_blokpost_dialog_33"><text>So?! Waste ours - waster will be wasted. "DUTY" is not bunch of ragamuffins who are looking for ways to pull some nasty thing out of Zone! What's here should be here and destroyed! On this principle "Duty" stands and will stand! And the more all kinds of idiots shoot each other, the cleaner earth will be...</text></string>
<string id="hellcar_help_blokpost_dialog_34"><text>Which Demon? The one who makes trouble himself? As I heard, several stalker groups with good loot disappeared. And for some reason Demon's name often came up in conversations... Maybe just coincidence. Or maybe...\nIn short - "Duty" won't spill blood for those who don't prove themselves as our people in spirit!</text></string>

<string id="hellcar_help_oreh_dialog_0"><text>Listen, Walnut, wanna shoot?</text></string>
<string id="hellcar_help_oreh_dialog_1"><text>What? What ya talkin' about? I'm, damn, already armed...</text></string>
<string id="hellcar_help_oreh_dialog_2"><text>Demon with buddies want to beat up someone. Maybe you'll help with yours? Demon will pay in thanks...</text></string>
<string id="hellcar_help_oreh_dialog_3"><text>You're somethin', bro! Signed up for that Demon! That's complete thug! Guys like him are only good in grave... They whack him - that's where he belongs! And advice for ya - spit on that bastard, he'll fool ya like sucker and won't ask yer name.</text></string>
<string id="hellcar_help_oreh_dialog_4"><text>Man, you're really goin'... Alright, calm down.</text></string>

<string id="agr_defector_dialog_11"><text>Quick, there's trouble at factory complex! Our group stood up for some loner, we caught his SOS signal...</text></string>
<string id="agr_defector_dialog_12"><text>More specific? Explain properly.</text></string>
<string id="agr_defector_dialog_13"><text>No time! Let's run there!</text></string>
<string id="agr_defector_dialog_14"><text>No, I'm not getting into others' fights without understanding like this.</text></string>
<string id="agr_defector_dialog_15"><text>Alright, let's go.</text></string>
<string id="agr_defector_dialog_21"><text>No time for chatter, need to hurry to help ours!</text></string>
<string id="agr_defector_dialog_22"><text>I'm running, running...</text></string>
<string id="agr_defector_dialog_23"><text>If needed - then hurry.</text></string>
<string id="agr_defector_dialog_31"><text>Thanks for help, friend!</text></string>
<string id="agr_defector_dialog_32"><text>Come on, what's the big deal...</text></string>

<string id="agr_klyk_101"><text>What?! Who is it? Doc, is that you?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_201"><text>Who? I'll shoot!</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_202"><text>Easy, Fang! It's me, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_203"><text>Marked One... Good to hear you.</text></string>

<string id="agr_klyk_01_0"><text>This isn't Doc...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_01_1"><text>Only Doc and Strelok's team knew the way here, who are you?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_01_2"><text>I don't remember who I am... Call me Marked One...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_01_3"><text>Marked One? Your voice reminds me of someone... Come closer.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_01_4"><text>I'm already right next to you, gone blind or what?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_01_5"><text>Yes, blind. I can barely see anything, just some gray spots...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_01_6"><text>How did this happen to you? Who are you? What do you know about Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_01_7"><text>So many questions... They call me Fang. Or used to call me that. There were three of us - crazy artifact hunters: Strelok, Ghost and me. In past life. We went deep into Zone, hunted most unusual and valuable artifacts... I didn't go on runs often - solved all kinds of technical issues, and those two tried to break through all the way to the center! Yeah... Strelok was senior among us, not for nothing they called him that - he was fighter blessed by God! With him I wouldn't have perished...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_01_8"><text>What happened to him?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_01_9"><text>I don't know! Doc kept asking too... I went to Dark Valley on Strelok's errand, and controller got me on way back. I only remember - my head started buzzing and... everything... Doc found me couple months ago, dragged me here. I don't remember this myself, he told me later when my head cleared up a bit. Said he wanted to take me to thicket first, burrow there is more reliable and I'd be under supervision, but I was getting worse before his eyes, so had to decide something urgently. That's why he dragged me here, and barely made it in time... That's what he said anyway.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_01_10"><text>So why are you sitting here? You need to get out of Zone, to real doctors.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_01_11"><text>I can't... On surface my head immediately tears apart... Some kind of radiation there, very sensitive for zombie brains. So I sit here, Doc drops by from time to time, brings food. Says I'm here temporarily. There is... should be possibility to shield from radiation and go to surface or at least to another place closer to him somewhere. So I hope, otherwise would've put bullet in forehead long ago.</text></string>

<string id="agr_klyk_02_0"><text>How can I help you?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_02_1"><text>I don't know. But if anyone can help, it's probably Sakharov.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_02_2"><text>Sakharov? He's one of the scientists?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_02_3"><text>Well yes. Professor Sakharov, he's head of scientific expedition. Been living here almost since Zone's emergence. At Yantar in bunker they have base. He should know everything about zombies, there are tons of them, I mean us - zombies, there...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_02_4"><text>I'll definitely find out! And even if he doesn't know, I'll still try to find way to help you.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_02_5"><text>Thanks, I'll hope...</text></string>

<string id="agr_klyk_03_0"><text>What is this place? I feel like I know it.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_03_1"><text>That's unlikely... Our group had secret stash here. Over there on left lies Strelok's famous Kalash. With this rifle one of pioneer stalkers got into anomaly, stalker got torn to pieces, but rifle mysteriously became more rapid-firing and accurate!\nThis is reliable place! Nobody could get here! And you can exit very easily and unnoticed.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_03_2"><text>How so?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_03_3"><text>There's some tricky spatial anomaly here. Responds to artifacts. If you stand near that door and activate certain artifact on belt, it'll teleport you to exit hatch on surface... in theory. Or somewhere else. Doc told me something like that and even named specific artifacts, but I don't remember...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_03_31"><text>Spatial anomaly? Doc probably uses it to get in.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_03_32"><text>Well, probably. Though I can't see, I hear - he appears out of nowhere. He's not there, not there, and suddenly there.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_03_33"><text>Why doesn't he take you out through same anomaly?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_03_34"><text>He said many times already that it's possible to teleport to cave in Misty Thicket. But says brain won't withstand it. Teleports also pressure somehow, though not constantly, but strongly sometimes. So he can't yet. Or waiting for some opportunity.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_03_4"><text>I see... I'd advise mining the stairs - set up tripwire or something. I got here, so it's not such reliable place.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_03_5"><text>You're probably right, I'll do that.</text></string>

<string id="agr_klyk_04_0"><text>Tell me about Strelok. I feel - he's key to my memory.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_04_1"><text>Strelok... He was unusual, not of this world. Appeared couple years ago. Ghost and I were sitting in Swamps after particularly big emission. Sitting there, drinking vodka, counting if gathered loot is enough to replenish supplies... Then he bursts through door, completely naked, eyes insane... I thought another zombie got brought in. And he goes: "Let's drink!"... Ha! Speaks Russian strangely, can't tell where from right away. Yeah...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_04_2"><text>What did he want and why was he naked in swamp?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_04_3"><text>Said he teleported, but didn't say from where. But clearly from far away. Asked what year it was... And who can show road to Monolith.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_04_4"><text>Where did he go most often? Who might know where he is now?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_04_5"><text>Most often? Most often he was closer to Zone center, kept looking for path to Monolith. Sometimes dropped loot at Bar, explored Radar. Looked for unusual teleports, had instinct for them - seeker, basically... If you found Ghost - he communicated a lot with Strelok. And me - I was just fetch and carry.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_04_6"><text>You say three of you went deep into Zone, tried to break through to center... How? There's no direct road there it seems.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_04_7"><text>No. We didn't go to very center, I definitely didn't... I'm saying, we went deep into Zone. But you're right - there's no direct road there. It was Strelok who kept striving for center, had his own ideas. Maybe Ghost went with him... Hard for me to concentrate and remember exactly now... I found flash drive here. Strelok dropped it or someone else, don't know. If you find computer, try to open it. Maybe something will become clear.</text></string>

<string id="agr_klyk_05_0"><text>I met with Sakharov. He says he can help you.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_1"><text>He can?! I already didn't believe. How?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_21"><text>Sakharov tuned special helmet. Says it will screen radiation.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_22"><text>Sakharov gave special helmet. Says it will screen radiation... where did I put it... Wait, dropped it apparently.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_31"><text>So what's next?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_32"><text>Yeah, maybe it's for the better. I don't believe in all this...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_41"><text>Honestly, I somehow doubt this is good idea... You see, professor wants to take you under his wing. Like for treatment. Though he claimed they're not into these things at all. And then supposedly they might even transfer you to real specialists on mainland, but... all this sounded somehow unconvincing.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_42"><text>No, wait, I'll dash out now, find it and come back...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_5"><text>Aren't you being too dramatic, Marked One? Judge for yourself: what other options do I have? Better to have bad chances than none at all, right?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_6"><text>Listen, Fang, can you wait a bit more? I'm afraid they'll send you as test rat to some closed research institute and that's it...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_7"><text>What if they can really help me there? And what else to wait for? It definitely won't get better for me here.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_81"><text>I understand... But please, be patient little more. I think there should be other ways to help you.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_82"><text>Ah, screw it, you're right! At least there's some hope. Here's helmet. Put it on head and go out.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_9"><text>Wait, what will I do next, how will I get to Sakharov? Well, suppose I put on this helmet, suppose it even helps... But I can barely see anything. What if helmet breaks, or something else...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_10"><text>Sakharov said helicopter will come for you and deliver straight to camp at Yantar. Probably they can somehow detect this contraption's operation and will navigate by signal. I'd escort you, but they warned me aircraft will be military and they might react nervously to extra "passenger"... Come on, go upstairs, since you decided! No point wasting time.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_11"><text>Alright. Hope we'll see each other again. You still remind me of someone. Voice, manner of speech, intonations. Would like to look at you with eyes... Take care.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_12"><text>Wait! Wanted to ask one more thing. What do you know about Monolith?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_13"><text>About Monolith? There was such legend, supposedly it's special artifact that grants wishes. Seems Strelok was convinced it's not legend at all and looked for ways to reach it. But I don't know anything proper about this. Supposedly Strelok and Ghost met with some scientist, discussed this question, but what came of it - I'm not aware.\nYes, here's what else I remembered: shortly before I got screwed, Strelok asked to think how to break code locks of bunker doors that sometimes appear in Zone. I didn't really get into it then - no time, and he was rushing somewhere. Also asked to find decent computer. Said we'll figure it out, think together how to make decoder. Also mentioned some labs. Seems he wanted to rush through them quickly to north, maybe right to that Monolith...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_14"><text>I don't understand, how is this possible? What labs?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_15"><text>I didn't understand him then either. Strelok and Ghost were always abnormal, came unexpectedly, unexpectedly rushed off on another raid. Well there. Once from another run Strelok burst in on me with words "This is our chance!". He found something, apparently. Ghost later kept cursing that they barely got away from mercenaries that day. And questioned me, did Strelok give anything, and if he did, what exactly... I said: he didn't give anything useful, just instructions. So I don't know what labs he meant...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_16"><text>What happened then?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_171"><text>Nothing. I went to Valley on his errand, and got caught on way back... Find Ghost or that scientist they met with, you'll learn more. Just can't remember name of that scientist.\nYes! I kept one artifact for myself here, thought if I have to get out after all, it'll help at least scare off dogs. And now - what do I need it for?! Let it better serve good person. Well, be healthy, friend!</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_172"><text>Nothing. I went to Valley on his errand, and got caught on way back... Find Ghost or that scientist they met with, you'll learn more. Just can't remember name of that scientist.\nYes! That "Compass" Doc left me - what do I need it for now?! Take it. Let it better serve good person. Well, be healthy, friend!</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_05_18"><text>Same to you. Farewell.</text></string>

<string id="agr_klyk_seif_dlg_0"><text>Fang, can I leave some loot here with you? Will you watch it?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_seif_dlg_1"><text>No problem. Just you know... Feel sick at heart, need to forget even briefly. Let's do this: bottle from you - and you can dump your stuff in that box. Everything will be safe and sound until you return, promise.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_seif_dlg_21"><text>Deal. Take bottle. Maybe pour you some right away or cut some snacks?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_seif_dlg_22"><text>Don't have vodka with me, sorry. Another time.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_seif_dlg_3"><text>Marked One, though I can't see, my hands haven't withered yet. I'll manage myself.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_seif_dlg_4"><text>Alright. As you say.</text></string>

<string id="tex_agr_klyk_0"><text>Fang has severely damaged brain. Probably only Sakharov has necessary qualification to help deal with this damage. Need to reach Sakharov and outline situation</text></string>
<string id="tex_agr_klyk_2"><text>Need to convince Fang to put on helmet, go to surface and wait for helicopter that will deliver Fang to Sakharov. Or not convince?</text></string>

<string id="tex_gar_stalker_info"><text>I remember him! Seems we drank together and he told that Borov had excellent mechanic. This mechanic usually converted ordinary MP5s for PM cartridge. Borov seems to be boss among bros. Need to ask - such gun would be useful</text></string>

<string id="borov_01_dialog_0"><text>One of yours said here: can shoot the breeze with ya...</text></string>
<string id="borov_01_dialog_1"><text>What the f... Who the hell are ya?!</text></string>
<string id="borov_01_dialog_2"><text>Helped one of yours here - Mongol's his handle...</text></string>
<string id="borov_01_dialog_3"><text>Saved Mongol, eh... Waste of time. Shit person - garbage, not a man...\nWell alright. I keep locals in my fist, like boss for them. Since you helped one, means you got respect from whole crew. If I said so, not one dog from our gang will touch you.\nWhat's your name?</text></string>
<string id="borov_01_dialog_4"><text>I'm Marked One. Call me that...</text></string>
<string id="borov_01_dialog_5"><text>Marked One? Marked by whom? Alright, that's humor joke...</text></string>
<string id="borov_011_dialog_0"><text>One person directed me...</text></string>
<string id="borov_011_dialog_1"><text>What the f... Who the hell are ya?!</text></string>
<string id="borov_011_dialog_2"><text>Tooth. Heard of such?</text></string>
<string id="borov_011_dialog_3"><text>Ah, Toothy... Yes, they passed me his request, while there's no trouble from you, we'll chat nicely.\nWell alright. I keep locals in my fist, like boss for them. If I said so, not one dog from our gang will touch you.\nWhat's your name?</text></string>
<string id="borov_011_dialog_4"><text>I'm Marked One. Call me that...</text></string>
<string id="borov_011_dialog_5"><text>Marked One? Marked by whom? Alright, that's humor joke...</text></string>
<string id="borov_012_dialog_0"><text>Got business to talk, and it was arranged...</text></string>
<string id="borov_012_dialog_1"><text>What the f... Who the hell are ya?!</text></string>
<string id="borov_012_dialog_2"><text>Tooth. Heard of such? And Mongol swore he'd pass thanks to you...</text></string>
<string id="borov_012_dialog_3"><text>Saved Mongol, eh... And Toothy spoke up for you. Real hero...\nWell alright. I keep locals in my fist, like boss for them. Since you helped one, means you got respect from whole crew. If I said so, not one dog from our gang will touch you.\nWhat's your name?</text></string>
<string id="borov_012_dialog_4"><text>I'm Marked One. Call me that...</text></string>
<string id="borov_012_dialog_5"><text>Marked One? Marked by whom? Alright, that's humor joke...</text></string>

<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_0"><text>I heard you had skilled mechanic with weapons?</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_1"><text>Had one, got poisoned couple months ago... Got drunk on bad vodka, beast. Fell asleep and didn't wake up. Idiot, what else to say about him.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_2"><text>Pity. Thought to trade HK MP5 submachine gun for PM cartridge from him, well never mind.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_3"><text>Hmm, actually, couple such guns remained... Due to ammo shortage many would like to get such weapon.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_4"><text>And? As I understand, can't just buy or trade this tech wonder?</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_5"><text>You understand correctly. Got one job, small one. Need to verify someone's death...</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_6"><text>I don't kill for hire! Find another hitman!</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_7"><text>Notice, I said - verify, not kill. Thing is, one of our old accomplices got in hopeless situation. Hopeless in direct sense. Went for artifact through anomalies, grabbed radiation and couldn't get out. Died there.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_8"><text>So what? Lots of people kick the bucket.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_9"><text>Yeah, you're right. In general case. But not this one. As I said, this is old accomplice, he's been with us long time, knew many things and many people.\nAnd I'm tormented by vague doubts: did he really croak or maybe decided to sell us all out, to Duty or soldiers. Agree, very convenient - you're dead and nobody bears grudge against you. Too easily he - if it's him - got caught, doesn't seem like experienced convict.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_10"><text>What do you want from me?</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_11"><text>Very simple job. You examine corpse, find certain characteristic details, report about it. Result: you get decent gun, and I sleep peacefully.\nSo, fair?</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_121"><text>Seems fair. Where to go and what "characteristic details" to find?</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_122"><text>Sounds simple. But have you crawled in anomalies yourself? Try it.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_132"><text>As you wish. My job is to offer. I'll find another willing one.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_start_dialog_131"><text>I thought so, can see right away you're seasoned guy, Marked One! Now to business:\nAccomplice, what's his name - you don't need to know, contacted from Garbage territory. Corpse supposedly his, my boys saw behind tech cemetery - in small grove. Get closer - balls failed, anomalies there everywhere. If you get through, check. This dude never parted with mouth harp, thought it saves him from all troubles. If you find this harp on stiff, means it's him. If not, means we need to tear claws from here and change all stashes.</text></string>

<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_0"><text>Listen, Borov, I'm about your task, regarding accomplice...</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_1"><text>What about the task?</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_21"><text>Changed my mind, won't go into anomalies.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_31"><text>Balls failed? Alright, your business.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_22"><text>Repeat again, where to look for corpse?</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_32"><text>Yeah, Marked One, and I thought you were man with brains. Alright once more:\nAccomplice contacted from Garbage territory. Corpse supposedly his, my boys saw behind tech cemetery - in small grove. Check if corpse has mouth harp.\nThat's all!</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_321"><text>Alright, alright, can't even ask...</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_23"><text>Found your stiff, almost croaked in anomalies myself.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_3"><text>Don't inflate price, not at market. Is it him or not? Was harp with him?</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_41"><text>It's him! Here's harp - took from corpse.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_42"><text>How should I know - him or not? We didn't drink to brotherhood. But no harp on corpse.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_511"><text>Phew, damn! Thank balls! Thanks, you calmed me... I gave away all homemade guns I promised to bros, sorry. Here, take better machine instead! Plus for peace of mind small present - ammo.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_512"><text>Phew, damn! Thank balls! Thanks, you calmed me... Stop! What's this crap? Why is cover scratched? You went inside? Tell me, you removed casing, right?</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_52"><text>Damn... As I sensed, some trap here! Have to fold business with... well, that's not your concern. What did I promise you for work? Ah! That homemade gun. Well, here it is.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_6"><text>Alright, friendly like.</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_61"><text>I didn't remove anything. Everything was already like that. Found another Hendrix too. On accordion I could still play something, but this instrument - don't even know which side to blow into. Why you so worked up?</text></string>
<string id="borov_harmonica_done_dialog_71"><text>Too smart? I'll check what's inside now, then call bros, laugh together... Hmm... yeah it's in place... You, Marked One, this... forget what I babbled here now, mixed up some things bit. Here, take gun I promised. Step now, need to think.</text></string>
<string id="tex_borov_harmonica_article"><text>Borov suspects his old accomplice faked death. To make sure, need to search corpse located in small grove behind tech cemetery at Garbage. Can get HK MP5 9x18 submachine gun as reward</text></string>

<string id="harmonica_b"><text>Mouth harp</text></string>
<string id="enc_harmonica_b"><text>This mouth harp belonged to bandit who died at Garbage. Under protective casing you can find scrap of thin cigarette paper with several rows of numbers - probably cipher. One word can be read - "Raven"</text></string>

<string id="voron_hello_dialog_101"><text>Hello, friend. What's your name?</text></string>
<string id="voron_hello_dialog_102"><text>Hello to you too. They call me Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="voron_hello_dialog_103"><text>Pleased to meet you! I'm Raven, Vitek Raven. Can help get some rare gear, also share useful information or connect with right people. Not for free, of course.</text></string>
<string id="voron_hello_dialog_104"><text>Yeah? What do you want in return?</text></string>
<string id="voron_hello_dialog_105"><text>I have connections to collectors of all kinds of unusual things. Sums, of course, not big, but stable income and most importantly, there's possibility to get necessary equipment for those trying to survive in Zone. Monster parts, artifacts, unusual devices, unique stalker trinkets - circle of interests of real collectors is wide. So if you need something, contact me. As they say: you scratch my back - I scratch yours.</text></string>
<string id="voron_hello_dialog_106"><text>I see. Think I'll definitely contact you.</text></string>
<string id="voron_hello_dialog_201"><text>Marked One! What brings you to us?</text></string>

<string id="voron_artist_start_0"><text>You talked about various collectors there. Maybe there's some order? I'd take it on.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_1"><text>You're so eager! We barely know each other, and you already want personal order. I'd like to test you first in some simple matter.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_2"><text>No problem. What matter?</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_31"><text>Right now I have nothing suitable to entrust you. Come by in day or two or maybe in week.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_32"><text>So listen carefully. There's one artist in Zone, I mean real one, by profession. Everyone called him simply Artist. Harmless person, gets along with everyone, been many places, speaks bit strangely, but his stories are very interesting and instructive to listen to. Sort of collector of local folklore. And even more interesting - to flip through his album with notes and sketches about Zone. He showed it to many, but always refused to sell or trade, though they promised him quite a lot. This guy used to visit here often, but haven't heard about him for long time. And few days ago I heard rumor that supposedly he was seen at old regional committee dacha, in Swamps, but... then mysticism starts.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_41"><text>I understand. See you.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_42"><text>Mysticism right away? Zone is full of various wonders that science doesn't even know how to approach.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_5"><text>What does science have to do with it?! According to stalker who saw Artist, it was like this: he was walking one evening past regional committee dacha, darkness, pouring rain. Suddenly through water noise he hears someone calling him by name. Voice immediately seemed familiar. Listened - sound comes from house attic. Guy's not timid, decided to get closer. Just then lightning flashed bright and in that light he saw motionless figure standing in attic window... It was that same Artist, could hardly mistake, they met many times. Only now Artist looked exactly like dead man, but his lips were moving, repeating stalker's name over and over. That one, no matter how brave, still - ran from there without looking back. Almost flew into nearest anomaly...</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_6"><text>What a story. Really creepy. What do you want from me? Look for holy water? There's one church in Swamps...</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_7"><text>I share your skepticism. Dark, rain like from bucket, anomalies humming around, various creatures prowling nearby... who knows what might seem. Anyway, I want you to go check that place. If there's really some dead man there, search him. Artist never parted with his album. Find album, means that stalker didn't imagine it, means it's Artist. If there's no album with him or no corpse at all... well, at least there'll be hope that guy's still alive.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_8"><text>Something tells me Artist's fate worries you much less than appeared possibility to get his album.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_9"><text>Just don't start song about moral side, okay? You're not taking this job on altruistic basis yourself, but want some profit. Well, so do I. Business is business.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_10"><text>By the way, about profit. You haven't voiced yet what it'll be for me. Testing me in work - understandable. But not for free!</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_11"><text>Don't pay much during probation, you understand. Offer such terms: if you bring album, I give excellent second level artifact, or tip about decent stash, with guarantee. Choose later what suits you more. Well, if album's not found, then bit of medicine and that's all. I don't get anything either in this case. Fair?</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_121"><text>No, won't do. Too big chance of running for nothing, and I got my own affairs.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_122"><text>Fair. Deal.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_131"><text>Decide yourself. Won't offer second time.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_start_132"><text>That's good. See you.</text></string>
<string id="tex_voron_artist_article"><text>Raven asked to look at old regional committee dacha, in Swamps, for traces of missing Artist. He might have album with notes and sketches about Zone, should take it along. In any case - return and tell about everything seen</text></string>

<string id="voron_artist_done_0"><text>Hi, Raven! Went to Swamps on your errand, found stalker's corpse at regional committee dacha, and in his things - interesting little album.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_done_1"><text>So Zone took Artist after all. Pity, he was talented guy. Well, show me your find.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_done_21"><text>Here. By the way, if you're interested, bloodsucker made lair at regional committee dacha. Seems he finished off the guy. Corpse was like dried mummy. Turns out, no mysticism.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_done_22"><text>Moment... where is it?! Seems I dropped it somewhere. I'll be right back...</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_done_3"><text>Well-well, turns out so. Alright, payment from me. Decided yet, take excellent artifact or stash tip interests you?</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_done_41"><text>If artifact's really excellent, then better take it.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_done_42"><text>Artifacts are replaceable, but what's in stash... Very curious. Tell me where to look. Hope it's worth it.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_done_51"><text>For well done job should pay accordingly - such is my belief. Here's your artifact. You passed test, now I'm ready to cooperate with you regularly.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_done_521"><text>As you say. Info's verified, from one reliable middleman, but without exact directions. For exact ones he asks decent surcharge, and that's not always profitable for me.\nSo, one soldier hid stolen ammo in backpack at Agroprom. Look for it on pipe, in middle of local swamp.\nThat's all. You passed test, now I'm ready to cooperate with you regularly.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_done_522"><text>As you say. Info's verified, from one reliable middleman, but without exact directions. For exact ones he asks decent surcharge, and that's not always profitable for me.\nSo, one soldier hid stolen ammo in backpack at Agroprom. On hill, near local swamp, trail to Yantar starts. Look for it in that area.\nThat's all. You passed test, now I'm ready to cooperate with you regularly.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_done_523"><text>As you say. Info's verified, from one reliable middleman, but without exact directions. For exact ones he asks decent surcharge, and that's not always profitable for me.\nSo, one soldier hid stolen ammo in backpack at Agroprom. It should lie somewhere by power lines, on road to Forgotten Farm.\nThat's all. You passed test, now I'm ready to cooperate with you regularly.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_done_61"><text>Thanks, glad to hear it. I'll drop by from time to time.</text></string>
<string id="voron_artist_done_62"><text>Oh, hope won't regret not taking artifact right away. Take care, dealer. I'll drop by from time to time.</text></string>

<string id="voron_collection_dialog_0"><text>Raven, what about orders for collectors?</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_11"><text>Got small list of wanted items, sending to your PDA now. I'll clarify right away: broken, worn to holes and other junk doesn't interest me. All things should be, if not in perfect condition, then at least in good. Payment - tip about worthy stash, same scheme as when you checked info about Artist. If no suitable stash available, I'll pay with artifact. No deadlines, but you're not only one involved in these searches. Someone might be quicker. Questions?</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_12"><text>I already gave you wanted list, nothing new. Did you manage to find something?</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_21"><text>Seems clear. I'll go read your little list.</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_3"><text>Yeah. Got one interesting thing, result of dark genius work from Cordon... I mean Vergas. Look, this is his electronic notebook. Everything works, condition... excellent... probably.</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_31"><text>You could also say "not crashed, not painted". Alright, works - already good. Now about reward. One of experienced left backpack with loot in Rookie Village, Sidor was away then. And then owner himself "went away" to other world. Hidden somewhere in attics. That's all, find something else from list - bring it.</text></string>

That's all, find something else from list - bring it.</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_4"><text>Got coat, inherited from former Borov's buddy. Seems that same one from your list, see for yourself.</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_41"><text>Yes, can see right away it's not mass production, tailoring clearly made to individual order, even has master's monogram. Write down stash tip, it's in Wild Territory. Mercenaries shot group of stalkers there, and hid part of loot in backpack, near unfinished building, behind railway tracks. That's all, find something else from list - bring it.</text></string>

<string id="voron_collection_dialog_5"><text>Yeah, took such vest from soldier at Yantar. This is the one you need, Berill-7MT? I heard somewhere it has special lining impregnation that speeds wound healing.</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_51"><text>Excellent, what customer needs! Who told you about impregnation? Vest's really special, but for other reasons... But that doesn't matter. Listen where to look for stash. One of wealthy hunters in Swamps recently became prey himself for local creatures. Known that he had stash - ordinary backpack, lies in some container, near road to us, to Valley. That's all, find something else from list - bring it.</text></string>

Listen where to look for stash. One of wealthy hunters in Swamps recently became prey himself for local creatures.

<string id="voron_collection_dialog_6"><text>I was descending into an underground laboratory, found a corpse in such a distinctive suit there. I'd bet it belonged to Ghost himself. He's number 4 on your list. Is it him?</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_61"><text>Let me see... And yes - it's him! Looks like a regular "Zarya" suit, right? But in reality, the layout here is more successful, meaning you get less tired, excellent night vision is built in, and protection is significantly enhanced compared to the base model. Now listen carefully, I'll tell you about the stash. I think it's been there since the Clear Sky times. As you probably guessed, it's in the Swamps. Look for a backpack near the sunken tugboat, the military set up an outpost nearby. That's it, find something else from the list - bring it over.</text></string>

Now listen carefully, I'll tell you about the stash. I think it's been there since the Clear Sky times. As you probably guessed, it's in the Swamps. Look for a backpack at an old stalker camp with two fire pits, located roughly halfway between the western military outpost and the small oil refinery. That's it, find something else from the list - bring it over.</text></string>

<string id="voron_collection_dialog_7"><text>Believe it or not, I managed to get my hands on an experimental Gravi suit. That was quite the deal! Its protective characteristics are pretty lousy, of course, but you can really work like a dump truck, hauling 200 kg of cargo. Check it out yourself.</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_71"><text>No way! And I wasn't even fully convinced they existed. Yeah... in something like that you could haul a whole pile of loot out of the Zone at once... or bring it in. Awesome! Remember how to find your reward. The eggheads at Yantar were conducting field research, but something went wrong for them - they bolted so fast they left all their equipment behind. Look for a backpack in a swamp with an islet in the center, where a big metal thing is lying around. That's it, find something else from the list - bring it over.</text></string>

<string id="voron_collection_dialog_8"><text>I'd bet you've never been brought such a power suit. That's exactly what the Monolith guys strut around in. I've seen it myself personally.</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_81"><text>Interesting, how did you manage to find an approach to those fanatics?! Though, that's a secondary question. The main thing is that you really managed to get your hands on the rarest specimen. I think a fitting reward awaits you. My middleman learned about a place where mercenaries regularly leave ammunition for their raiding groups operating deep in the Zone. Warning: think ahead about protection from electrical discharges - you'll have to trek to "Tesla". There, as usual, look for a backpack. It should be hidden in the southeastern part of that area, on a fenced territory where, according to rumors, there's a descent into some secret bunker. Look carefully around the entrance gates. That's it, find something else from the list - bring it over.</text></string>

<string id="voron_collection_dialog_9"><text>Both find it and restore it to working condition. This is a flamethrower made by Screw, Freedom's mechanic. It looked pretty pitiful when it first came into my hands. But now, as you can see, after being serviced by the master himself, it once again looks like a formidable weapon.</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_91"><text>Deadly, ya say? Gotta test it on the flesh. They keep crawlin' into our camp. Maybe with this contraption I can finally drive them off for good? You did excellent work, Marked One. Let's get to the handout. Don't know how, but the middleman sniffed out a place where Sultan's punks-smugglers leave orders for some rich foreign scumbag. Like a VIP client they got, he's into sniping. Rumor has it, he's one hell of a bastard. Likes organizing hunts on people, greenhorn rookies mostly. Anyway... His orders are left at the Sanatorium. Look for a backpack in one of the halls, on the second tier. That's it, find something else from the list - bring it over.</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_1"><text>Not yet. And nothing new, then? I'll drop by some other time.</text></string>
<string id="voron_collection_dialog_2"><text>Definitely. See ya.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_artist_start_0"><text>Hey there, guys! You... uh... haven't happened to find a stalker's corpse around here by any chance? Or maybe someone heard strange voices?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_artist_start_1"><text>Marked One, are you drunk or what? What corpses, what voices? Go sleep it off.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_artist_start_2"><text>No way, I'm clear as glass! It's just that a strange story happened here recently, I want to figure it out...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_artist_start_3"><text>Strange stories happen in the Zone every day, you'd barely keep up writing them down just so you don't forget after a week. There's one guy, everyone calls him Artist, he's an expert in this field, knows many different tales and legends. I bet he's in the know about your "strange story" too. Try him, if you can find him first, of course. Haven't heard hide nor hair of him for quite a while...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_artist_start_4"><text>There are no such coincidences...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_artist_start_5"><text>What? What are you talking about?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_artist_start_6"><text>Nothing... I'm going.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_artist_have_0"><text>Hey, protectors of humanity! Are you guys even aware that a bloodsucker has set up a lair right above your heads? Plus he drained a man dry, maybe more than one...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_artist_have_1"><text>Tone it down before you get smacked! First of all, we don't sit here 24/7, and second, when we checked out this place, we looked all around - it was clean. Or do you think we should now peek behind every bush in the Gut daily since we've settled here?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_artist_have_2"><text>Behind every bush you don't need to, but right under your nose...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_artist_have_3"><text>Well, there was some unclear noise from the attic a few days ago. I went up to look, turned out an owl was settling in for the day. You can't go running to check every rustle. And in my time serving in Duty I've learned to trust my instincts. And it told me it was safe here.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_artist_have_4"><text>I see Duty has an answer for everything, just so nothing comes back to them... I'm going. You guys... at least bury the poor guy properly.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_artist_have_5"><text>Of course we'll bury him. He's gonna start stinking soon - don't want to smell that. Get going.</text></string>

<string id="voron_garmonika_dialog_0"><text>I came across something here, a harmonica...</text></string>
<string id="voron_garmonika_dialog_1"><text>Big deal, there's tons of those harmonicas in the Zone - every third person's got one, probably...</text></string>
<string id="voron_garmonika_dialog_2"><text>Don't interrupt, listen! There's a note inside, like a cipher.</text></string>
<string id="voron_garmonika_dialog_3"><text>A cipher? Interesting... And why to me?</text></string>
<string id="voron_garmonika_dialog_41"><text>There's a name here - Raven! Look for yourself...</text></string>
<string id="voron_garmonika_dialog_42"><text>There was a name - Raven! I made a copy, take a look...</text></string>
<string id="voron_garmonika_dialog_52"><text>There's plenty of Ravens roaming the Zone!\nYes, indeed, a cipher. Judging by everything, this place with words is the cipher key, I think letters represent numbers. And where it says "shift", that's the shift of alphabet letters or numbers in the cipher itself.</text></string>
<string id="voron_garmonika_dialog_51"><text>Hmm, familiar thing... Where'd you find it?</text></string>
<string id="voron_garmonika_dialog_61"><text>Took it off a bandit's corpse. So is this something important or not?</text></string>
<string id="voron_garmonika_dialog_8"><text>Think it's important? Can you decode it?</text></string>
<string id="voron_garmonika_dialog_9"><text>No bro, I can't... Need a brainy guy for this... Listen! Try getting Docent to puzzle over it! You know, the one who hangs around at the Bar with Lanky... He'll definitely crack this puzzle.</text></string>
<string id="voron_garmonika_dialog_71"><text>Off a corpse, you say... Yes, indeed, a cipher.\nAh! By the way, see the corner of the cipher torn off, right here, where the word "Raven" ends? So this might not be "Raven", could be, say, "Ravine" or "Ravenkov", or who knows...\nJudging by everything, this place with words is the cipher key, I think letters represent numbers. And where it says "shift", that's the shift of alphabet letters or numbers in the cipher itself.</text></string>

<string id="esc_zoneguard_start_251"><text>Oh, you. Anyway, Dan here gave us a talking-to. Like "We're hunters, not gutter trash. We should be ensuring Zone cleanup..."

<string id="esc_zoneguard_start_401"><text>You've gotten tough, Marked One, move along already...</text></string>

<string id="esc_zoneguard_actor_4"><text>Then turn around and get out of here...</text></string>
	
<string id="barmen_new_start_101"><text>Well, greetings, stalker! Haven't seen you around before... What's your name?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_102"><text>Hello to you too. I'm Marked One...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_103"><text>Marked One? No, haven't heard that name. New to the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_104"><text>Not really, I think. I don't remember! I'm looking for people who might know me or have information about Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_105"><text>Strelok is a legendary figure, but nothing's been heard about him for a long time. Talk to the folks around here, maybe someone will recognize you or give you some advice.</text></string>

<string id="barmen_new_start_151"><text>So, Marked One? Found anyone?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_152"><text>Not yet. I'll talk around some more...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_153"><text>Go ahead. Maybe you need something?</text></string>

<string id="barmen_new_start_201"><text>Uh... Marked One, I take it? I received a message from Sidorovich about you. The old bug didn't hesitate to even list your distinguishing features for safety's sake, and your appearance catches the eye, so don't be surprised I recognized you right away.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_202"><text>Yes, I'm Marked One. And I've heard about you too.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_203"><text>Good. Consider we've saved time on mutual pleasantries. So, I know you want to find someone and are looking to get further north, right?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_204"><text>Generally - yes. But not exactly. I'm looking for a stalker called Strelok, as well as those who know him or me. And I need to go north mainly because... It's just that there are higher chances of finding answers to my questions there.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_205"><text>I see. Look, here's the thing: we traders have long been looking for ways to penetrate beyond the Brain Scorcher. Sidorovich probably already told you about this. The papers you brought him mention a certain laboratory X-18, which by description resembles abandoned underground facilities in Dark Valley. In that laboratory, as it turned out, parts for an experimental installation were manufactured, the operating principle of which is similar to that of the Scorcher. You get what I'm driving at?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_206"><text>Not really. Sidorovich and I are settled, I completed his task. But what do you need from me?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_207"><text>What do I need... Your Strelok knew a lot of interesting things, apparently even the road to the center of the Zone. And maybe he's still somewhere out there now. I want you to go to X-18 and try to find any documentation there related to the work that was conducted there. There's a chance we can learn how to safely bypass the psi-emission fields. Then the path deep into the Zone for you... well, and for others, of course, will be open. You can ask the Monolith to restore your memory. Heh-heh. Just kidding.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_2071"><text>Jokes aside, in my situation I'd believe even a legend if other ways to restore memory don't work. And actually Strelok might be somewhere out there... Alright, I agree. How do I get to this laboratory of yours?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_2072"><text>You put it all so nicely, esteemed. But I'll probably refuse for now. Maybe later.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_2081"><text>Excellent! I don't know exactly where the laboratory entrance is, but there's reliable information that this is known to Borov - the leader of the scumbag gang from Dark Valley. Try to get it out of him. If you haven't been to the Valley yet, at the Duty checkpoint on the Garbage, you'll learn how to get there quickly.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_2082"><text>Your choice, Marked One. Just know: this is the only lead so far that will help us open the road deep into the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_209"><text>And how, in your opinion, should I make this bandit talk? And will he even listen to me at all? How do I avoid getting a bullet in the forehead right away in your Valley...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_210"><text>Everything in this world is solvable, Marked One. You're a new person, haven't particularly shown yourself... See the guy at the bar? Goes by Tooth, he has many connections with various factions. Try discussing this matter with him.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_211"><text>I sense this particular "solution" is gonna cost me a pretty penny. Alright, got it.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_212"><text>Well, good if you got it. I'll be waiting for news. Good luck!</text></string>

<string id="barmen_new_start_301"><text>Hey there, Marked One! I got a message from Sidorovich about you. I know you're looking for Strelok and trying to get further north, right?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_302"><text>Generally - yes. Except I need to go north mainly because... It's just that there are higher chances of finding answers to my questions there.</text></string>

<string id="barmen_new_start_310"><text>Well, good if you got it. I'll be waiting for news. Good luck!</text></string>

<string id="barmen_new_start_351"><text>You were planning to head to Dark Valley, Marked One?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_352"><text>Need to prepare, pick up some gear...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_353"><text>Well, if I can help somehow...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_401"><text>Ah, there you are, Marked One... Been to the laboratory? Find anything?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4021"><text>Found a damn basement. Here's what was there.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4022"><text>Hmm... Seemed like there were some papers...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4031"><text>Let's see... Formulas, charts, blueprints... Don't breathe down my neck, need to figure this out. Go on, have a drink while I work. Ah... Here's a small present for managing to crawl through where cockroaches can't fit... Just kidding, just kidding! Relax.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4032"><text>Should've taken them... Instead of counting crows! Different rumors go around here about these laboratories. What to believe? Well, see for yourself. No papers - no road north...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_411"><text>Still fussing around? You look bad. Better get some rest.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_412"><text>I'll rest. Later. What's been clarified from the documents?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_413"><text>We're studying. When something comes up - I won't forget about you.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_421"><text>The situation is becoming clear. As I suspected, the Brain Scorcher is man-made. It's Kaymanov's experimental emitter, its parts were manufactured in laboratory X-18. These documents reference laboratory X-16, where the finished blocks were sent. According to fragmentary data, this laboratory is located on the territory of an industrial complex near Yantar lake.\nHmm... And I heard quite recently that someone managed to get into this X-16 from Red Forest... Strange. So, about Yantar. There's a scientists' camp nearby, they'll surely give more precise directions.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_404"><text>What about Red Forest and how to get there?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_405"><text>There was this half-mad guy here. Said his partner found some tunnel in Red Forest that leads to an underground lab. Only this talker was too scared to go there himself, and his partner never came back... No! Who knows what stalkers babble when drunk... And I won't tell you about the path to Red Forest. Ask around the warehouses, maybe someone will point you in the right direction.\nBut first, it's better to get to the scientists at Yantar and find out where exactly laboratory X-16 is located. Need to get the missing part of the documents. That's the main thing.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4051"><text>And why me? Look how many loafers are in the bar...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4052"><text>Exactly, loafers... They might not go, they'll say: "We're fed pretty well here too." Or they'll sit down somewhere halfway and get drunk, forgetting all about business. And time doesn't wait. I know you don't need this for money. You're personally invested, so only you can be relied upon.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4053"><text>Where does this concern for me come from and how do you know what I need?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4054"><text>Don't nitpick the words. You've already been noticed by many in the Zone. You yourself tell everyone you want to restore your memory... Well, are you ready?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4061"><text>Alright, I'm ready. But if I didn't need to go to Yantar myself, I wouldn't go.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4071"><text>That's excellent. I'm sending you coordinates of the crossing point to Wild Territory, beyond it is Yantar. I'll be waiting.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4062"><text>No, I'm not ready yet.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4072"><text>Get ready, Marked One. Such business can't wait long.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_451"><text>So, shall we begin? Ready for a trip to Yantar?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4521"><text>Alright, I'll try to find out what's there...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4522"><text>I'm not planning to go to Yantar yet...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4531"><text>That's excellent. I'm sending you coordinates of the crossing point to Wild Territory, beyond it is Yantar. I'll be waiting.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_4532"><text>Get ready, Marked One. Such business can't wait long.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_501"><text>I thought you were already at Yantar... What's up?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_551"><text>So, Marked One, got the documents from X-16 with you?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_5521"><text>Yeah, here they are.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_5522"><text>No.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_5532"><text>That's your business, of course, but... Without these documents our cause won't move forward!</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_55311"><text>Really been to that hellish place? Didn't expect it from you. You're lucky, or just... Well, whatever... I'll pass this to Docent now, let him think it over... Accept gratitude from all of stalkerdom! In material form. Maybe you'll relax a bit. And write down the recipe... from me personally.\nOh yes, about Docent! He was waiting for you, wanted to give you something, or return something, or tell you something... Ask him yourself.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_55312"><text>Really been to that hellish place? Didn't expect it from you. You're lucky, or just... Well, whatever... I'll pass this to Docent now, let him think it over... Accept gratitude from all of stalkerdom! In material form. Maybe you'll relax a bit.

<string id="barmen_new_start_55313"><text>Really been to that hellish place? Didn't expect it from you. You're lucky, or just... Well, whatever... I'll pass this to Docent now, let him think it over... Accept gratitude from all of stalkerdom! In material form. Maybe you'll relax a bit. And write down the recipe... from me personally.\nOh yes, about Docent! He was waiting for you, wanted to give you something, or return something, or tell you something... Ask him yourself.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_601"><text>Marked One, with all due respect... What did you want?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_651"><text>Well, Marked One, only thing left is to deal with the Scorcher and open passage to the North. Ready to head out now?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_6521"><text>Ready.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_6522"><text>Not yet! Let me at least catch my breath.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_6532"><text>Rest, of course! Drink, eat... relax.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_6531"><text>So here's the deal, Marked One. According to the documents, the Scorcher's emission is of the same nature as at Yantar... Docent scanned the data onto a flash drive, give it to Sakharov. I marked on the map exactly where stalkers died trying to break through to the center. The control bunker for the Brain Scorcher is also mentioned. I sent you the bunker coordinates. There's a reference to an entry code - 23486. Try it...\nPossibly, that's where the entire system can be shut down. So it's necessary to break through to the bunker under the antennas as quickly as possible and turn off the Scorcher. What happens next, I don't know, but I feel: it's worth it. I know one thing for sure: the Scorcher won't interfere with breaking through to the center of the Zone after this. And what's there... God knows.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_6541"><text>Continue.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_6542"><text>Wait, wait! Point the way with your finger! Otherwise - bunker, coordinates...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_6551"><text>All that needs to be done is find out from Sakharov about the possibility of reaching the bunker under the antennas in sound mind and shutting them down. Everything clear?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_6552"><text>Damn it! Well there, go through the northern checkpoint along the road north. There'll be the territory of former Army Warehouses, a village, and a stinking swamp. Keep going without paying attention to the stoned Freedomers... and there the Scorcher will soon manifest itself. Can't miss it!\nAll that needs to be done is find out from Sakharov about the possibility of reaching the bunker under the antennas and shutting them down. Everything clear?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_6561"><text>That's clear. What's not clear is why you've dumped all this on me: X-18, X-16, now the Scorcher? What's this interest in my person? One might think there's no one else around. Maybe you're not interested in the center of the Zone, but Strelok himself?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_6562"><text>I wouldn't mind having a chat with Strelok, of course. But somehow you got it all wrong.</text></string>	
<string id="barmen_new_start_6563"><text>Got it how I got it. In short: you showed me the way... Maybe I'll go there, but I'd advise you to find other daredevils for now.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_6571"><text>As you wish... I'll look for them, but don't you delay either.\nOh yes, one more thing! The Duty commander needs a volunteer for some mission at Army Warehouses, if you're interested, you can visit him. If you haven't had dealings with them yet, I'll arrange with the guards, they'll let you through.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_701"><text>Hello, Marked One. Time goes by, but you don't change, still the same unsociable. Sit down, have a drink, maybe you'll soften up a bit.</text></string>
<!-- mike -->
<string id="barmen_new_start_801"><text>Oh! Marked One! What brings you here?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_802"><text>Listen, I was in the bunker under the Scorcher. You got something mixed up! There's no control panel there! I turned everything upside down!</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_803"><text>Ah! I sent you a message in pursuit. Didn't you get it? Turned out to be a mistake. Outdated information. I figured right away it was too easy! Well, never mind, the main thing is you stayed alive. Others managed to find a way to shut down that damn Scorcher.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_804"><text>Well then... How's that? And, most importantly, where?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_805"><text>Don't know where, I'm not the one who shut it down. But don't worry about it. You're independent now, decide for yourself what and when to do. Not noticing anything, by the way?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_806"><text>What should I notice? Did you pluck your eyebrows or something?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_807"><text>Oh, you! And you seem to have been in the Zone for more than a day. The population left is - one, two and you're done counting! They shut down the Scorcher! The guys from Ivar's group, haven't heard of them? They also call themselves "Seekers". Ivar, though, returned to the Bar alone, but none of his group can be seen.\nWell, never mind. So here it is, he found the weak spot of that damned Brain Scorcher after all. Now everyone who can throw bolts has moved toward the center, to Pripyat, and even further. It's become empty here... Now, probably, there's enough profit for everyone! It's an untouched Klondike there!</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_808"><text>Ivar... I think I heard something about him. And who is he? Been in the Zone long? Maybe if he figured out how to turn off that radar brain-crusher, he knows other Zone secrets too? For example, about Strelok...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_809"><text>The questions you have, of course... Ivar is from the Baltics it seems, and they're serious people. Don't know about Strelok. Maybe they're acquainted. Try asking him yourself if you can. He's a bit out of it after Radar.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_810"><text>Out of it? Meaning?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_811"><text>Yeah, seems the radiation got to him. Don't know what happened to the others from his group, but when he came, he still spoke normally, but then each day got worse and worse. Now he mumbles something, sometimes coherently, sometimes not so much. Though sometimes his head clears up and he speaks quite decently.</text></string> 
<string id="barmen_new_start_812"><text>So he's still here somewhere?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_813"><text>Here, here. Where would he go now in such a state?\nFeel bad for the guy... He was trying to treat zombified stalkers himself. They say that's why he came here. Like he was a brain doctor, treated all kinds of psychos. And here, see how it turned out. He's practically turning into a zombified stalker before our eyes...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_814"><text>Brain doctor, you say? Interesting... And can't he be helped anymore?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_815"><text>Who would help if even he couldn't de-zombify anyone? I heard he managed to bring someone to their senses temporarily, someone who hadn't been under brain-frying too much, but that's just... People talk all kinds of things, you know yourself.\nI put out a request on the network, so if anyone meets the Doctor, they'd call him to the Bar urgently. If he can't help, then probably no one can anymore.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_816"><text>I see. Alright, I'll try to talk with Ivar myself.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_817"><text>Try it. Don't rush, rest a bit, you don't look good. Like after a wild hangover. As if you too... Bah, bah.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_841"><text>Marked One? By the way, you never said where you've been wandering all this time.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_842"><text>I already told you: was crawling underground at that Scorcher. Got hearing problems?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_843"><text>Come on now... And honestly, between us, where were you missing for two weeks? Come on, spill it. Been drinking somewhere all this time, and then when you heard the Scorcher was turned off, remembered and showed up - like to save face, saying you were there but didn't find anything... Wanted to play hero. So, am I right? Will you tell?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_844"><text>What are you babbling about?! Nothing to tell you. But those two weeks... that's interesting to me too.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_845"><text>Well if you don't want to, as you wish...\nOh! Some guy was asking about you here a couple times, but you were nowhere to be found.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_846"><text>As if some woman could be asking about me here... What did he want?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_847"><text>Hell if I know. He's got something about Strelok for you it seems.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_848"><text>And who is he? Where to look?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_849"><text>Don't know, he didn't introduce himself. Seemed to come to Sultan. Probably one of his people. He's already gone... Can't remember where they hang out - some village, look there if you want. I thought you'd be interested, you keep asking about Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_8050"><text>Yeah, ask anyone here and they all "know" something about Strelok. And this one's probably one of those same experts. So he'll find me himself if he really needs to... Don't have time to run around the Village looking for who knows who.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_8051"><text>What do I care, right?\nAh, I forgot! He was talking about something with Ivar while he could still speak clearly. Don't know what they were discussing, but they parted on bad terms.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_80511"><text>How do you know?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_80512"><text>It happened right here in the bar in front of me. I wasn't eavesdropping - none of my business, but I definitely heard Strelok's name.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_80513"><text>Again go there, don't know where...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_80514"><text>What are you talking about?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_80515"><text>Just to myself... Thinking about where to head next.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_80516"><text>Don't think. Head north, you were striving to get there yourself. Everyone's already rushed north. The main thing in our business is loot, and they'll be dragging it in sacks soon... Only somehow they're not bringing any yet, should be time already...</text></string>

<string id="barmen_new_start_851"><text>How's life? Should get some rest, you look terrible.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_901"><text>Hey there. Why so out of breath?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_902"><text>Been running here from the station after barely getting your message. Just kidding. Better tell me, what's this important information you have? Why did you call me?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_903"><text>You're sharp as diarrhea. Also a joke.\nYou were interested in a stalker called Ghost, as I heard? He was here recently, asking about you. As I understood, he's looking to meet with you.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_904"><text>Really? Imagine that, I also want to have a close "chat" with him! And where is he?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_905"><text>At Radar. At least he asked me to tell you he'll be waiting for you there for a few more days at some crossroads. That's all. No need to thank me - Ghost paid for my intermediary services.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_new_start_951"><text>How's it going? Alright? Well, that's good.</text></string>

<string id="borov_key_dialog_0"><text>I need information from Borov, can you help?</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_1"><text>I can help arrange a meeting with him if you do something...</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_11"><text>I was told that Borov got whacked... As for what he might have known, well...</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_12"><text>I was told that Borov got whacked... And you were seen there. Confess, was it your doing? Probably took a big score? Yeah?</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_2"><text>Can you be more specific?</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_21"><text>Don't beat around the bush, let's be more specific...</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_22"><text>Uh... I didn't take anything! I need to find out what Borov knew. Can you help?</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_3"><text>More specific? Can be more specific...\nRecently I and several worthy people concluded a weapons and equipment supply contract. With whom, you ask? I answer: the less you know - the better you sleep.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_31"><text>More specific? Can be more specific...\nThere's one little guy who learned a lot of Borov's secrets. So you give me twenty grand, I give you a tip - where this rat can be found.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_32"><text>Playing coy? Your business. Why kill that guy if you need something from him now? Alright.\nThere's one little guy who learned a lot of Borov's secrets. So you give me a hundred grand, I give you a tip where this rat can be found.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_4"><text>So what's the problem?</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_41"><text>Isn't that too much? Well alright, I'll transfer it...</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_42"><text>Don't have that much cash right now.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_421"><text>Isn't that too much?! Well alright, I'll transfer it...</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_422"><text>What?! Don't have that much cash right now.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_5"><text>The problem is the caravan didn't reach the meeting point. The escort, my man, reported they were attacked and he'd try to hide in a safe place. No word from him since... I'd ask you, as payment for the service, to find out what happened to our cargo.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_51"><text>Not much. What's money? Trash... According to my information, this Rat was seen in the Gut, skulking around the gas station somewhere. Hurry up, maybe you'll catch him alive.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_52"><text>Not much. What's money? Trash... According to my information, this Rat was seen in the Gut, skulking around the gas station somewhere. Hurry up, maybe you'll catch him alive.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_61"><text>Alright, let's see what kind of rat this is...</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_6"><text>If I agree, where would I need to go?</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_7"><text>Last contact with my man was from Swamp. And if he's not responding anymore, something happened.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_81"><text>Alright, I'll head over there... How will I recognize your man?</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_82"><text>And how do I get there? I've heard of Swamp, but don't know the way. Only know a path to Forgotten Village, seems from there to Swamp is a stone's throw if judging by the map.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_92"><text>Yeah, they say there's a short road from the Village to Swamp. Go there, talk to people. Maybe someone will point the way.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_93"><text>I'll go... Who should I look for at Swamp?</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_83"><text>And how do I get there? I've heard of Swamp, but don't know the way. Seems from Forgotten Village to Swamp is a stone's throw if judging by the map, but I don't know the way there either. Alright, then it didn't work out, I'll look for approaches to Borov myself.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_84"><text>Trudge through swamp mud? No, I'll probably do without your services. I'll try to find an approach to Borov myself.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_9"><text>His name is Mueller. He's a mercenary, but honest, and if he took an advance, he'll complete the job. He's hiding in a village somewhere in the northern part. I suppose he might be wounded, if not worse... So don't waste time, head out immediately.</text></string>
<string id="borov_key_dialog_10"><text>Alright, I'm off to Swamp, and you prepare a meeting with Borov.</text></string>

<string id="bar_korovan"><text>Missing Caravan</text></string>
<string id="tex_bar_korovan_0"><text>A weapons caravan went missing at Agroprom. Need to find Mueller, the mercenary escorting the caravan. Last known location: he's hiding in one of the villages in the northeast of Swamp</text></string>
<string id="tex_bar_korovan_1"><text>Mueller received severe radioactive exposure. Need to bring him two anti-radiation drugs within 6 hours</text></string>
<string id="tex_bar_korovan_2"><text>Mueller wrote a note with encrypted coordinates, need to give this note to Tooth</text></string>
<string id="tex_bar_korovan_3"><text>The note contains coordinates of the cargo drop location. Need to verify if this is really the caravan cargo Tooth was talking about. Need to examine the crates</text></string>
<string id="tex_bar_korovan_4"><text>The caravan cargo was found at the specified coordinates. Need to report this to Tooth as soon as possible before the military gets involved</text></string>
<string id="zapiska_muller"><text>Mueller's Note</text></string>
<string id="enc_zapiska_muller"><text>Mueller scribbled some incomprehensible squiggles, says it's encrypted coordinates of the cargo location...</text></string>

<string id="muller_start_dialog_101"><text>What do you want, stalker? Can't you see I'm in bad shape?</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_102"><text>I can see. Who are you and what happened?</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_103"><text>I'm Mueller. Me and my comrades ran into a military ambush, had to run for it... Caught radiation up to my eyeballs...</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_104"><text>And I'm looking for you, Mueller. I'm from Tooth. Where's the weapons caravan?</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_105"><text>Help me, brother, and I'll tell you everything, honest as hell... I feel like I got three hours left if I don't take anti-rad... Two...</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1061"><text>I got a couple anti-rads, let me inject you...</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1062"><text>I got a bottle of vodka, drink up, should help a little.</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1063"><text>Damn, I don't have anti-rads, where can I find them?</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1071"><text>Whoa, thank you... I'll remember this forever!\nAs I was saying, the soldiers attacked us. Combat escort got wiped out immediately, but I managed to escape through the radioactive swamp. Here, give Tooth this note with ambush coordinates. I think the cargo's still there. Only Tooth knows the note's cipher. Get to him, I'll back away from death's door...</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1081"><text>Alright, recover. I'm off to the Bar.</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1091"><text>Wait! I got nothing to give you now, but I can compensate for expenses. I got a stash nearby, at Forgotten Village. There's a house... don't know how to describe it exactly. Anyway, you'll find it yourself, there aren't many. And in the attic I hid some medical supplies.</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1092"><text>Wait! I got nothing to give you now, but I can compensate for expenses. I got a stash nearby, at Forgotten Village. There's a house... don't know how to describe it exactly. Anyway, you'll find it yourself, there aren't many. And in the attic I hid some medical supplies.\nBy the way, if you don't know, there's one path from here that leads straight to Forgotten Village. Here... look at the map.</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1093"><text>That'll come in handy, thanks.</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1072"><text>Thanks... Now I'll last longer, about three hours... I got a stash nearby, at Forgotten Village... In the attic of a house, there's a box with various medicines... Hurry.</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1082"><text>Hang in there, I'll find anti-rads...</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1073"><text>I got a stash nearby, at Forgotten Village... In the attic of a house, there's a box with various medicines... Hurry.</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_10831"><text>At Forgotten Village? By the time I get there, how much time will pass...</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1084"><text>There's a short path from here. Here... look at the map. Hurry, please...</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1083"><text>I'll find anti-rads... Hang on!</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_151"><text>Is that you? Ugh... it's dark...</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1521"><text>Found anti-rads, let me inject you...</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_1522"><text>Hold on a little longer...</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_153"><text>Whoa, thank you... Almost kicked the bucket! I'll remember this forever!\nAs I was saying, the soldiers attacked us. Combat escort got wiped out immediately, but I managed to escape through the radioactive swamp. Here, give Tooth this note with ambush coordinates. I think the cargo's still there. Only Tooth knows the note's cipher. Get to him, I'll back away from death's door...</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_154"><text>Alright, recover. I'm off to the Bar.</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_201"><text>Oh, it's my savior! Greetings! What's your name? I forgot to ask right away?</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_202"><text>Hello to you too. Call me Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_203"><text>Thank you again, Marked One! I owe you...</text></string>
<string id="muller_start_dialog_251"><text>Marked One? Need something? Don't forget, I'll do anything for you...</text></string>

<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_101"><text>Marked One, is that you? Hey there, wanderer! Small world, and the Zone's even smaller. What brings you here?</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_102"><text>Hey there. Yeah, just been running around here on my business...</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_103"><text>Being secretive? Come on, your business is your business, doesn't concern me.\nListen, I never properly thanked you for saving me back then at Swamp. Here, take some ammunition. Can't give more, sorry. We don't have it like in the army, but some bookkeeping still exists.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_104"><text>Well, thanks. I'll be going, business doesn't wait.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_105"><text>Wait, Marked One. Maybe you'd agree to help me with something? Not for free, of course.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_201"><text>Good to see you, Marked One! You showed up at just the right time. Won't you help me with something? Not for free, of course.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_202"><text>If it's some wet work, that's not for me, I'll say right now.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_203"><text>What wet work, what's wrong with you? I need a new suit, same as the one I'm wearing. This one got torn up in several places after my misadventures, the mask cracked, and it still radiates a bit even though I washed it as best I could. I ordered it back on the mainland, but I know there's a master in the Zone who sews these too. What do you think, could you find this craftsman and pay for his work? Don't think I want to boss you around like some lackey. Would've gone myself, but the boss ordered no one leave camp - business is about to go down.\nIf you manage to get me new gear, you can choose the reward yourself: modificate recipe, the modificate itself, or a rare gun. What do you say?</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_2041"><text>Sounds good. Deal.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_2042"><text>On one hand it's tempting, but on the other... Too much hassle, sorry Mueller, but I'll pass.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_2051"><text>That's great. Honestly, it's embarrassing to show off in front of comrades in a torn suit...</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_2052"><text>Well, as you wish. I'll have to arrange through Tooth with someone, and he'll take his commission... Alright, not your problem.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_301"><text>Hey there, bro! How's it going with my suit? Any progress?</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_3021"><text>And stay healthy, Mueller. All good, you can try on the new gear.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_3022"><text>Nothing yet. Just dropped by to say hello.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_303"><text>Sweet! Even better than what I had. People really know their craft! You did me a solid, Marked One, no doubt. Now, as agreed, choose how I'll thank you.\nRecently info came through our channels about a recipe for "Porcupine" modificate. One comrade - now deceased - even risked trying it... Why the long face? Ha-ha! No, don't worry, he didn't die from that "brewing" experiment. That was later. So, want to learn the recipe or prefer to feel the artifact itself? I know where the deceased stashed the resulting artifact. If neither interests you, I recommend taking payment with this gun - "FN F2000 Tactical". Gorgeous piece. They delivered a batch to us recently, everyone's pissing boiling water from joy.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_3041"><text>Let it be the recipe. Never know what artifact might come in handy tomorrow. Some you can't find in the field with a magnifying glass.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_3042"><text>I prefer real loot. Tell me where to look for the artifact.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_3043"><text>What's this "FN F2000 Tactical"? Never heard of it. But if you recommend it... Here goes nothing!</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_3051"><text>Oh, these stalker complications. One moment, I'll upload everything to your PDA...</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_30521"><text>Uh... there's one snag. You see, I was never close friends with that comrade, and learned about the stash with the artifact after his death by hacking his PDA. Anyway, can't name the exact location, but judging by the records from the palmtop, should look in Limansk, in the courtyard in front of the house where Freedomers and stalkers constantly hang out.\nThe deceased didn't have the artifact on him, and before that we were together watching some goner... but that doesn't matter. What matters is he was in sight almost all the time, so couldn't have sold the artifact either. I'm sure that modificate is still lying in the stash.</text></string>

<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_3053"><text>There, right choice! I'd take the weapon too if I were you, when offered. Don't worry, you'll be satisfied, I guarantee it.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_3061"><text>Yeah, got it. Alright, good luck.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_3062"><text>Yeah, better hope it's where it should be... which still needs to be found first. Well, not the first time. Alright, good luck.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_3063"><text>Hmm... looks unusual. Alright, I'll get used to it. Okay, good luck.</text></string>
<string id="muller_mil_start_dialog_401"><text>Greetings, Marked One! How are you?</text></string>
<string id="tex_muller_outfit_article"><text>Mueller, mercenary from Army Warehouses, asks to get him a new black suit with gas mask. Promises various goodies of my choice as reward.</text></string>

<string id="bar_no_korovan_dialog_0"><text>About the caravan...</text></string>
<string id="bar_no_korovan_dialog_1"><text>Quiet! Everything should stay between us... What did you learn?</text></string>
<string id="bar_no_korovan_dialog_2"><text>Found your man, Mueller. But... He died.</text></string>
<string id="bar_no_korovan_dialog_3"><text>What about the caravan?</text></string>
<string id="bar_no_korovan_dialog_4"><text>Who knows? I did my job, what about our deal?</text></string>
<string id="bar_no_korovan_dialog_9"><text>Tooth keeps his word. But there's one thing. You found Mueller, yes. Dead. But while you were wandering somewhere, he managed to send me a message on PDA the day after our conversation, already dying. I'm extremely dissatisfied with your sluggishness, Marked One. We didn't discuss penalties, of course, but I think it'd be fair if you give me a second-level artifact. And in excellent condition, necessarily.</text></string>
<string id="bar_no_korovan_dialog_101"><text>You're quite the nerve... But I admit I could've acted faster. Here's the artifact.</text></string>
<string id="bar_no_korovan_dialog_102"><text>Hmm... Let's see.</text></string>
<string id="bar_no_korovan_dialog_51"><text>That's great. Everything's smooth on my end. You can go to the Valley. None of his boys will shoot at you before negotiations with Borov.</text></string>
<string id="bar_no_korovan_dialog_52"><text>They say something happened to Borov - he got whacked. But there's a guy who grabbed many of Borov's secrets.\nSeemed to be seen in the Gut. Rodent is his name.</text></string>

<string id="bar_no_korovan2_dialog_0"><text>I'm here about the meeting with Borov.</text></string>
<string id="bar_no_korovan2_dialog_1"><text>Brought a second-level artifact? Can't get around compensation here.</text></string>
<string id="bar_no_korovan2_dialog_11"><text>You're quite the nerve... But I admit I could've acted faster back then. Here's the artifact.</text></string>
<string id="bar_no_korovan2_dialog_12"><text>Compensation? You'll get your compensation.</text></string>

<string id="bar_korovan_dialog_1"><text>Quiet! Everything should stay between us... What did you learn?</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_dialog_2"><text>Of those escorting the caravan, only Mueller survived. He gave you a note... Here it is.</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_dialog_3"><text>Survived, you say? That's good... So, judging by the note, military attacked the caravan. They usually don't take cargo out of the Zone, afraid of radiation and other strange emissions. So most likely the cargo remained at the ambush site.</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_dialog_4"><text>Well, I did my job, what about our deal?</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_dialog_51"><text>Everything's in force, I talked to who I needed. You can go to the Valley. None of his boys will shoot at you before negotiations with Borov.\nMarked One, maybe we finish the caravan business? Check the ambush site, if the cargo's there, I'll send guys to haul everything out... So what do you say?</text></string>

But there's a guy who grabbed many of Borov's secrets.\nMarked One, maybe we finish the caravan business? Check the ambush site, if the cargo's there, I'll send guys to haul everything out... Then I'll give you a tip on this rat, plus something else I'll throw in, got something to give you... You won't regret it!</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_dialog_61"><text>What needs to be done?</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_dialog_62"><text>No, I have my own path, figure it out yourself.</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_dialog_7"><text>Check the crates at Agroprom, see if it's really our cargo. If everything's right, come back.</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_dialog_8"><text>Alright, deal.</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_dialog_9"><text>We'll figure it out, but you...</text></string>

<string id="bar_korovan_done_dialog_0"><text>Boy did I get in trouble with your caravan!</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_done_dialog_1"><text>What happened? No cargo?</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_done_dialog_2"><text>It's there! There's a chimera lair and radiation - holy hell!</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_done_dialog_31"><text>Don't whine... Thanks for the work. As reward I can offer either a recipe for a very rare artifact - called "Eye", or a container for 3 artifacts and ammo for the "VAL", won't hurt to have.</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_done_dialog_32"><text>Don't whine... Thanks for the work! Take some ammo from me, won't hurt to have, and a container for 3 artifacts. They say something happened to Borov - he got whacked. But there's a guy who grabbed many of Borov's secrets.\nSeemed to be seen in the Gut. Rodent is his name.</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_done_dialog_41"><text>Recipe is good, didn't run around for nothing.</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_done_dialog_42"><text>I'll take the container and ammo, might come in handy.</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_done_dialog_51"><text>Sent the recipe to your PDA - study it.</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_done_dialog_52"><text>Then take the container and ammo.</text></string>
<string id="bar_korovan_done_dialog_6"><text>Thank you. Be well...</text></string>

<string id="osvedomitel_yantar_way_dialog_0"><text>Need to get to Yantar...</text></string>
<string id="osvedomitel_yantar_way_dialog_1"><text>To Yantar? Well... What's your interest there?</text></string>
<string id="osvedomitel_yantar_way_dialog_11"><text>Yeah, already heard. Artifacts from you. Then I'll share information...</text></string>
<string id="osvedomitel_yantar_way_dialog_2"><text>Need to help someone. Only scientists know how it can be done...</text></string>
<string id="osvedomitel_yantar_way_dialog_3"><text>Well? Scientists... Between us girls, these nerds don't know anything! Trust me, I haven't heard anything good about them from any stalker yet. The places there are cursed, you better not go there. You'll be safer.</text></string>
<string id="osvedomitel_yantar_way_dialog_4"><text>Don't worry about me too much. Will you show the way?</text></string>
<string id="osvedomitel_yantar_way_dialog_5"><text>Ever heard the saying: "Knowledge is money"? No? Then I'll say it simpler - you get me four good ones, no less than second level artifacts, and I'll tell you how to pass so your guts stay with you.\nOh, look how you winced! Well, if you can't do four second-level - give me a couple third-level. Or just one, but from the dummies...</text></string>
<string id="osvedomitel_yantar_way_dialog_61"><text>If it weren't for... Alright. Here's four second-level.</text></string>
<string id="osvedomitel_yantar_way_dialog_62"><text>Two artifacts! Here, take them, robber.</text></string>
<string id="osvedomitel_yantar_way_dialog_63"><text>Here's a dummy, now talk.</text></string>
<string id="osvedomitel_yantar_way_dialog_64"><text>Don't have that many artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="osvedomitel_yantar_way_dialog_7"><text>Money is dust, good attitude is diamond! Remember that. Look here, you need to go a bit more to the left here - there's a "Bungee", the bastard, settled there, and here run without delay - some crap drips on your brain... Got it? Well, good luck...</text></string>

<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_101"><text>Stalker, help! We were flying to Yantar when mercenaries shot down our helicopter. Pilots and three of our colleagues died in the hard landing. Another was later shot by mercenaries. We're not fighters, we're scientists... What could we do?!</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_102"><text>Why did the mercenaries attack you?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_103"><text>We were researching the possibility of passage through Yantar to Radar. At Radar, rumor has it, there might be quite a lot of artifacts and possibly a direct path further to the reactor itself. The psi-emission intensity is non-uniform, and with enough observations it might be possible to create protection that would allow crossing terrain where deadly radiation operates.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_104"><text>So what's that to the mercenaries?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_105"><text>Apparently someone's eager to penetrate the center of the Zone and solve the mystery of the Monolith... if, of course, we assume it really exists. So they hire "soldiers of fortune" to capture all available information on this matter.\nSorry, I didn't introduce myself, Kruglov is my surname, and what should I call you?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_106"><text>Call me Marked One. I've heard something about the Monolith and the center of the Zone somewhere. What is it? Why is someone looking for information about it and why should you know anything about it? And what did you want from me?</text></string>

<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_152"><text>Mercenaries, you say? By any chance, not the ones by the trailer, behind the unfinished building, feeding snorks?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_153"><text>What? They're... dead? All of them?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_154"><text>How should I know, maybe someone ran away or hid. Why did they attack you at all?</text></string>

<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_160"><text>I rummaged around the mercenary camp a bit, but didn't come across any PDAs. Maybe someone really did run off and took your stuff with them.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_161"><text>Yeah... that's a real shame. So much time and effort wasted, ugh. Listen, Marked One, couldn't you then escort us to Yantar? You won't lose out, I promise!</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_1611"><text>Alright, it's on my way anyway. Show the route, I don't know this area well.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_1612"><text>No, Kruglov, sorry, I'm swamped with work, not going your way.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_1613"><text>Alright, go on then. We'll manage somehow, and Sakharov probably already alerted rescuers about our disappearance...</text></string>

<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, I see you're an experienced stalker, but you ask too many questions. If we get out of here, I'll definitely answer all of them, but not now. Our situation is screwed. How are we going to get to our camp at Yantar?! And the worst part is that our three months of work is lost - the mercenaries took all our PDAs.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_202"><text>That's putting it mildly. Let's get to business then.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_203"><text>I'm thinking: what if there's still a chance to get at least something back?! At least my PDA, that had the most valuable information. What if you could negotiate with the mercenaries or somehow force them otherwise?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2021"><text>Negotiate with mercenaries? Won't they just start shooting at me the moment they see me? Pretty risky. Why should I? And where to look for them now?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2025"><text>Let me try to escort you to Yantar instead.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2026"><text>Listen, Kruglov, your problems don't concern me...</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2031"><text>Don't worry! You won't lose out, I promise! I'll share useful information, and I have something more substantial saved for a rainy day, so to speak. As for "where to look" - I heard the mercenaries talking among themselves that they're planning to set up camp nearby, behind the unfinished building.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2035"><text>Huge thanks for that! But keep in mind: we're not fighters, we're useless in case of danger. And when we reach safety, I'll pay you fairly for the help, be sure of that.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2036"><text>Well, that's a shame. Let's hope Professor Sakharov sends rescuers to look for us.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2041"><text>Hell with it, here goes nothing! I'll try to negotiate.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2045"><text>Got it. In short, show the way, I don't know this area well.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2046"><text>Most certainly...</text></string>

<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_211"><text>Marked One, is that you? So, any news?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2121"><text>Boy did I run around for your data!</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2122"><text>I talked to their leader. Overall he agrees, but demands something in return.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2123"><text>In progress. Wait.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2127"><text>In short, it's a bust. The main mercenary kicked the bucket and your PDA wasn't on him.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2128"><text>About the mercenary leader's stash...</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_213"><text>Did it work? Do you have our PDAs? Come on, don't keep me in suspense!</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2141"><text>Their leader gave me this PDA, said it was yours. Here, take it, check it. I couldn't turn it on myself, by the way. Maybe the battery died?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2142"><text>Found the mercenaries' stash, and there were 3 broken PDAs and one whole one. Here, take it, check it. Is it yours? I couldn't turn it on myself, by the way. Maybe the battery died?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_21511"><text>Definitely mine. There's special blocking here, like insurance in case of loss. Though it seems the mercenaries figured out how to bypass it. Well, at least all the data is intact. Now I can contact Sakharov to send help. Huge human thanks to you, Marked One!\nSo look, here's where the safe road from Bar to Army Warehouses begins. When you get there, turn right immediately and go along the barbed wire. You'll see a small box under a tree. I hid an artifact and medical kits there - it's rightfully yours now.\nMmm... Ah! Alright! There's another place! Behind the factory at Yantar, look under the old excavator, I also stored some things for myself there. Hope they haven't been stolen yet. By the way! I recently learned a very interesting artifact transformation method from a colleague. Write down the recipe for obtaining the "Diamond Kolobok" hypermodificate!</text></string>

<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_236"><text>Wow, worthy! Well, thank you too!</text></string>

<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_21221"><text>What exactly?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2132"><text>Doesn't matter, I'll figure it out myself. Stay here, I'll try to be quick.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2135"><text>Here's the situation. Wolfhound - that's their leader's nickname - agrees to give back your PDA with data in exchange for an artifact called "Mama's beads". The question is where to find these "Beads".</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2145"><text>"Mama's beads"? I've heard of such an artifact. You can't find it in natural conditions, specific conditions are needed. As you stalkers say - a "recipe" is needed. I even had it written down somewhere, from our colleague - Docent Semyonov. But I don't know it by heart, sorry. Maybe try visiting Yantar, ask Semyonov himself?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2155"><text>In principle, that's possible...</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2165"><text>Oh yes, here's something else. While you were gone, a Duty patrol squad passed by, we talked with them, and they kindly agreed to call a rescue helicopter for us. I think they'll come for us soon. If by the time you finish business with the mercenaries we're not here, be sure to find us at the camp at Yantar.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2175"><text>Got it, noted.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2137"><text>Kicked the bucket? What bucket... Ah! He died? What happened?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_2138"><text>I'm listening carefully.</text></string>

<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_251"><text>Are you ready? Then let's go!</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_252"><text>Where did you disappear to, Marked One? We managed without you...</text></string>

<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_501"><text>Hello! Thanks for the help once again!</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_502"><text>Go your way, Marked One. We'll manage without your help somehow.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_dt_start_dialog_503"><text>Good to see you, Marked One!</text></string>

<string id="bar_ecologs_crush_start_dialog_101"><text>Stalker, talk to Kruglov, he's in charge here. There, in the green suit.</text></string>
<string id="bar_ecologs_crush_start_dialog_102"><text>Alright, I'll talk to him.</text></string>
<string id="bar_ecologs_crush_start_dialog_211"><text>Well, how's it progressing?</text></string>
<string id="bar_ecologs_crush_start_dialog_212"><text>In progress.</text></string>
<string id="bar_ecologs_crush_start_dialog_501"><text>Thanks for the help!</text></string>
<string id="bar_ecologs_crush_start_dialog_502"><text>What do you want, stalker?</text></string>
<string id="bar_ecologs_crush_start_dialog_503"><text>Yes?</text></string>

<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_0"><text>Remember, you said it yourself: try to negotiate with them or force them. So... consider that I tried.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_1"><text>Just tell me straight: what happened? Is he dead?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_2"><text>Kruglov, why are you so persistent, huh? Yes, the mercenary leader died suddenly, but I don't think you need the details.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_3"><text>Well, damn... and he definitely didn't have our PDAs? Did you search everything there thoroughly?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_4"><text>Didn't dig the ground with my nose - what's true is true, but I'm not completely green in such matters either. Searching and then stashing what's found - it's in stalkers' blood, heh-heh.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_5"><text>Hmm... what if their leader did the same? That is, simply made a stash nearby and hid our PDAs there? Marked One, I really ask you: walk around a bit more in the vicinity of their camp. You have a trained eye, you said so yourself...</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_6"><text>Damn... you're running me around like a rookie from the last draft.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_7"><text>We'll definitely find a way to compensate your time. By the way, I just remembered that their leader also had a palmtop... Didn't come across it? But that's for later. First look around once more thoroughly. Walk around there for at least an hour.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_8"><text>Alright, alright, I'm going...</text></string>

<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_2_0"><text>So I wandered around the area like you asked...</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_2_1"><text>That was quick. I asked you to spend at least an hour on it.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_2_11"><text>Uh... yes, you're right, I'll come back later.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_2_2"><text>And? Did you manage to find anything?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_2_21"><text>Looked under almost every bush - no stashes.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_2_22"><text>Nothing... Seems the mercenaries managed to sell your palmtops somewhere. Or maybe they found what they were looking for and just threw them into the first anomaly they came across. But I have their leader's PDA... Take a look.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_2_211"><text>Sad to hear that. Maybe you'd agree to escort us to Yantar one last time then? I'd share a worthwhile stash with you, otherwise there's nothing to give you, we're left with nothing, as you know. Unless Sakharov throws in something later...</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_2_221"><text>Interesting... Could he have copied something from our research? Eh, almost all sections are password-protected, will have to crack the security. Ha, no lock on transactions, though there's only ten of them here. Anyway, transferring everything to you. Maybe you'd agree to escort us to Yantar one last time, not for free of course?</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_2_212"><text>This stash better really be "worthwhile", let's go...</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_2_213"><text>Alright, enough, I've run around plenty "for free" already, farewell.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_2_222"><text>Possibly, in principle. Just show the way then, I don't know this area well. Let's move.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_volkodav_umer_2_223"><text>Nah, ran around enough already. No offense, Kruglov, but I'm not going your way from here.</text></string>

<string id="kruglov_way_1_end_dialog_101"><text>Listen, Marked One! There's plenty of "Burner" anomalies ahead, be careful. Our suits will protect us, but you'll turn to ash instantly... Use bolts.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_way_1_end_dialog_102"><text>Teach your wife to cook soup. Forward!</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_way_1_end_dialog_201"><text>Need to hurry, might bring some monster here.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_way_2_end_dialog_101"><text>Thank you, Marked One! We'll rest a bit and move on ourselves. The places here are already familiar. Drop by Yantar, we'll be glad to see you. I think Sakharov will want to thank you too. And here's something else, look: I set up a little stash here. Was saving some things for myself. Take them by right.</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_way_2_end_dialog_102"><text>Well, thank you too! Good luck to you!</text></string>
<string id="kruglov_way_2_end_dialog_201"><text>Hey there, friend Marked One.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="merc_dt_dialog_start_101"><text>Stop! Don't move. Who are ya? Whatcha need here?</text></string>
<string id="merc_dt_dialog_start_1021"><text>Easy, no foam. Got business with your boss.</text></string>
<string id="merc_dt_dialog_start_1022"><text>Easy, no foam... Just need to pass through.</text></string>
<string id="merc_dt_dialog_start_1031"><text>Cocky, eh? What's yer name? Why ya need our Wolfhound?</text></string>
<string id="merc_dt_dialog_start_1032"><text>Cocky, eh? What's yer name?</text></string>
<string id="merc_dt_dialog_start_1041"><text>I'm Marked One. I'll tell Wolfhound myself what I need.</text></string>
<string id="merc_dt_dialog_start_1042"><text>I'm Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="merc_dt_dialog_start_105"><text>Marked One ya say, who marked ya? Just a joke like that. Put away yer gun and come on.</text></string>
<string id="merc_dt_dialog_start_201"><text>Come on, come on. Put away yer gun and come on.</text></string>

<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_101"><text>So-o, a stalker showed up. You here on business or just looking for adventures for your ass?\nName!</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_102"><text>No need to yell, I'm not deaf. They call me Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_201"><text>Well then, Marked One, voice the reason I'm observing you here.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_2021"><text>Here's the deal. You guys shot down the scientists' helicopter, then shot someone on the ground, and most importantly - took all the data carriers with information these guys had been collecting for months. In all conscience, I think their work results should be returned, at least copies. Ideally - the PDA of a certain Professor Kruglov. Scientists, after all, risk their necks here daily for their research and that deserves respect.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_2022"><text>I'm looking for people who know something about Strelok or anyone from his group. Won't you help?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_2031"><text>You look here... I don't even know how to react to such a statement.\nI like this, Marked One. Not greedy, not cowardly, and you think of others. Let's make a deal: I basically completed the contract and already passed the needed data to the client. Can give back the PDA. But! As you understand, we're not a salvation army.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_2032"><text>Why should I care? We have our own task. Ask about your acquaintances from those who've been fooling around in the Zone for a long time.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_204"><text>Who would doubt it...</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_205"><text>Well, since you understand... I have an order for certain information from Agroprom Research Institute. But the military has settled there firmly. Try to scout the situation, I'm interested in patrol schemes.\nThere's a scheme - I'll return the egghead's PDA. Just keep in mind, we'll stay here at most one more day. Don't make it - your problems.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_206"><text>A scheme? There's a little soldier hiding in Agroprom swamp, could try to interrogate him. Though... it's a long trek: getting there through the Bar, then back, then try finding you guys.</text></string>
<!-- "dezertir_dead" переход к 2082 -->
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_207"><text>I know there's a shorter path. Rookies from the Institute base ran to Yantar: to call home and all that. At Yantar, communications work steadily. So find out about the short road from the eggheads. And from the soldier, besides the post scheme, ask about another possibility to penetrate the base quietly. There's information that from the Agroprom catacombs, you can get straight onto Institute territory. That's it, come on - legs in hands and run.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_2081"><text>Short path?! Then wait for me.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_2091"><text>If you don't make it by the deadline, you'll find us at Army Warehouses. Time's ticking.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_2082"><text>Can't it be done differently? I have bad feelings about this...</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_2092"><text>Bad feelings? We can do it differently - you bring me one artifact, and I return the PDA.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_210"><text>What artifact?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_211"><text>It's called "Mama's beads", ever heard of such? No?! Seems like you can get such an artifact if you throw regular "Mama's beads" and some other crap into an anomaly. I don't know the exact recipe. Try asking these sick ones you're standing up for. They should know.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_2121"><text>Agreed, I'll find out the recipe from Kruglov.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_2122"><text>I'll think about it. If anything, I'll come back later.</text></string>
<!-- "dezertir_dead" фразы не будет -->
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_2123"><text>Perhaps I'd better go to Agroprom after all.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_251"><text>Well, thinker, made up your mind?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_301"><text>Any news?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_401"><text>Marked One, wanted something else?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_451"><text>So-o, a stalker showed up. You here on business or just looking for adventures for your ass?\nWhat should I call you?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_452"><text>They call me Marked One. What's going on here?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_453"><text>Hmm. Marked One? I've heard about you. They say you have a mark on your hand? The one you got your nickname from? Can I take a look?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_501"><text>Hmm. Marked One, still alive? Didn't expect that. I heard you have a mark on your hand? The one you got your nickname from? Can I take a look?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_502"><text>Well, yeah. So what?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_503"><text>I signed up to complete a task here. And it might somehow concern a person with such a mark like yours. Shall we think it over?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_504"><text>A task? What relation does it have to me?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_505"><text>A task... well, alright. So, you've heard about Monolithians? You know, those psychos who got north and south mixed up in their heads. They've recently gotten new guns, unusual ones. Accuracy almost one hundred percent, lethality - don't even worry! Some corporations abroad would very much like to "catch the wave" and outdo competitors in terms of supplying similar weapons. But here's the paradox - the gun exists, kills - it kills, but you can't pick it up! Not even with any grippers. You try to pick it up, and it goes poof, just black smoke... So we're looking for at least some clue that would allow taking such weapons out of the Zone and disassemble them, so to speak, into spare parts. Understand the principle.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_506"><text>Still don't understand: what's this got to do with me?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_507"><text>Here's where what I can't understand myself comes up. There's information that Monolithians are looking for you. Well, maybe not you specifically, but someone who has such a mark on their hand. They have something important. You get it? If you're important to them, then maybe we can build our relationship on that basis?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_508"><text>My brain just exploded from your logic. What exactly do you want?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_509"><text>Closer to the so-called Brain Scorcher, a small group of Monolithians has settled. Regular Monolithians aren't particularly bright, they moo something, but shoot well, which is surprising. But they have a senior. You can establish contact with him. I've already met with him. No results so far, but he hinted that a person with such a mark might improve understanding. You feel it?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_510"><text>I feel that this business stinks badly. But if they might know something about this mark, then I need to see this Monolithian.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_511"><text>I knew you'd understand everything correctly. I suggest you meet with them, and then tell me what they want from you. You give me information, and I give you... a path from here to Red Forest.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_512"><text>Walk to Radar? Rumors say it's not sweet there, I'll think about it, I'm swamped with work here.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_601"><text>How are you? Everything alright? When are you heading beyond the Barrier?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_701"><text>How are you? Everything alright? Have you been to Radar already?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_702"><text>Yes, managed to communicate there, if you can call it communication.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_703"><text>Well? What did you find out?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_704"><text>Strange conversation. These "superhumans" moo like bulls, only one can talk, and even then like some robot...</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_705"><text>Who-who? Superhumans?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_706"><text>Well, that talkative one said they're supposedly superhumans. And looked at me like at some bug.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_707"><text>Let it be so. What did you talk about?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_708"><text>About practically nothing. If I understood correctly, they need someone marked with such a tattoo. But what exactly for... Seems they want the Brain Scorcher to be turned off. And what they get from this - hell knows.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_709"><text>Marked, you say. That's interesting, so it turns out you're not the only one like this. Though I haven't seen such a mark on anyone else. Well, let's suppose. Was there at least some hint about our business?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_710"><text>I didn't learn anything, I'm telling you! How can you learn when he cuts phrases like with an axe, you can only guess what he wants to say... As for me, you can understand him as if I can go somewhere they can't, and they desperately need to get there. And it's somewhere not here at all... Or you can understand that I can somehow get to the Scorcher and shut it down.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_711"><text>Well, that's already something. They need you, that's already good. If you can go somewhere there, then why can't you grab something there too, eh? You get it? But why they need to shut down the installation... Maybe if we turn off the Scorcher, they'll become more talkative?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_712"><text>Not sure. Says it interferes with their thinking and they can't go further somewhere because of it... Something like that.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_713"><text>Can't go further... hmm. Maybe it so happens that this Brain Scorcher isn't turned on against people, but against Monolithians. So it turns off, and where will these "superhumans" crawl? And why? On the other hand, this might be just the chance to pull them out from behind the Barrier. If Muhammad doesn't want to go to the mountain, then why not invite the mountain to visit him?</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_714"><text>Listen, I don't care about your plans for these Monolithians. I'm much more interested in how I'm connected to them? What's this tattoo got to do with it? Where can I get to and what's there? Why do they need this themselves? My head is swelling. It was already unclear, and now there are only more questions.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_715"><text>A fool gets rich with thought. Ever heard such a saying? Alright, alright, I'm joking. The main thing is that Monolithians need you, which means I wasn't wrong about you. And something needs to be decided about the Scorcher... Thanks for the information, and the crossing to Red Forest is to the right, beyond the gates, let me put a mark on your PDA. There, use it.\nThat's all for now. Maybe later there'll be more business, but not now.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_716"><text>Well alright... See you.</text></string>
<string id="volkodav_dt_dialog_start_801"><text>You? What will you tell me?</text></string>

<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept_0"><text>Greetings. I'm from Kruglov, about an artifact recipe.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept_1"><text>Who are you anyway? What recipe? I've tested many of them, most don't work of course, but there are quite interesting ones.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept_2"><text>I'm Marked One. Kruglov said you know the recipe for getting the "Mama's beads" artifact.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept_3"><text>"Mama's beads"? Yes, I tested a method for obtaining this artifact. Unfortunately, I've only managed to synthesize it once so far. The problem is in very rarely encountered ingredients. One component of this recipe is especially scarce - an electrochimera kidney. This organ, as our research showed, is responsible for generating the electric field around this creature. A friend got one for me from hunters in the Gut for big money.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept_4"><text>Just tell me the recipe, and I'll find an electrochimera somewhere. I'll go to those same hunters, after all.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept_5"><text>Hmm, let's do this: bring the kidney, and I'll give you the recipe!</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept_61"><text>Oh you professors! Agreed, I'll bring you this organ.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept_62"><text>Holy cow! It's not for me! I wanted to help Kruglov!</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept_7"><text>What do I care about Kruglov? He has his work, I have mine. Don't want to help me, then don't expect help from me.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept_81"><text>You live so harmoniously... Really envious... Agreed.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept_82"><text>Go to hell! I'm sick of everything! Figure it out yourselves!</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept_83"><text>I'll think about it.</text></string>

<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept1_0"><text>Listen, about the "Mama's beads"...</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept1_1"><text>So, decided?</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept1_21"><text>Yes, I agree. I'll drag you the damned electrochimera kidney.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept1_22"><text>Decided! To hell with your complications!</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept1_23"><text>If I find the kidney, then we'll see.</text></string>

<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept2_0"><text>Hey there, Semyonov! Found an electrochimera kidney!</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept2_1"><text>Electrochimera? Ah! ElectroChimera! I'll have to remember... Don't keep me waiting, give it here.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept2_21"><text>Take it. Careful, sometimes it shocks... Hard.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept2_22"><text>Where is it? I lost it.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept2_3"><text>I know, got shocked myself a couple times - brain almost leaked out. Write down the recipe: to obtain anomalously transformed matter requires...</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept2_4"><text>Listen, make it shorter. Without your scientific showing off.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept2_5"><text>As you wish. Throw into a "Snow" anomaly: electrochimera kidney, "Mama's beads", burer paw and bloodsucker tentacle. In 10 minutes you'll have "Mama's beads". Oh yes, one more thing... I think it'll be useful for you to know.\nA stalker came by the other day, he claimed he saw an electrochimera at Wild Territory, somewhere around the collapsed tunnel. And our colleagues from the field expedition repeatedly observed burers in the area stalkers call "the Gut" for some reason. There's a damaged overpass there, they often spot them near it. What only attracts them there?!\nAs for the required artifact, if you don't know where to get it, I'd ask around at the Bar if I were you. I heard rumors that there's often a guy there who exchanges some artifacts for others. Contact him.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_flash_resiept2_6"><text>Noted! And thanks for the tips. See ya, science.</text></string>

At least ask him about me. I, by the way, contracted to help him with a problem... I'm telling you, I'll probably be useful to you guys too.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_way_agro_5"><text>Really? If that's so, then... Alright, it's not such a secret path. I'll mark the crossing coordinates in your PDA. Use it in good health.</text></string>
<string id="yan_semenov_way_agro_6"><text>I'll owe you.</text></string>

<string id="yan_klyk_med1_0"><text>Excuse me, do you remember Fang?</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med1_1"><text>Fang? Ah, the one who used to go with that, what's his name, Phantom?... No. Ah! Ghost! He always went with him? I remember. But he died... Long ago. Why are you interested in them?</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med1_2"><text>Actually, he's alive. I met him recently in the underground, at Agroprom. Unfortunately, he's badly crippled, and most importantly, his brain is severely damaged. Consequence of zombification.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med1_3"><text>You mean to say: after zombification someone was able to regain consciousness? Incredible! Listen, my dear fellow, we absolutely must examine our acquaintance! Bring him here, we'll take care of him, and reward you materially...</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med1_31"><text>Why? I didn't ask. I want to help.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med1_32"><text>Exactly for the help, the contribution, so to speak, to science. I'll definitely pick something worthy for you.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med1_4"><text>Whatever... That's not the main thing. The problem is, professor, that Fang can't come to the surface. As soon as he approaches the exit from the underground, he becomes a zombie again.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med1_5"><text>Can't? Apparently residual psi-emission is acting. I think a properly tuned protective device might help, something like a helmet. Main thing is to tune it right, otherwise the protection can be breached.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med1_6"><text>Tune? How?</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med1_7"><text>Need a recording of psi-field meter readings at triangulation points of intensity along the route. As you understand, triangulation requires at least two, and even better three measurement locations. All this, of course, could be done much more accurately and quickly with the new device we recently received, but our new device disappeared somewhere. Someone's unforgivable carelessness, a completely new and very expensive device! We'll have to use what we have...\nYou say at Agroprom? So, let me mark the necessary measurement points... Here, here and here, clear? Take the device from Docent Semyonov. To accurately measure psi, you need to place the device at the indicated point and wait five to ten minutes while the meter filters parasitic interference and isolates the useful signal. When you measure at all points, bring the device, and I'll tune the protective helmet based on its readings.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med1_8"><text>Clear, I'll do just that. One more question? Fang spoke about Ghost. Tell me about him, you communicated with him?</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med1_9"><text>What to tell... not much to say really. He visited here repeatedly, I even gave him some tasks. I liked working with him, very nimble stalker, could get anywhere. Brought such curious specimens that no one had seen before. But by and large I was more interested in research results. Colleague Vasilyev had closer relations with him. I think he was trying to find proof for his theory... Recently Vasilyev and Ghost were here, as if they started another of their "explorations"... Well, that's probably all.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med1_10"><text>Thanks even for that.</text></string>
<string id="tex_klyk_med_article"><text>Professor Sakharov promised to tune a special protective helmet with which Fang can leave his refuge in the Agroprom Research Institute underground. But first I need to take psi-field measurements at three surface points, they're marked in my PDA.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_0"><text>I'm here about the PDA recording, from the swamp. It appears to be Vasilyev's PDA.</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_1"><text>Oh, what a pity, so the monsters got to him. What a terrible death.</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_2"><text>I don't think monsters devoured the body. I found an intact jumpsuit, completely zipped up. It seems like the clothes are there, but the body... When I was examining it something strange happened. Some red flash and... nothing, no body, no jumpsuit, just things. Monsters wouldn't be able to get to the body without tearing the jumpsuit to shreds. But I listened to the recording, and I'm interested in one moment. It seemed to me that Vasilyev said: "Sakharov is a coward, doesn't answer!!!", you heard the recording. Can you comment somehow?</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_3"><text>I don't know, he was shooting back and could have said it in the heat of the moment. We argued once, he kept wanting to test his theory, and I told him it was dangerous to go without reliable protection. He probably meant that. There were no messages from him, believe me. I'll try to do everything possible to find out his fate. Won't you give me this device? There might be some scientific data there, because of which this promising scientist died.</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_4"><text>I thought: if Vasilyev penetrated X-16 and got out to the swamp, then how? You heard the recording: he came out through some tunnels. Maybe it's easier to find these tunnels and enter from there?</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_5"><text>Hmm... what we heard in the recording, the information is unreliable to put it mildly... Take at least his statement about me... And then... why do you think he came out in a different place, and not where he went in? Why do you think he was specifically in X-16, and not in some basement? After all, these are only his words, there's no confirmation. Finally, why are you so sure he was there at all? Perhaps he was under the influence of radiation and all this was his... uh... hallucinations. I already said I was quite skeptical about Vasilyev's venture.</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_6"><text>You're probably right. Better to look for the entrance after all.</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_7"><text>So will you give me this PDA? There might be important scientific data there.</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_8"><text>Important, you say... And how much might such data cost?</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_9"><text>Oh these stalkers! Always profit and loot... I can offer you a quite rare artifact specimen... Artifacts with similar properties, believe me, are extremely rare. Yes, Vasilyev, before making his insane act, was interested in similar artifacts. If not, then a hundred buckshot rounds would be just right. So, what do you say?</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_91"><text>Alright, give me your artifact.</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_92"><text>I'll take the ammo instead.</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_93"><text>First, I'll try to find the information I need in this PDA myself.</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_101"><text>That's a worthy act. Here's an artifact and some medical supplies.</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_102"><text>That's a worthy act. Here's ammo and some medical supplies.</text></string>
<string id="yan_vasilyev_search_103"><text>Well, that's your right... If something interesting turns up, please - let us know.</text></string>

<string id="yan_klyk_med2_0"><text>Semyonov, I need the device.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med2_11"><text>For psi-field measurement? I already gave it to you, forgot? Still haven't returned it to inventory, can't help.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med2_12"><text>What device? I don't have freebies. Go ask Sakharov.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med2_21"><text>Right, I took it for measurements here at Yantar. Need to finish this business first.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med2_22"><text>Sakharov sent me to you: go, he says, to the docent, to Semyonov, take the psi measurement device from him...</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med2_3"><text>Well, should've said so right away. Here's this device, take it. At least won't have to drag it around anymore.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med2_4"><text>I'll return it soon...</text></string>

<string id="agr_klyk_med_spot3"><text>Psi-field measurement point at Agroprom</text></string>
<string id="item_decoder2_name"><text>Psi-emission meter</text></string>
<string id="item_decoder2_desc"><text>This device allows measuring the intensity coefficient of the psionic component of anomalous radiation at a selected point.</text></string>
<string id="item_marsh_pribor_name"><text>Event recorder</text></string>
<string id="item_marsh_pribor_desc"><text>The device allows recording events in a limited area and saving data to memory. This data is needed by a scientist from Swamp.</text></string>

<string id="yan_klyk_med3_0"><text>Professor, I made the necessary measurements.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med3_1"><text>I beg your pardon?</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med3_2"><text>Well... You said I needed to take measurements with the device at Agroprom to tune the protective helmet for Fang.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med3_3"><text>Ah, yes! Sorry, my head is occupied with another problem. So, where are the measurements?</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med3_4"><text>Here's the measuring device, probably the measurements are in memory.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med3_42"><text>Uh... in the device, probably... Where did I put it...</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med3_5"><text>Yes, yes, I meant the device. So, let me check what we got, and you come back in a couple hours, we'll talk about the helmet...</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med3_6"><text>In a couple hours? Well alright...</text></string>

<string id="yan_klyk_med4_0"><text>I'm here about the helmet for Fang...</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_11"><text>Ah, Marked One... We processed the results of your measurements. Honestly, didn't expect... The intensity of psychotropic radiation depends non-linearly on distance from the Zone's center! If we extrapolate the data from these measurements...</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_12"><text>We haven't processed the measurement results yet, Marked One. Wait!</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_6"><text>Yes, yes, of course, I'll wait...</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_2"><text>Sorry, professor. Can I just get the helmet?</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_3"><text>What? Ah, yes... Sorry, sometimes I get carried away. Here's the tuned helmet. Put it on the test subj... I mean, let Fang put it on and come to the surface. There's a field near the Research Institute, I'll see the signal from the helmet and call a helicopter, and it'll transport our acquaintance directly here... Oh yes, by the way, Marked One, I ask you - don't loiter there. Pilots don't like stalkers, might not take Fang if he's not alone...</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_31"><text>But what then? Do you even have medics here? I mean specialists who could "fix" Fang's head... or restore memory, maybe...</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_32"><text>Of course, we don't have medics here, let alone such narrow specialists. Each of us underwent certain training in providing first aid, as well as help with poisoning, bites... But if it's a serious case, we immediately call a helicopter and send the victim to the mainland. Perhaps we can arrange Fang's transportation too. What wonderful material!</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_321"><text>What?</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_322"><text>What?</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_323"><text>Well you said something about material...</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_324"><text>Did I? I misspoke, so much in my head.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_33"><text>Hmm... Are there any specialist medics somewhere in the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_34"><text>Unlikely. And why? It's easier to call a helicopter. But if you're interested, ask at Swamp, there are biologists there, they're also kind of... connected to medicine, partially... Alright. Go to Fang and don't forget what I told you.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_4"><text>Alright, I understand. I'll sit it out in the underground.</text></string>
<string id="yan_klyk_med4_5"><text>Yes, yes, exactly sit it out. You're constantly at risk anyway...</text></string>

<string id="amk_metka_sidor_0"><text>What's this GPS beacon you're selling? And I saw some microchips on the counter or what are those anyway?</text></string>
<string id="amk_metka_sidor_1"><text>Beacons? Most convenient thing. I get them from Sakharov. Suppose you stashed something in one cache, another, a third. Hard to remember all places and contents. But this way, you put a beacon in the stash, and it transmits its location on the map to your PDA, along with a list of loot. As for "microchips", as you called them, these are special PDA expansion modules. As you can easily guess, they serve to add new functions to your palmtop. The module I have for sale is used to connect PDA with other devices. With it, for example, you can display Geiger counter readings directly on your handheld screen.</text></string>
<string id="amk_metka_sidor_2"><text>Curious. How far progress has come! Probably really useful gadgets.</text></string>
<string id="amk_metka_sidor_3"><text>You bet! Buy up while they're in stock. Demand is high. Start haggling - they'll be snatched up.</text></string>

<string id="black_tip_barman_0"><text>Something strange happened to me, won't you help figure it out?</text></string>
<string id="black_tip_barman_1"><text>Strangeness? Our whole life is strangeness. And the Zone... Anyway, be more specific.</text></string>
<string id="black_tip_barman_2"><text>Some time ago I found an unknown artifact in my backpack, and don't remember ever picking it up. I try to throw it away, but soon it somehow quietly ends up back in the backpack. Also, my health has sharply deteriorated recently, and timing-wise it coincided with this thing's appearance. Though maybe it's not connected, not sure.</text></string>
<string id="black_tip_barman_3"><text>Ah! That's what it is. I've heard about this... "Black mark" it's called. Chances of survival for whoever gets it are practically zero. Sorry to be so blunt, but you better be prepared...</text></string>
<string id="black_tip_barman_4"><text>What is this curse and where did it come from? I definitely remember not picking up such an artifact, never even saw it before.</text></string>
<string id="black_tip_barman_5"><text>That's what everyone says. There's an opinion that "Black mark" isn't quite an artifact. Rather, a parasite artifact.\nIt can pretend to be any item just to get picked up. And then, once it settles on a new host, that's when it manifests.</text></string>
<string id="black_tip_barman_6"><text>"Great" news... You said chances of survival are practically zero, but something can still be tried, as I understand?</text></string>
<string id="black_tip_barman_7"><text>Seems so. Ask experienced stalkers, like Bes or Grey. Maybe one of them knows how to get rid of this crap. Ah! Or at least get Brom. Know Brom? Often here. He, for example, was babbling about this topic once, but not sure if it was relevant. This drunk will soon completely drink away the rest of his brains.\nMeanwhile, I advise carrying more medkits and food. Good luck!</text></string>

<string id="tresure_need_barman_0"><text>Listen, friend, I'd like to store some loot...</text></string>
<string id="tresure_need_barman_1"><text>No, that's not for me. I've got a thoroughfare here, as you can see! Can't watch everyone... They steal something, then try to prove you're not a camel. You better go to Voronin, the Duty commander. He has discipline and your valuables will be safer.</text></string>
<string id="tresure_need_barman_2"><text>To Voronin? I'll try, but still, shame you can't...</text></string>
<string id="tresure_need_barman_3"><text>Everyone and their brother pounds on my door, and someone else's soul, you understand, is in darkness... So there's no guarantee whatsoever.</text></string>

<string id="tex_borov_11_saharov"><text>Sakharov is interested in information from the helicopter crash site in Dark Valley</text></string>
<string id="borov_11_saharov_0"><text>Professor, I found something near the crashed helicopter.</text></string>
<string id="borov_11_saharov_1"><text>In Dark Valley? Our functioning sensors showed us there was a person near the helicopter... So that was you? Well then, tell me what was there, and... how did they die?</text></string>
<string id="borov_11_saharov_2"><text>What happened there, I don't know. According to those who saw the helicopter fall, it was flying from the Zone's center already damaged - smoke was coming from the engine... Pilots died immediately, and two in ecologist suits managed to get out, but... There was a chimera lair there. So you understand...</text></string>
<string id="borov_11_saharov_3"><text>Yes... Spawn of the Zone... The more we learn, the more mysteries are revealed to us. Did you manage to find anything? Something that could shed light on their work?</text></string>
<string id="borov_11_saharov_4"><text>Here, just a container with some artifact, and documents...</text></string>
<string id="borov_11_saharov_41"><text>I found documents from one of the scientists. Here. There was something else, but...</text></string>
<string id="borov_11_saharov_42"><text>Container and documents, but... I don't have them with me now.</text></string>
<string id="borov_11_saharov_52"><text>Pity... Really hope you'll manage to bring them later.</text></string>
<string id="borov_11_saharov_5"><text>Thank you, thank you... So... Materials on research of an artifact having different phases! The container holds a sample. Very interesting! A series of additional experiments is needed!\nUnfortunately, we can't reward you with something material, we're only supplied with the most necessary equipment, but... We can help you with artifact transformation.\nAnd also... I had a new, untested anomaly detector somewhere here... Ah here it is! Please take it.</text></string>
<string id="borov_11_saharov_51"><text>Thank you... So... Materials on research of an artifact having different phases! The sample was placed in a highest level protection container! So-so...

Double-protected lock... I'll fiddle with it of course, maybe pick the key. Take a walk meanwhile. Come back in a couple hours, maybe something will become clear. And... Uh... Prepare... an artifact capsule. For, so to speak, compensation for time spent and silence about your transgressions.</text></string>

<string id="semenov_water_dialog_11"><text>You remember - regular water in exchange for firewater.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_water_dialog_12"><text>You helped me, so... in the sleeping quarters - there's some in the kettle.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_water_dialog_2"><text>At least something free.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_water_dialog_21"><text>Don't become a drunk. Here's a bottle.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_water_dialog_22"><text>Drank it all myself.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_water_dialog_3"><text>Look in the sleeping quarters - there should still be some in the kettle.</text></string>

<string id="mil_cook_water_dialog_0"><text>Got water? Need to wash up.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_water_dialog_1"><text>What? Water... Hungover, or what? Me too... always. Give me a bottle and you'll get water.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_water_dialog_21"><text>You're not a cook, you're a bloodsucker! Take it... How much fits in you.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_water_dialog_22"><text>What prices you have... I'll manage.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_water_dialog_3"><text>Yeah, that's me. How else? Nobody wants to work. Go look in the kitchen, it's running from the tap. Just close the faucet after yourself, or it'll all flow out, nobody to carry it.</text></string>

<string id="mil_skrjaga_water_dialog_0"><text>How about some water? Got any?</text></string>
<string id="mil_skrjaga_water_dialog_11"><text>Water? Is this for cleaning? Maybe there is some, but will you find something to pay with?</text></string>
<string id="mil_skrjaga_water_dialog_12"><text>Nah, none left, finished... Need to bring some. If you really need it, go to the Cook, maybe he has some.</text></string>
<string id="mil_skrjaga_water_dialog_21"><text>Man! Your rates. Alright, take it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_skrjaga_water_dialog_22"><text>What prices you guys have... I'll manage.</text></string>
<string id="mil_skrjaga_water_dialog_23"><text>To the Cook? I'll go.</text></string>
<string id="mil_skrjaga_water_dialog_3"><text>Well it's the Zone, brother, here only jerboa are born for free. There in the next room in the kettle there's still water, fill up.</text></string>

<string id="red_forest_lesnik_water_dialog_0"><text>How about some clean water? Got any?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_water_dialog_1"><text>Yeah, there's still a little. Went to the woods, collected some. There are a couple sacred springs. They give water. But, you understand, - going to the forest is troublesome business. Expensive on supplies. So - give me a couple ten rounds for shotgun or Kalash - and we'll deal.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_water_dialog_21"><text>No problem, here's for shotgun.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_water_dialog_22"><text>Got some spare for AK-74, here.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_water_dialog_23"><text>Got 7.62, for old Kalash.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_water_dialog_24"><text>I'll manage for now. Thanks for the offer.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_water_dialog_3"><text>That's good! Go downstairs - fill up from the washbasin there. Everything like normal people, civilized...</text></string>

<string id="lim_vovan_water_dialog_0"><text>Got water? To fill the canteen.</text></string>
<string id="lim_vovan_water_dialog_11"><text>Have it now, don't have it later. It's that kind of business. Someone gets clean water, someone pays for it. Get it? Want to fill a canteen with water, give me a medkit or anti-rad.</text></string>
<string id="lim_vovan_water_dialog_12"><text>Drank it all, drought's crushing everyone. Were remembering the boys.</text></string>
<string id="lim_vovan_water_dialog_21"><text>Only got a basic medkit.</text></string>
<string id="lim_vovan_water_dialog_22"><text>Got a military one, take it.</text></string>
<string id="lim_vovan_water_dialog_23"><text>Scientific one should work I think...</text></string>
<string id="lim_vovan_water_dialog_24"><text>Take the anti-rad, I got some.</text></string>
<string id="lim_vovan_water_dialog_25"><text>We're not in medical supplies nowadays...</text></string>
<string id="lim_vovan_water_dialog_3"><text>Alright, pour from the kettle there. And don't splash too much. It's not free.</text></string>
<string id="lim_vovan_water_dialog_4"><text>You might as well suggest "brilliant green". Keep it for yourself.</text></string>

<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_0"><text>So, Nut... Still sittin' around...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_1"><text>Ah! It's you, little bro. I see, I see - brought my little gun.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_21"><text>Don't reach out, first the info, where'd you see Fang?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_22"><text>Don't reach out, I found Fang without you. So, you understand...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_31"><text>Eh-m... That was long ago, last year even. Fang was lookin' for some parts then, and I had some after the last gig... Anyway, had some stuff. I helped him for small change... He gifted me this gun. I was hoppin' around the Valley then, used to gather evenings at the Bar with Freedomers - that was before they got kicked out from there... Listen, I'll tell ya like my own boy, there's a path to the Valley here, only ours go there. Let's do this: you return my gun, and I show you that road. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_32"><text>Come on, what're you... I get it, ain't stupid. Just ain't got money nowadays... Listen, I'll tell ya like my own boy, there's a path to the Valley here, only ours go there. Let's do this: you return my gun, and I show you that road. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_4"><text>Nut, didn't you get it? I paid artifacts for your gun, had to throw in extra on top. Why would I need that road? So your buddies on the other side would whack me?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_5"><text>Look at that, hole in the head but still thinks... Then, so you'd have reason to visit there, I'll give ya a tip on one little box. I hid some good stuff in it, long time ago though.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_61"><text>What to do with you, take the gun.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_62"><text>Payment's so-so. I'll keep the gun.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_71"><text>Deal! So look: here in the woods there's a passage, but be careful, lots of anomalies there, and all kinds of beasts. And here, in the wasteland, under a bush, my stash.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_72"><text>You're wrong, Marked One. Could've done some more business.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_8"><text>I'll look, but if there's nothing there, I'll be back.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_5_9"><text>Don't worry. And also... When you get to the Valley, turn right. There, at the old pig farm, Raven's crew settled down. Serious guys, not simple stalkers. Our brothers don't show their noses there without business, they're cautious. The guy's shady but you can do business with him, if you're smart and don't show off. Drop by, have a chat... And, uh, if we meet again, there'll be another topic for you.</text></string>

<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_6_0"><text>What'd you decide, Nut? That gun's pretty good.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_6_1"><text>Listen, Marked One, don't mess with my brains. Stop rubbing dry soap on my belly. I'm tellin' ya about the secret path to Dark Valley and another stash, hidden for myself... And you return my gun. If it don't suit ya, then get lost. I ain't in the mood today.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_6_21"><text>Alright, show me. I'm in a good mood today...</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_6_22"><text>Bottom line, no decent payment - no gun!</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_6_3"><text>Deal! So look: here in the woods there's a passage, but watch out, lots of anomalies there, and all kinds of beasts. And here's my little stash... And, uh, if we meet again, there'll be another topic for you.</text></string>

<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_7_4"><text>Watch it, Nut, no tricks.</text></string>

<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_0"><text>Listen, sicko, spill it, what's the deal with Ghost! Got a couple hides from mature flesh.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_1"><text>What? What do I need those for? A-a-ah... Japanese god! Hungover, thinkin' slow. I wanted to order new threads from Stepanych.\nDamn... Memory's completely gone. Well, here's the info. Like - till death and all that... Go on.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_2"><text>Put away the bullshit. You promised to tell about Ghost and his secret. I'm listening.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_31"><text>Who promised? Me? Ah! So we agreed that you'd also bring an artifact, and it shouldn't be fake. Got one like that?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_32"><text>Who promised? Me? Ah! Well... That's a fact. The other day I was shootin' the breeze with one guy about our sorrowful business, and he spilled that he's got a tip on Ghost's place, but it's too scary to take alone. Well and... Don't hold back on the hides, I would've told ya anyway, but... It's better this way.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_33"><text>Who promised? Me? You, uh, little bro... don't be offended. Head's really like cast iron from the hangover. Vodka's all fake, damn it. Pour some moonshine for clarity in the brains, like we agreed. You brought it, right?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_411"><text>Here's your hides and artifact! Talk!</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_412"><text>Don't get ahead of yourself... I'll think more about the artifact.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_421"><text>Better? Here's your skins. Well?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_422"><text>You're being shady. Think about it.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_431"><text>Will it really clear up? Then take the whole jar, excellent first-rate stuff. And if this don't help, I can treat ya with the rifle butt.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_432"><text>Moonshine for him, you understand... I didn't have time. Wait, maybe I'll bring some.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_51"><text>Oh! You! Can do it! Everything straight up: So basically, in early spring one of our pals grabbed some dude for a gig. Chatter-chatter, this and that and all that other stuff. The dude, turns out, was stealin' from one authority. Exactly from that same Ghost!</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_52"><text>What kinda skins... slimy. Really from flesh? Alright. You scratch my back - I scratch yours. One pal was runnin' his mouth that he knows where Ghost's place is with rich loot. Like he found a corpse in early spring, and there was a note on him from this same Ghost to one of his buddies. It was written there where and with what supplies he set up a stash. You dig?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_53"><text>Come on, what're you startin'? Well, a guy had too much, happens to everyone! Or are you an ulcer patient? By the way, maybe we should have a drink right now?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_61"><text>And then what?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_62"><text>I dig, I'm not stupid. Get to the point.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_63"><text>I'm starting to lose patience. Talk already!</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_71"><text>Huh? What-what... You made me lose my train of thought... Anyway! Ghost set up a place in the District Center and stored supplies there to make a run for Pripyat itself. You get it? District Center's way over there, so me and my buddies didn't bother making the trek. But for you, for your deeds, I'll spill, no question.\nOn the attic of a private house the loot's stashed, in a backpack. There's also workers' wagons on wheels abandoned nearby.\nIf you score big cash from this tip, don't forget about Nut, yeah?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_72"><text>Don't rush me, you're just making me lose my train of thought.\nAnyway, talk to my buddy yourself! Crowbar's his handle. Debt collectors, as I heard, nabbed him.\nThough there's people who'll vouch for him, so maybe he's already out of the slammer... Ask him about that case yourself in general.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_73"><text>Why you so nervous? Don't boil over, I'm being respectful! So basically, back in early spring I found this corpse. Like this dude was carrying a note from Ghost to his buddy. Well, blah-blah, Ghost described his stash in the District Center. Lots of supplies he supposedly prepared there to head to Pripyat. But where exactly - I didn't get. While I was figuring out what was scribbled there, blind dogs came, so I made tracks.\nOne thing I remembered - need to look for this loot in one of the apartments on the second floor of a half-destroyed Khrushchev building, facing Ilyich Square.\nIf you score big cash from this tip, don't forget about Nut, yeah?</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_81"><text>Hmm... that's far. Alright, I'll check it out when I get the chance. Maybe it's really something worthwhile.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_82"><text>I knew it wouldn't end with just hides. Crowbar, you're saying... I'll remember that.</text></string>
<string id="gar_dm_bandits_dialog_8_83"><text>Hmm... that's far. Alright, I'll check it out when I get the chance. Later, boozer.</text></string>

<string id="tex_minigame_bandit"><text>Rules for playing Blackjack:\nYou need to get eleven or as close to it as possible.</text></string>

<string id="val_mongol_dialog_start_101"><text>Hey there, little bro. Lookin' for something?</text></string>
<string id="val_mongol_dialog_start_102"><text>I see you made it. Alive? What're you doing here?</text></string>
<string id="val_mongol_dialog_start_103"><text>Yeah, alive. Entertainin' the crew and not forgettin' myself. For not being a scumbag, not leavin' me to die... Write down this recipe. One fly-by-night kid got busted during surrender, and the luck fell to me. Use it.</text></string>
<string id="val_mongol_dialog_start_201"><text>Hey there, well - how's it goin'? Little by little? Me too...</text></string>

<string id="minigame_start_dialog_bandit_0"><text>So how do you entertain the people?</text></string>
<string id="minigame_start_dialog_bandit_1"><text>Well, how else... It's tough here with normal fun. So, sometimes we'll shoot the breeze, sometimes play blackjack...</text></string>
<string id="minigame_start_dialog_bandit_2"><text>Blackjack? Cards?</text></string>
<string id="minigame_start_dialog_bandit_3"><text>Nah, not cards. Dice. Though the rules are the same... I throw one die, first for you. Until you say you've had enough. Then for myself. Eleven is blackjack - a win, more than eleven is a bust - a loss. That's how it goes.</text></string>

<string id="minigame_dialog_bandit_0"><text>Let's play. What're the stakes?</text></string>
<string id="minigame_dialog_bandit_1"><text>Food from you, cash from me. Against one loaf - five hundred, sausage - a grand, canned food - two grand!

<string id="mil_minigamer_dialog_start_1524"><text>Take the "Droplet" artifact, I'll try...</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigamer_dialog_start_1525"><text>Take the "Sparkler", I'm risking it...</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigamer_dialog_start_1526"><text>Got some useless "Slime", I'll try to risk it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigamer_dialog_start_1527"><text>I'll risk it... Take the "Thorn".</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigamer_dialog_start_153"><text>Respect! Go on then... Loot's in one of the three...</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigamer_dialog_start_154"><text>Ha! You went for it!</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_dialog_door_0"><text>Listen, Pavlo! What's that door, armored?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_dialog_door_1"><text>Hell knows... Seems to lead somewhere into the catacombs. Our guys didn't open it - Lukash wouldn't let them. We take turns guarding here, watching so no kind of evil crawls out... And from time to time something bangs, knocks from inside... And howls! Gives you the creeps sometimes... Especially at night...</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_dialog_door_2"><text>And Lukash, what? Does he know something? Why did he forbid opening it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_dialog_door_3"><text>Go ask him if you're interested. I think to myself, if there's a head who makes decisions, then he knows. And I don't pry with questions about why and what for... Those who doubted the correctness of Lukash's orders, they don't doubt anything anymore, their bones lie around the Zone, white, clean...</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_dialog_door_4"><text>Ye-e-es... The less you know - the better you sleep... Later... Philosopher.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_door_dialog_0"><text>I have a question. About the armored door in the tunnel.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_door_dialog_1"><text>What's it to you? Door's a door... Protects our base, you could say - our home, from all kinds of unknown creatures...</text></string>
<string id="lukash_door_dialog_2"><text>Where does it lead? Maybe there's something special there?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_door_dialog_3"><text>Where? To the underground... There's tons of monsters and other horrors! I haven't been there myself and I don't advise you to go! The soldiers blocked it for good reason! If it were up to me, I'd blow the whole damn remainder of this tunnel to hell, so you couldn't even see this door!</text></string>
<string id="lukash_door_dialog_4"><text>Who can object to you? Go blow it up!</text></string>
<string id="lukash_door_dialog_5"><text>It's not that simple, guy. Some special services have some interest here. And their representative spoke quite directly: we're only tolerated here as guards of this very passage... That's how things are... So, get it out of your head and do something useful: bloodsuckers appeared in the village again!</text></string>
<string id="lukash_door_dialog_6"><text>Wait up! What kind of representative? Where can I find him? Maybe he knows something?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_door_dialog_7"><text>Marked One! Nobody told you that you're stubborn as a mule!\nAlright!\nYou got to me!\nThere's constantly one person in the Bar - everyone calls him Prapor... Though he's actually high-ranking. Talk to him. If he wants - he'll tell you.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_door_dialog_8"><text>Prapor... Got it... Well, see you later.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_dialog_max_0"><text>Where can I have some normal fun?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_dialog_max_1"><text>Go out to the bloodsucker village at night in your underwear... That's where the fun will begin...</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_dialog_max_2"><text>Ha-ha-ha... Very funny... It's boring with you guys...</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_dialog_max_3"><text>Go see Pavlo... He really loves to entertain those who are bored...</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_dialog_max_4"><text>Who's that? Where to find him?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_dialog_max_5"><text>Gambler... Fun guy... You'll find him in the northeast corner of the base, near the collapsed tunnel...</text></string>
<string id="minigame_treasure"><text>Check backpack</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_dialog_0"><text>I heard your guys fall from the sky?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_dialog_1"><text>You mean that fool? Yeah, quite a story... As I was told, appeared right out of nowhere, from thin air. Naked, muttering something like: "Ghost, ghost... wait, ghost...".</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_dialog_2"><text>Who is it? Didn't you recognize him?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_dialog_3"><text>No, but doesn't seem like a stalker, too well-groomed. Muscles are flabby. We dressed him, feed him a little. He's human, after all. Been almost a month... We thought maybe some rumor would spread about someone similar going missing. But nothing so far.\nYeah, he's peaceful, sits whole days and mumbles. At first he soiled himself, but now we take him out a couple times a day.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_dialog_41"><text>A month? Hmm... So this isn't the one I was thinking of.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_dialog_42"><text>The Zone... All kinds of things happen here.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_dialog_5"><text>What are you talking about?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_dialog_6"><text>Recently a scientist went missing at Yantar, with a stalker nicknamed Ghost, so I first thought...</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_dialog_7"><text>I'll tell you this: anything can happen in the Zone. Look, Screw, yesterday lost something in one place, and today a stalker came, said he found this thing in the Valley a week ago. That's how it is.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_dialog_8"><text>Yes, the Zone... So, this could really be Vasilyev. And he might know where to look for Ghost... Need to talk with Sakharov.</text></string>

<string id="assistant_dialog_start_101"><text>Begone! Begone, damn you...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_102"><text>Who the hell is this?! Egghead?! How'd you get here, you freak?!</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_103"><text>So you're... normal?! And I thought... But you're human...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_104"><text>Who were you expecting? Hey! Are you even alive?</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_105"><text>I'm not waiting for anyone anymore... I've been sitting here for three days, or more already... No ammo, no food... I don't know what to do...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_106"><text>So you came from the other side of the tunnel? Is there an exit there? Hey! Snap out of it!</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_107"><text>I don't know, I don't care anymore... They won't come back, we'll die here anyway...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_108"><text>Oh! Stop whining. Who are "they"? And who are you, by the way?</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_109"><text>What difference does it make now... Well, Mateyev's my surname, Vladimir. JR... junior researcher...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_110"><text>Call me Marked One. So who, you say, was here with you? And how did you get here?</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_111"><text>A few days ago our small group tried to get to the main control panel of the installation. He said it shouldn't be difficult...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_112"><text>Who's this "we"?</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_113"><text>Professor Vasilyev, me, and two stalkers - Ghost and Khokhol. Khokhol was clearing the path, Vasilyev and Ghost followed him, and I was bringing up the rear...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_114"><text>Well? So where are they? Come on, snap out of it, do I have to drag everything out of you?! What happened to you?</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_115"><text>Don't want to, don't drag it out, I'm not forcing you... Leave me... like they left me.</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_116"><text>Alright, calm down. Everything's fine, I'm here, I'm not planning to abandon you. Let's go in order. How did you get through here? Sakharov told me about dangerous radiation.</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_117"><text>Well... Radiation's very unstable - there are days when it practically disappears. That's when there was such a "window"... Vasilyev decided to take advantage of it. Why did I agree?!</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_118"><text>So where did they go and why did they leave you?</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_119"><text>I was wounded, probably, that's why... Why drag me around, just a burden...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_120"><text>Who wounded you?</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_121"><text>Vasilyev was turning on some switches, we already got upstairs, everything seemed quiet, but then from somewhere behind monsters started appearing... God, what horrors... I didn't even know such things existed. And right behind me someone screamed horribly, something crashed, I was thrown and spun around... But we had to go back! Ghost yelled something about teleports, sent Vasilyev down - to turn off the controls... But Vasilyev's human too! He couldn't do it... We went forward. Khokhol started covering us, we locked ourselves in some room, but there's no exit! No exit! And... and... I passed out.</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_122"><text>There we go... That's better. Get angrier, come on! Why did you give up?</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_123"><text>When I came to, only Vasilyev was nearby. He said Khokhol died, and Ghost used explosives to blast a hole into some tunnel and left. Vasilyev thought he went for help, so he stayed with me himself until I came to. Ghost still wasn't back, so Vasilyev decided to go for help himself, since alone he couldn't carry me, and I couldn't walk on my own... Ghost left his suit to Khokhol before leaving, some kind of healing one he had. But it didn't help him... Khokhol must've been real bad. I had a small supply of water and food... So I lasted here three days, or more... I don't even know how much time actually passed, lost count...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_124"><text>I see... Got it. How are you now, can you walk on your own?</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_125"><text>I don't think so, no strength left at all... probably I've been sitting here much longer than three days, and the wounds are making themselves known...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_126"><text>Alright, then here's what. I'll try to get out of here and bring help. Just hold on a little longer, they'll definitely pull you out.</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_151"><text>Marked One... I feel like complete shit...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_dialog_start_152"><text>Come on, don't pass out. Help will be here soon.</text></string>

<string id="vorobei_letter"><text>+2 Greetings, bro!\nI'm writing this letter to you from my new location with a bottle of excellent alcohol - and I sit here alone, Sparrow, with a faithful friend - and simply with my own faithful muzzle on my chest. It might be unpleasant to read. I'll tell you something "cool" if I find the strength, I won't make stuff up.\nWell, and about the cop - I'm forwarding some information, need to discuss how to proceed so we don't screw up.\nOn the old place through a week.\nP.S. Yes, don't take anyone with you to this place - the area's serious.</text></string>
<!-- Любер -->
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_101"><text>Bandits... b-bastards, were leading me to the old factory. Most likely they were planning to finish me there. At least one of our guys who was taken there before me, nobody saw again...</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_102"><text>What's there at this factory? And how did you even manage to get caught by bandits?</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_103"><text>I heard that Borov, the local watchdog, sniffed out that through the basements of this factory you can get into some secret underground. There was a laboratory there or something like that. But you can't just get in. I don't know the details, unfortunately. The crooks keep a crew of psychos there, watching over the place sort of. So I don't advise going there.\nAnd I got caught... They passed information to our group that Borov and his gang get weapons and equipment from somewhere outside the Zone. There was intel that a large weapons caravan was expected soon. Our squad was supposed to identify the meeting place on Ivantsov's orders. But apparently some scumbag is leaking our plans to Borov... Basically, they were waiting for us. Two dozen punks jumped us right at the entrance to the Valley.</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_104"><text>What happened to the others?</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_105"><text>They killed Sokhatyi and Krest right away, and us - me, Seryoga, Vovchik and Yurik - they took to the base. Yurik was taken away yesterday, don't know what happened to him. Seryoga and Vovchik are still with the bandits. They're keeping them in the basement... there's this building... big, unfinished. If you can, help them, okay? Or they'll also...</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_106"><text>Let's better rush to Prapor at the Garbage for help, there'll be more chances...</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_107"><text>Time's precious, and unknown who's selling us out, maybe a rat showed up at the checkpoint... I'll try to do something myself... Just got no strength at all, and problems with ammo... How about you?</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_1081"><text>I'll try to do something...</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_1082"><text>I have no reason to quarrel with the local bandits, sort it out yourselves.</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_109"><text>Thanks! I'll try to assemble a squad from those I know. Listen, there's another thing...</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_201"><text>Hey there, friend! Listen, here's the deal...</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_202"><text>Don't be shy, speak straight.</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_203"><text>Bandits took my PDA, and I had ammunition stash coordinates saved there. The data's encrypted, so I think these psychos won't get anything from it. I managed to turn on geolocation on the device. If you get the chance, try to track it down and find it. Then we'll have a chance to destroy this snake nest. And I won't shortchange you on the reward, I promise.</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_2041"><text>Alright, I'll try to get your PDA back.</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_2042"><text>I have my own road, so don't take offense.</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_301"><text>Marked One, any news?</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_401"><text>Thanks for helping, of course, but we have nothing more to talk about.</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_402"><text>Didn't really want to anyway.</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_501"><text>Feel sorry for my partner... was a good comrade. Sorry, I can't talk right now.</text></string>
<string id="val_escort_captive_new_dialog_502"><text>That's alright, I understand.</text></string>

<string id="bar_docent_start_dialog_101"><text>Come on, come on, stalker. Nice to see a new face in this local bedlam.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_start_dialog_102"><text>What's with the fancy talk?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_start_dialog_103"><text>Sorry, it gets the better of me sometimes. Not enough poetry. Let's get acquainted? Everyone here calls me Docent. Well, that's just for laughs. Actually, I didn't even finish graduate school. There I go talking again, so who do I have the honor of speaking with?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_start_dialog_104"><text>They call me Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_start_dialog_105"><text>Well then, Marked One, let's spin our Zone business. I collect information, mainly from PDAs that belonged to different stalkers. Of course, in most cases there's nothing interesting in them, pure garbage, but sometimes curious things turn up. So, if you happen to find someone's PDAs, bring them, we'll agree on the price.\nYes, condition doesn't matter. I'll take broken ones, dead ones, password-protected ones, and encrypted ones. I've got programs for decryption and bypassing various protection.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_start_dialog_106"><text>Got it. I'll keep it in mind.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_start_dialog_201"><text>What brings you here, stalker?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_start_dialog_251"><text>Hi, Marked One. Ivar came by about an hour ago, asking about you, whether you'd shown up here. Haven't met with him yet, no? He asked me to tell you to definitely stop by and see him.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_start_dialog_252"><text>What's up with him? How'd he even manage to hobble over?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_start_dialog_253"><text>He's still weak, of course, but slowly starting to get back to normal. Though he looked worried. Something's weighing on him, I think. You should go talk with him first, if you don't have anything urgent.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_start_dialog_254"><text>My business can wait. I'll go to Ivar, then come back.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_start_dialog_301"><text>Hi, Marked One. Any progress on my request or did you come about something else?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_start_dialog_401"><text>Hello, Marked One! What can I do for you?</text></string>

<string id="bar_docent_pda_buy_0"><text>I have a PDA, what'll you give for it?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_buy_1"><text>I can give... a bottle of vodka for it.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_buy_21"><text>That'll work, deal.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_buy_22"><text>Nah, I changed my mind.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_buy_31"><text>Well thanks, much appreciated.</text></string>

<string id="docent_pda_upgr_dialog_0"><text>Tell me, Docent, you know about different electronics, can you improve PDA performance somehow? I saw Sidorovich, for example, sells a special expansion module...</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_upgr_dialog_11"><text>Only with such modules can you do it. You don't think that someone in Zone conditions would actually tinker with these things, solder boards, program firmware and all that? I happen to have a couple of pretty rare expansion modules lying around. One gives the ability to put your own marks right on the PDA map and make notes for them. Stalkers say it's an extremely useful function. I'll give it away for just a couple of second-level artifacts in good condition. The other can crack simple passwords that protect other PDAs. My little know-how. I trade that one for a third-level artifact. Also in good condition, accordingly.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_upgr_dialog_12"><text>Going for round two? I already offered you to acquire either an expansion module designed for setting user marks on the map, or a module that picks simple passwords for other PDAs. Forgot? Then let me remind you: this pleasure will cost two "fresh" second-level artifacts for the first module and one third-level artifact for the second. Fresh too, of course.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_upgr_dialog_21"><text>Make notes on the map and crack other people's PDAs? Need to think if I need this...</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_upgr_dialog_221"><text>That's what I came for. I want to put marks on the map. Will these artifacts suit you?</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_upgr_dialog_222"><text>That's what I came for. I want to crack other people's PDAs. Will these artifacts suit you?</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_upgr_dialog_223"><text>Right, you did say that. Slipped my mind...</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_upgr_dialog_3"><text>Now I'll take a closer look... Very nice indeed. Your module, if you please. Hope you'll figure out the installation yourself?</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_upgr_dialog_4"><text>Yeah, I'll manage somehow.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_0"><text>My own PDA broke down.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_1"><text>Let's take a look. Maybe the battery just died?</text></string>

<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_31"><text>Hmm, yeah, it's not working... Probably something burned out in an emission. Happens sometimes. I have working ones, want one? I'll give it for a second-level artifact. If we try to revive yours, that takes time, well and work. Though.. everything's possible. I'll take it on, but for a third-level artifact. What do we decide?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_32"><text>Sure, why not. I'll give it for a second-level artifact. Want it?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_321"><text>I'll take it, here's the artifact.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_322"><text>Need to check how I'm doing with artifacts. I'll come back.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_331"><text>Here, look, almost new. Now I'll register its data to your name. Use it.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_41"><text>Go ahead, revive it, here's the artifact.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_42"><text>Give me a new one, what the hell.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_43"><text>I'll think it over, consult with people.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_51"><text>Wow, thanks. Don't worry, we'll restore it. Come back in half an hour, I think everything will be ready.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_52"><text>Here, look, almost new. Now I'll register its data to your name. Use it. Yes, you don't mind if I keep your old PDA, disassemble it for parts? From me - a bottle.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_53"><text>Consult, of course. Don't think I'm inflating the price.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_pda_broken_repair_62"><text>Yes, please. What do I need a broken one for?!</text></string>

<string id="docent_new_pda_val_dialog_0"><text>I need a new PDA. I... lost my old one.</text></string>
<string id="docent_new_pda_val_dialog_1"><text>I have several "clean" ones, after minor repair, almost new you could say. I'll give one for a second-level artifact.</text></string>
<string id="docent_new_pda_val_dialog_21"><text>No problem. Take this one.</text></string>
<string id="docent_new_pda_val_dialog_22"><text>Whoa! I'll think about it more, do I need it for such a price...</text></string>
<string id="docent_new_pda_val_dialog_3"><text>One moment... This one won't turn on, let's try another... There, yeah. All set, I've entered you in the database, now this will be your identifier.</text></string>

<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_3012"><text>Why just a hundred? Pour properly.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_3021"><text>You're not a heartfelt person, Marked One. Well, suit yourself... Anyway, I have one delicate matter.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_3022"><text>Our kind of guy! Don't mind the uniform, we're all people... Well, shall we? To us, good people!</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_3031"><text>Cap, let's skip the preambles.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_3032"><text>To good people!</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_305"><text>Anyway, listen. The other day I was asked to assign security to several scientists. I understand that these pampered worms need to be herded like sheep. Otherwise they'll either run off on their own, or the mon... monsters will devour them. I assigned two of my eagles. Don't know what happened there, but my little falcons vanished. And the nerds disappeared. Like they fell into water. For days now, not a word. Demian, he's in charge of security for the scientists, was really upset about this. And what can I do? Like, the Zone, mutants, anomalies... anything can happen. And everything would be fine, except a hunter I know told me he saw my boys running with crazy eyes toward the northern village.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_306"><text>So send soldiers, let them bring back your little soldiers.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_307"><text>Already sent them, they're not there. They slipped away! Bastards... And if they show up somewhere and start flapping their tongues, it's completely game over... Such a deal will be ruined because of two idiots... I'll tell you this: think we're just sitting here? Zone, artifacts... That's all bullshit! Real stable cash comes from "black gold"! Oil!\nI have a well here, pumping pure oil, it's almost like gasoline - light, almost no paraffin. The soldiers refine it using special technology.\nEvery two-three days, one way or another, a ton or more of good gasoline is produced. True, it's hard to transport out, but nothing, we manage.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_308"><text>Are you worried about your soldiers or your business? What do you need from me?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_309"><text>You're a normal guy, Marked One, experienced, can tell right away! Neighbors from the Cordon told me about you. If these goats didn't leave the perimeter, then they're holed up somewhere nearby. They need something to drink and eat. Maybe you'll look for these freaks. Just without too much noise, you understand. And if you find them, let me know. Then I'll figure out what to do myself. You won't regret it.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_310"><text>Maybe I'll manage to find your soldiers, maybe not. You said it yourself - the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_401"><text>Got anything on our business?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_40111"><text>Still nothing, like they fell into water.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_40112"><text>Found your little falcons. They're at Forgotten Village, sitting in the basement, eating rats and drooling. Basically... deal with them yourself.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_402"><text>Marked One, I believed in you! Now you can take as much gasoline as you can carry. What do the soldiers say? Did something happen?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_403"><text>They say that at the burned village, nearby here, scientists were conducting some experiment and something went wrong. They disappeared. Like, there's a gate to hell there and it sucked them in.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_404"><text>What are you talking about?!</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_405"><text>How should I know! The soldiers say the scientists approached a bubble, took out some contraption, turned something on and... vanished. Like that bubble sucked them in. The soldiers, naturally, got scared they'd be blamed for everything, grabbed their legs and headed wherever their eyes looked. So don't celebrate too early, captain. It's a murky story. If those nerds surface somewhere, there'll be questions for sure.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_406"><text>Something needs to be done. I don't need extra worries... Marked One, go to that village, take an experienced look, maybe those scientists are lying under some burned wall. I don't believe in miracles.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_407"><text>I've been there, more than once. Nobody's there, just dogs and rats wandering around.\nI fulfilled my part of the deal, now I could use some help too.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_408"><text>Always, whatever we can... what do you need?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_409"><text>I'm tight on ammo, and you guys have supplies I think? I'd buy some... Or trade for something.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_4010"><text>Ammo we have, sure... But let's be honest. What can you offer for it? Those paper bills of yours? They're not even good for wiping your ass. Artifacts? What do I need them for? I'll be straight: my interest is real currency. Some traders write bearer bank checks. One check - a thousand bucks. Get the checks, then we'll talk.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_4011"><text>And what will I get for them?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_4012"><text>A thousand bucks is... Basically, I'll supply ammo for a grand. For the AK-74, 5.45 caliber, or even for AKM - 7.62... So - bring them.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_4013"><text>Deal, prepare the ammo.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_4014"><text>Don't forget about the village. If you find out anything, let me know. Keep the ammo, you earned it.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_dialog_start_501"><text>You're coming here too often. On business or just?</text></string>
<string id="tex_mar_leader_job"><text>The military captain guarding the oil drilling well asked to get rid of the scientists' bodies at the burned village. Dirty work, but the cap promised he won't shortchange me.</text></string>

<string id="mar_factory_leader_job_dialog_0"><text>Listen, captain, miracles and nothing else.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_job_dialog_1"><text>What are you talking about? Maybe some vodka? You don't look like yourself.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_job_dialog_2"><text>I found the bodies at the burned village, in lab suits. Intact, not even touched by monsters. Looks like those are exactly the ones who... disappeared. And at the village, some devilry is happening, no doubt.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_job_dialog_3"><text>Found them?! How?.. You said you searched everything there? Damn... one thing after another. What now? Everything just settled down. They'll raise hell again. Oh, bad timing, bad timing... Maybe you'll make it so nobody finds these corpses, even by accident. Zone, anomalies...</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_job_dialog_4"><text>Don't understand?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_job_dialog_5"><text>Well, anomalies, you understand? Help me out, I'll thank you, don't doubt it. Ammo, fuel, maybe even find something from weapons... If I send my morons again, some other nonsense will happen.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_job_dialog_61"><text>I'm not a garbage man, sort it out without me.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_job_dialog_62"><text>Alright, cap. I'll take a look. Maybe I'll think of something.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_job_dialog_71"><text>Then get lost! And watch your back... You never know!</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_job_dialog_72"><text>Just don't take too long, in case someone finds them first.</text></string>

<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_0"><text>I dealt with the corpses.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_1"><text>And how? Didn't leave traces?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_2"><text>They got into an anomaly! Consider they walked there themselves. Not even bones left.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_3"><text>You're a real man! A bottle's on me! Ha-ha... Just kidding... Nobody saw?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_4"><text>Nah, all clean. So, what were you offering?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_51"><text>Nobody... that's good. As agreed, I can pour you pistol ammo, lots, 20 packs. Or rifle rounds, 5.45 caliber, about three hundred. Or, if you want, I'll give the same amount for AKM. And a canister of gasoline as a bonus. If you don't need ammo and fuel, there are two guns to choose from: "APB" with silencer included or "AKS-74N". What'll it be?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_52"><text>Nobody... that's good. As agreed, I can pour you pistol ammo, lots, 20 packs. Or rifle rounds, 5.45 caliber, about three hundred. Or, if you want, I'll give the same amount for AKM. And a canister of gasoline as a bonus. Choose.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_61"><text>If it's a lot, give me pistol rounds!</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_62"><text>I'll take AK ammo.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_63"><text>Give me the AKM rounds, caliber matters.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_64"><text>"APB"! Good weapons never hurt.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_65"><text>I'll take the "AKS-74N", you can attach all kinds of gadgets to it!</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_71"><text>Deal! Take the ammo and canister as extra.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_72"><text>Deal! Take the ammo and canister as extra.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_73"><text>Deal! Take the ammo and canister as extra.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_74"><text>Deal! Take it.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_75"><text>Deal! Take it.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_corps_dialog_8"><text>See you, captain... Maybe we'll meet again.</text></string>

<string id="mar_factory_leader_vine_dialog_0"><text>Here's a present from Sergeant Sherstyuk. You know him, right? Says your birthday's coming up, if so, congratulations.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_vine_dialog_1"><text>Know him, sure... Birthday, you say?! Hmm... What's the present?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_vine_dialog_2"><text>A barrel of foreign wine.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_vine_dialog_3"><text>Booze, I see. That all?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_vine_dialog_4"><text>He said verbally that supplies are delayed for now. He'll let you know later when and what. Said you'd understand.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_vine_dialog_5"><text>Delayed... Yeah... If that's all, take this, for your trouble. Or maybe some wine, a glass each?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_vine_dialog_6"><text>I still have to trudge back. Better on a clear head.</text></string>

<string id="mar_factory_leader_exchange_dialog_0"><text>I have a bank check, can I get ammo?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_exchange_dialog_1"><text>No problem! Bucks are bucks even in Africa. What do you want? 5.45 or 7.62?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_exchange_dialog_21"><text>For AK-74, 5.45.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_exchange_dialog_22"><text>For AKM, 7.62.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_exchange_dialog_23"><text>I changed my mind.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_exchange_dialog_31"><text>Your money - became ours. Take the ammo.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_exchange_dialog_32"><text>Made the trade blind... Take the ammo.</text></string>

<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_0"><text>Do you know Captain Sergeev?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_100"><text>I know lots of people. You should pour for warmth, it's getting chilly. Not manly to talk dry.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_200"><text>Hmm. What's your interest?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_101"><text>Don't have any spirits on me, we'll talk later then.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_2"><text>Yeah, there's interest. I found letters at Garbage, seems a clerk died there or someone dropped a bag. Army mail. I showed soldiers, some even reached their addressees. But one letter... Actually the surname - Captain Sergeev... They say he was here?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_3"><text>Listen, Marked One, you ask too many questions. You're not, by chance, you know? Well, not buying Slavic wardrobes? Just kidding, of course, but in every joke... You pour.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_4"><text>Alright... \n ... \nSo what about Sergeev?</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_5"><text>Ehhhh, nasty stuff... Marked One, don't rush, I'll be talking to wild cats soon at this rate. For once I can drink with a normal guy.\nYour captain, the Sergeev one, was here before me... Good guy, but reckless, too desperate. Soldiers respected him, though they were scared too, he had a heavy fist. They say he came to us from military intelligence, or similar structure. His uncle or someone from his family is connected up top. But he screwed up big somewhere, so they hid him in the Zone... Well, to fix his service record, you know. But he didn't calm down here either, had ants in his pants apparently. He got involved with one stalker who was working with some nerds. According to the soldiers, he had strange eyes - transparent. They called him Ghost.\nWhat's wrong? Pour already! Eh, not Hennessy, but we're not in a bar either!</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_6"><text>Just thinking... Let's have another one.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_7"><text>Good!\n ... \nSo anyway, he left a sergeant in charge and took off somewhere. Was gone about three days. Then a signal came from the Track area asking for help. The sergeant turned out to be smart, went there competently without losses with another conscript and pulled out the captain. He was in bad shape, looked like broken ribs, medium burns and a torn wound on the thigh. Was delirious, cursing that Ghost the whole time. They pulled him out of the Zone by transport to the hospital.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_8"><text>Hmm, something doesn't add up.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_9"><text>Don't get worked up, pour... If you try to leave, you won't make it!\nJoke...\nThe thing is, his relative, well not himself but through my command, asked to conduct an investigation and prepare two reports. One heroic - how Sergeev saved personnel and the facility, you know, for the service record or promotion. And the second unofficial, apparently for beating up the nephew at home or something else. And in exchange they hinted they know about my business plans and won't interfere... That's how it is.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_10"><text>Yeah, shame... \n ... \nSeemed like I'd meet Sergeev, maybe remember something. Let's have one last one.</text></string>
<string id="mar_factory_leader_postmens_dialog_11"><text>Stop grieving! There are almost as many Sergeevs in our world as Ivanovs! Maybe your neighbor was Sergeev, or the gym teacher at school. Who knows. Don't be sad. And take this... for the road.</text></string>

<string id="vergas_blockpost_case_0"><text>Listen, have you seen a case like this?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_blockpost_case_1"><text>Like this? Hmm... I think I've seen it. Let me remember... Seems like someone brought one like this. Need to ask at the Bar. The mechanics there are great experts in this.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_blockpost_case_2"><text>Alright, we'll see.</text></string>

<string id="dolgovazyi_torch_upgr_start_dlg_0"><text>Why so gloomy, Vitaly? No customers coming?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_torch_upgr_start_dlg_1"><text>More like the opposite. Duty guys threw me some work. Their raid group yesterday ran into a big pack of mutants at Wild Territory. Got the squad beat up bad. Heard there were casualties too. Well, and now I have to fix up their gear, naturally.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_torch_upgr_start_dlg_2"><text>Sad occasion, sure, but work is work. They have theirs, you have yours. Or am I missing something?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_torch_upgr_start_dlg_3"><text>The whole problem is the repair order's urgent. Don't know why they're in such a hurry, but they insistently ask to get everything in proper shape as soon as possible. Everything would be fine, I'm not afraid of work, but as luck would have it, my buddy who sends me armor plates for repairs from beyond the "perimeter" let me down. Ended up in the hospital with appendicitis. I have some stuff left in reserve, but definitely not enough for everything. And there are other orders too. Can't figure out what to do.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_torch_upgr_start_dlg_4"><text>Hmm... if I were you, I'd try to bargain with the soldiers. They must have spare ones for their army body armor, right? The key is finding the right approach. With enough firewater available, it's not hard at all.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_torch_upgr_start_dlg_5"><text>Listen, maybe you could handle this business? I need to find enough plates for at least three suits. Can you get that many? What would interest you...\nOh, I see your head flashlight's pretty weak, judging by the bulb. I can replace it with a more powerful one as thanks. It'll shine farther and brighter. True, you'll have to change batteries a bit more often, but I assure you, it's worth it. How's that for a deal?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_torch_upgr_start_dlg_61"><text>That could actually be useful. Especially if I have to crawl through dark basements. Alright, I agree.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_torch_upgr_start_dlg_62"><text>Sorry, I don't have time for this. I gave you the idea, handle the rest yourself.</text></string>
<string id="tex_dolgovazyi_torch_article"><text>The stalker equipment repair master from the Bar asks me to find him armor plates in quantities sufficient to fix three suits. The most reasonable approach would be to contact the military. For help with this matter Lanky promised to install a more powerful bulb in my flashlight.</text></string>

<string id="dolgovazyi_torch_upgr_done_dlg_0"><text>How's business going? Haven't figured out where to get armor plates yet?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_torch_upgr_done_dlg_1"><text>Lousy. Having to turn down even regular customers for now. Got an idea to buy all kinds of junk from the Junkman at Sanatorium and pick out more or less intact plates from it. Maybe I'll manage somehow until my supplier buddy gets back on his feet. But the Duty order is still hanging and they're very unhappy about it.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_torch_upgr_done_dlg_2"><text>Then I have good news for you. Managed to get three army body armors. Think there'll be enough plates in them for you to close the Duty order. Here they are, take them.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_torch_upgr_done_dlg_3"><text>Thanks a lot! You really helped out. Yeah, this'll be more than enough for the order, and there'll be some left over.\nI promised you a powerful bulb for your flashlight, right? I'll do that in a flash... where are they now. Ah, here! Just a second, just a second... There, use it. And thanks again.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovazyi_torch_upgr_done_dlg_4"><text>Thanks to you too. Well, stay healthy!</text></string>

<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_0"><text>Know who makes cases like these?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_1"><text>Open your eyes, Marked One, there's exactly the same one standing there. I sometimes craft them on order... For those who don't want their personal business accessible to the curious. I get these locks on special order.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_2"><text>Well, great! Won't you give it to me? I'll thank you!</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_3"><text>The one on the safe? It's broken, fools tried to open it, just mangled the whole lid... But I can find you a whole one. But you'll owe me, I think you understand?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_4"><text>Of course! And how much do I owe?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_5"><text>I'd say not how much, but what! There's one craftsman nearby - at the Freedom base... Screw they call him. He knows a trick, how to prepare combustible mixture for flamethrowers. You understand yourself, it's quite troublesome business to experiment with... So you, as thanks, try to learn the exact method. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_61"><text>Alright, deal! Where's the case?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_62"><text>No other way? I'm not sure I'll find this Screw.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_63"><text>Probably I'll look elsewhere... Later.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_71"><text>I trust you. It's in the Barkeep's backroom, take a look, if he starts making trouble, tell him I'll give him another one...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_72"><text>Another way? Well then let's do this: there's an artifact called "Cobblestone". It has anti-gravitational properties. I want to try building it into some suit. If you come across one, bring it?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_81"><text>Well alright, I'll bring it if I find one.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_82"><text>I don't like to be in debt! What if I don't find it? Then what?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_91"><text>Well great! I believe you. The case is in the Barkeep's backroom, take a look, if he starts making trouble, tell him I'll give him another one...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_92"><text>Eh, you're so stubborn... Got money? Give me a check for a ton of western cash, and we're even...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_101"><text>Don't have that kind of money...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_102"><text>Now we're talking! Instead of go here, find that... Here's the check!</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_111"><text>Alright, go on - it's in the Barkeep's backroom, take a look, if he starts making trouble, tell him I'll give him another one...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_121"><text>Well, you helped out... Later...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_blockpost_case_122"><text>Well, you helped out... Later...</text></string>
<!-- new солдатик у плит -->
<string id="private_blockpost_case_101"><text>Stalker! Did Kuznetsov send you?</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_1021"><text>Consider that he did. I'm here for the case.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_1022"><text>Consider that he did. But I'm empty-handed for now. Came to scout, kinda.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_103"><text>Did you bring vodka? They promised me... a crate!</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_1041"><text>Listen, young man, they allocated three bottles for this job, so take what you're given and hand over the case. And this one's for you to swap. Let's make it quick. I don't like it here with you guys. Someone might wake up, go to the bushes to take a leak, and here we are...</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_1042"><text>Listen, young man, they only allocated three bottles for this job... True, I forgot them. But I'll be right back, wait a bit.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_1051"><text>Just three bottles? That's barely enough for me and the boys to sit down once, and even then... Ah, alright. Here's the case.\nListen, don't you have any more vodka with you? I heard stalkers always carry it, for radiation and all that...</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_1052"><text>You hurry up. I'll be here till morning, then only come back the next night.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_1061"><text>Vodka in the Zone is basically currency. And just "give me some" won't work. If you have something to offer in trade, then maybe I can find a couple bottles, maybe more.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_106"><text>That's what I'm talking about. It's depressing here. Officers go wild, grab everything for themselves. And us simple soldiers have no life... But have a little drink, and discharge seems closer... If anything, me or someone else will come out every night. We can supply ammo for vodka. For a bottle, a couple packs for AK-74. There's also some for AK-47, but less of those, so only one pack.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_107"><text>Not much... Got anything else?</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_108"><text>There's something. But different price now. Now it's scientific.\nI came across an interesting piece of paper. Our guys recently caught a stalker trying to get out of the Zone. What was valuable, the brass pocketed, and threw out the rest. I picked it up, read the papers, asked around the village - your people say it's a recipe, how to get one artifact from another. Heard stalkers pay good money for such information, so I won't give it for less than ten bottles.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_109"><text>At least give me a hint what's written there. I won't pay ten bottles for a pig in a poke.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_1091"><text>Like you need to - "stand no more than two steps from 'Springboard' and throw kolobok at an angle"... What kind of kolobok? Hell knows... What comes from that kolobok I'll tell when you bring vodka.</text></string>

<string id="private_blockpost_case_1093"><text>Like you need to - "stand no more than two steps from 'Electra' and throw battery at an angle"... What kind of battery? From a flashlight or what? Hell knows... What comes from that battery I'll tell when you bring vodka.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_110"><text>Hmm... understood. Later soldier, not saying goodbye.</text></string>
<!-- если не принесли водку - доносим  -->		
<string id="private_blockpost_case_201"><text>Back for the case? Didn't forget to bring vodka?</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_2021"><text>Yeah. Brought both the replacement case and vodka. Take everything. And let's make it quick. I don't like it here with you guys. Someone might wake up, go to the bushes to take a leak, and here we are...</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_2022"><text>Nah, I wanted to check if you're waiting in place.</text></string>

<string id="private_blockpost_case_312"><text>For a bottle I'll give a couple packs for AK-74 or one pack for AK-47. Which do you want?</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_3131"><text>Give me bullets for AK-74.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_3132"><text>Need ammo for AK-47.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_3133"><text>I'll come back later.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_3141"><text>One pack and another pack of 5.45... Maybe something else?</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_3142"><text>Your pack of 7.62... Maybe need more?</text></string>
<!-- рецепт -->
<string id="tex_private_blockpost_recipt"><text>For ten bottles of vodka the soldier at the blockpost promised to give me a paper with a recipe written on it.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_321"><text>That precious paper didn't get lost?</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_322"><text>Don't worry, keeping it in my inner pocket. Did you bring vodka?</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_3231"><text>Ten bottles. As agreed. Where's the recipe?</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_3232"><text>Just wondering, maybe you already smoked it.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_324"><text>Here, this paper. Bit worn, but you can make out the writing.</text></string>
<!-- гравики - private_blockpost_outfit -->
<string id="private_blockpost_case_331"><text>It was you who told Sidor about the unique body armor lying around here with you guys, wasn't it?</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_332"><text>Maybe it was me. So what?</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_333"><text>I need them. Haven't floated away yet, I hope?</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_334"><text>Haven't floated away. I accidentally found them in the attic of our barracks. Who and when stashed them there - no clue. Judging by how much dust was there, they haven't been remembered for a very long time, but I moved them to... another place just in case. Ready to go get them right now, if you have a crate of white stuff for me.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_335"><text>What are you, soldier?! A crate of vodka for him... won't you puke? Ten bottles - that's my limit.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_336"><text>Nope. I'm educated now, know that in stalker circles vodka is the most important currency, and everyone has so much stocked that ten people could get wasted. Won't give for less than a crate. Judge for yourself: what if someone still figures out to look for these suits? There'll be hell to pay. Nobody counts ammo, but this... Anyway, I'm taking a risk.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_337"><text>Damn... And who fed you such nonsense? Probably Sidor? Alright, you'll get your crate.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_338"><text>Sweet! I'll dash there and back now, about half an hour. If I don't make it back by morning or you don't have time to get vodka, then paddle over next night.</text></string>

<string id="private_blockpost_case_3422"><text>I haven't gone for the suits yet. Wait.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_3431"><text>Twenty bottles. Watch you don't break them while carrying.</text></string>
<string id="private_blockpost_case_3432"><text>Soon. Wanted to make sure everything's good with you.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_start_dialog_104"><text>Well... Yes. And who are you?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_start_dialog_105"><text>Just call me Prapor. For the especially dense - this isn't a rank, it's, so to speak, an operational pseudonym. For now I'm handling my business here at the Bar. If there's any interest in you, I'll contact you, don't doubt it. And for now seek, Marked One, what you were seeking. I'll even wish you luck.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_start_dialog_106"><text>Thanks for the kind word... Prapor.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_start_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, why do you keep hanging around here? Got something to say - say it, if not - move along...</text></string>
<string id="prapor_start_dialog_202"><text>You could be softer, or something...</text></string>

<string id="prapor_start_dialog_204"><text>Everyone's so business-like...</text></string>

<string id="prapor_bar_start_dialog_202"><text>Better help me, maybe you know something about Strelok or Ghost?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_bar_start_dialog_203"><text>Maybe I do...\nStrelok...\nStrelok is a legendary figure, something like Semetsky. Some say they've seen him, others... Others are hard to believe...\nHaven't met Vasyan Ryaboi? Not long ago he was flapping his tongue at the Bar that Strelok took him as a partner for some job.\nBut for now I don't see any interest in laying out more. Let's see what you do next.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_bar_start_dialog_301"><text>So, brother? Did you find what you were looking for? Or what?</text></string>

<string id="lisiy_patrul_start_101"><text>Oh! You scared me, stalker, why are you prowling in the dark?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_patrul_start_102"><text>Got business...</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_patrul_start_103"><text>Business... Everyone's got business. You better not show yourself. Better go get some sleep. You look - I've seen the dead looking better. What's your name?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_patrul_start_104"><text>Marked One. And who are you?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_patrul_start_105"><text>Baldy. Just Baldy, everyone here knows me. Come to the bar in the morning, we'll throw some dice, check your luck.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_patrul_start_106"><text>Alright, if I have time - I'll drop by.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_patrul_start_107"><text>Well later, I'm walking on - keeping watch.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_patrul_start_201"><text>Marked One... Still bustling around, I see.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_patrul_start_202"><text>Baldy, have you heard anything about Strelok or Ghost?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_patrul_start_203"><text>Who hasn't heard about them... But let's talk later, closer to noon, at the bar. I'm busy with business here, if you hadn't noticed.</text></string>

<string id="bar_barin_start_51"><text>I'm on patrol now, can't talk, but as soon as I'm relieved - straight to the Bar. We'll chat there over a glass or two, deal?</text></string>
<string id="bar_barin_start_52"><text>Deal.</text></string>
<string id="bar_barin_start_101"><text>Oh... Look how the Zone mangled you. Want a drink?</text></string>
<string id="bar_barin_start_102"><text>Don't want to for now. Haven't we met before? Maybe heard something about Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="bar_barin_start_103"><text>What's your name, curious one?</text></string>
<string id="bar_barin_start_104"><text>Marked One... Yes. And who are you?</text></string>
<string id="bar_barin_start_105"><text>Right on the nose. As in, Marked One. They know me here as Baron. Lost a friend recently. Bastard. There are people like that... Went through so much with him, and he got greedy over a lousy rifle... E-eh... Sure you don't want a drink? What kind of people...</text></string>
<string id="bar_barin_start_106"><text>No, I have business. I'll come back later...</text></string>
<string id="bar_barin_start_201"><text>You again... My soul burns, you understand!</text></string>
<string id="bar_barin_start_202"><text>Better help me, maybe you know something about Strelok or Ghost?</text></string>
<string id="bar_barin_start_203"><text>Strelok, Ghost... What's the difference. We'll all be there.</text></string>

<string id="gar_bandit_robber_101"><text>So-so. Well hey there, little bro. Your face looks familiar somehow.</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_102"><text>Oh really? So what? What's this business here?</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_103"><text>Well like this. Duty guys kinda made tracks. And now we're heroically defendin' the white and fluffy little stalkers from scary monsters. Yeah! And like we deserve a reward for this. You dig?</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_1041"><text>Oh really? What if Borov finds out about this?</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_1042"><text>Lots of you types, lovers of freebies...</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_1051"><text>Borov - Shmorov, who... Ah! So I'm lookin' - familiar face! I saw how you had beef with the boys. Damn, what was your name... There! Marked One! Yeah? I got eagle eyes!\nBorov moved the gang to another hideout. But the brothers are afraid that after that hideout they won't be able to get up with a jack... You know what I mean. So me and my pals will wait for now before chargin' somewhere. We got it good here for now.\nYou chatty devil! You got me talkin'... Anyway, give us cash, then we'll let you pass right here. I remember - you're tough, you got it.</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_1052"><text>We ain't amateurs! We're professionals! And who are you, hotshot, who... Ah! So I'm lookin' - familiar face! I saw how you had beef with the boys. Damn, what was your name... There! Marked One! Yeah? I got eagle eyes!\nBorov kinda went and croaked completely. So what - now we're the bosses here. Yeah!\nYou chatty devil! You got me talkin'... Anyway, give us cash, then we'll let you pass right here. I remember - you're tough, you got it.</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_106"><text>Cash? How much? And most importantly - why should I?</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_107"><text>Come on! We're being fair... A grand in bucks, just one little paper... That ain't much, is it? Look - the boys are steamin', tired of holdin' their pieces.\nAnd about your interest... Heard your head ain't all right? And you're lookin' for one pal. Like Strelok was his handle? Yeah? Well I can tell ya where he made tracks straight there, to the center of this very Zone.\nI was still a green rookie then, standin' watch, when he with his pal, what was his name... Ah! Hook! Yeah. Well they went. Into those dungeons...</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_108"><text>You saw Strelok? What did he look like?</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_109"><text>Well you, uh, you fork over the cash, and I'll paint ya the whole picture. What and how...</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_201"><text>Opa-nopa! Marked One! Well what, everything good? A grand in Baku money - and we'll part like ships in the sea, to our own pleasures.</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_2021"><text>Alright, here's your check... Come on, talk.</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_2022"><text>I need to think it over...</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_203"><text>Oh! Damn... Should've asked for more. But my word is harder than stone! Said a grand - means a grand. You can walk around here for now. Well and then, who knows. Just don't wave your piece and don't mess with the boys.</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_204"><text>Too much talk, tell me about Strelok - where, how, what...</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_205"><text>Why you so harsh... Could've shot the breeze about life...\nAlright, alright, don't grind your teeth at me... I'm bein' respectful.\nAnyway, it was last summer. This same Strelok wanted to haul a bunch of heavy junk, so he made a deal with our boss, what he gave him, Strelok to the boss I mean, I dunno. But the boss gave us, four pals, a job - to help. So we hauled Strelok's boxes right to the entrance to the underground. We didn't go further - screw that. The two of them went with his buddy.</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_206"><text>What's he like - Strelok? Who does he look like?</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_207"><text>E-e-eh... Well you asked. A guy like any guy... He was wearin' a mask. Not very tall, maybe your height. So much time's passed, here you don't remember who you mugged yesterday, let alone back then...</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_208"><text>What kind of underground? Where did he go...</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_209"><text>Well I heard with half an ear how this same Strelok with his buddy were chatterin' about how this underground would lead underneath straight to the catafalque... Or no, well something like that. I figured then - what they need a catafalque for? Here monsters'll eat ya without any funeral...</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_210"><text>Catafalque? Maybe sarcophagus? And where's the underground?</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_211"><text>Maybe sarcophagus, what's the difference... And the underground's there. There's this thick door. Well in the basement, where our hideout used to be. But from there constantly some roarin' and bangin' hard. Borov ordered to block that door just in case. Well the pals blocked it with boxes. Wanted to blow it up completely, but Borov wouldn't let 'em, said maybe we'd need to leave ourselves if they press us. And then one asshole said to pour cement over the whole entrance to that basement, so it'd be for sure. Guess his own ass got scared.</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_301"><text>Pal! How's it goin'? You can pass, you're our guy, brother!</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_401"><text>Wow! Look who's in Hollywood! Why you hoppin' around here and there?</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_402"><text>On my business. What else?</text></string>
<string id="gar_bandit_robber_403"><text>Well like this. Don't get worked up, brother - everything's cool! We respect those who follow the code. Need to - then walk. No hard feelings, yeah?</text></string>

<string id="esc_sid_yan_to_marsh_0"><text>Respected sir, could you show me a safe path?</text></string>
<string id="esc_sid_yan_to_marsh_1"><text>Listen to how you talk! Where are you heading? Maybe I'll need something there too?</text></string>
<string id="esc_sid_yan_to_marsh_2"><text>Sakharov said there's a scientists' camp somewhere in the Swamps... Don't happen to know how to get there?</text></string>
<string id="esc_sid_yan_to_marsh_3"><text>Heard something with half an ear... Mmmm... Yeah!\nTo be honest, it's not my rule to hand out information for free... But as an exception...\nBasically, when you leave me, turn left, cross the ravine, near the barbed wire there's a trailer lying around - through it you'll get to an abandoned village... We call it "Southern" among ourselves. And there along the path straight south... In those parts was that base.\nI hope you won't forget about me if you find something interesting...</text></string>
<string id="esc_sid_yan_to_marsh_4"><text>I'll try not to forget.</text></string>

<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_101"><text>Well, hello!</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_102"><text>You're Butterfingers? I have a question about the container you were supposed to deliver.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_103"><text>Well, I am. What's it to you? Sidor already chewed my ear off! Am I to blame?! These creatures attacked me, had to stay alive... Should I pay with my life for a damn box?</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_104"><text>Don't boil over... Sidor told me to find it. Where'd you lose it?</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_105"><text>Where? M-m-m... Listen, after these "adventures" I'm still shaking. I need to take something "calming" inside. Got any?</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_106"><text>Want some fresh milk too? What am I, a kid? You screwed up, I gotta clean up after you, and now bring you booze too. Can't you just tell me for free?</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_107"><text>What hints?! And anyway: who are you? I'm seeing you for the first time and don't even know if you're a stalker or just a thug looking for easy pickings. All kinds wander around here sometimes... You look, to put it frankly, lousy: your suit's torn, no weapon. Where'd you come from?</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_108"><text>Where from and who - I don't remember. Recently woke up in this very basement. Sidorovich called me Marked One. Nice to meet you.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_109"><text>Marked One... haven't heard of you. Newbie, eh? Wouldn't tell by looking. Don't be surprised, I know about many veteran stalkers, collect stories about them, write them down. Interesting people come here sometimes. What's true in their stories and what isn't, that's beside the point, but people like to listen to such tales. That's mainly how I live. Going after loot somehow doesn't work out. Always get into something. Tried so many times. And this time... screwed up again.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_110"><text>Better tell me where to look for the container. Sidorovich is waiting.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_111"><text>I could really use a hundred grams, huh? My hands are shaking and my head's foggy. You don't have any? We could have a drink for getting acquainted too.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_1121"><text>My own head's like cast iron, and I don't have any vodka. Maybe later.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_1122"><text>Hell with it, I do have a bottle. Come on, to getting acquainted!</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_1131"><text>This... here, if anything, you can search around the village, folks sometimes leave stashes, for hangovers and such. Or there's Stas, Sidor's guard, he always has vodka. He "quarters" in the last house on the left side, when he's not on duty...</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_1141"><text>Alright, I'll take a look.</text></string>

<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_151"><text>Hello, stalker! We don't seem to know each other... They call me Kostik, and what's your name?</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_152"><text>Yeah, if only I knew... I have memory problems. The local trader dubbed me Marked One, that's what I go by for now.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_153"><text>Marked One? Haven't heard that handle. Newbie, eh? Wouldn't tell by looking. Don't be surprised, I know about many veteran stalkers, collect stories about them, write them down. Interesting people come here sometimes. What's true in their stories and what isn't, that's beside the point, but people like to listen to such tales. That's mainly how I live. Going after loot somehow doesn't work out. Always get into something. </text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_154"><text>Well, nice to meet you. Maybe I'll drop by sometime to listen to your stories.</text></string>

<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_201"><text>Well, did you bring her, the "darling"?</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_2021"><text>Yep, here you go, pour it out.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_2022"><text>Haven't found it yet...</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_2031"><text>Oh! Awesome! We'll get patched up too... \nYou asked about the container. Basically, look: I was coming from the direction of Garbage, settled up with the soldiers under the destroyed bridge. They always ask for grub as payment for passage, in case you didn't know. And I keep sausage for such occasions in the old house by the road, in the attic. There should still be something left there, help yourself.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_2041"><text>Got it, thanks! What happened next, where'd you lose the container?</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_2051"><text>So here's what... From the checkpoint I slowly moved toward the village. Thought I'd be able to carefully go around the beasts, but it didn't work out. Right about here, come on, I'll mark it on your PDA, these creatures attacked me. Basically, there's both boars nearby and mole rats, and the container's heavy as hell! So I had to drop it... I don't remember the exact spot, but definitely somewhere in that area.\nBy the way, just so you know, these handhelds glitch sometimes. It happens that markers disappear from the map. So try to at least roughly remember the important places.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_2061"><text>Everything's clear with you... Alright, see ya.</text></string>

<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_301"><text>Listen! Everything I knew, I already told you! Don't waste my time.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_302"><text>Calm down, I just have some kind of glitch with my PDA - the marker you placed disappeared. Can you orient me again?</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_303"><text>Damn it! Alright, come on, so be it.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_304"><text>Thanks!</text></string>

<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_351"><text>Everything I knew, I already told you! Don't waste my time.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_352"><text>Yeah, I found that damn box. I'll go make... the benefactor happy.</text></string>

<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_401"><text>Marked One, I hope you didn't come to blow my brains out about that damn container again?</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_4021"><text>Relax, the matter's resolved. Sidorovich isn't holding a grudge.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_4022"><text>Relax, the matter's resolved. Well, you'll work a little for free for Sidorovich... nothing terrible.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_4031"><text>Phew! What a relief, I thought he'd make me work it off completely. Thanks, buddy! Too bad I can't really repay you - I'm totally broke. Except, here, I can give you a couple cans. Just bought some for myself the other day as reserves, got a small stock.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_4032"><text>Easy for you to say. You still don't know that bastard well: he'll work me to death with all kinds of penny errands...</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_4041"><text>Won't refuse, thanks. I'm going, see you around.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_4042"><text>Nothing, you'll make up for it later. Main thing is you stayed alive and unharmed back then.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_451"><text>Glad to see you, Marked One!</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_501"><text>Hello, Marked One!</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_50121"><text>And no illness to you.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_50122"><text>Decided to leave your cozy spot and go out among people? Why can't you sit still in the village, with your luck? Dangerous...</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_5013"><text>Not more dangerous than standing guard at night. Fanat's gone wild, introduced army discipline. Can't really sit by the fire anymore. You know my trade. How can I do it if there's no time to talk with visiting stalkers. The guys decided to break away, so I'm with them. A lot of interesting people pass through here during the day. And when we get out to Garbage, we can also learn a lot of curious and unusual stuff.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_50141"><text>When you collect all kinds of tall tales, will you share them? Honestly interesting.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_50151"><text>You helped us all here. So you're always a welcome guest.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_50142"><text>And that little suit I brought you, what'd you do with it?</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_50152"><text>Well when we were gathering here, I traded it with one stalker for ammo and provisions, to somehow get by at first. Now we've settled in. We earn our own way. Can't complain.</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_5016"><text>You've got a good group here. Next time, if I'm passing by, you won't kick me out?</text></string>
<string id="esc_neumeha_start_dialog_5017"><text>You're always a welcome guest.</text></string>

<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_101"><text>Well what you sniffin' around here for? Got any junk?</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_102"><text>Got nothing on me. I got business with you.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_103"><text>Well fo' real... Let's chat. Damn what a mug you got! If ya dream about it - you'll piss your pants. What should I call ya, sickly?</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_104"><text>Marked One. I'm from the stalkers. About the prisoner, Nimble.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_105"><text>That bastard? He's a rat. Stuck his ratty mug into our common fund! If we didn't need to get sumthin' back - we'd have zeroed him no questions asked. Yeah, the scum won't admit guilt... But we can twist tongues around stakes...</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_106"><text>Maybe I'll have a word with him? Find out what and how.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_107"><text>Yeah, chat away. Just don't bullshit me, got it? One more stiff means more for me... You dig?</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_108"><text>I dig.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_201"><text>Well, what? Had a chat?</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_2021"><text>Not yet, just looking around.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_2022"><text>Yeah. I think Nimble's telling the truth.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_203"><text>I don't give a damn! Where's the PDA? He'll tell me everything! Otherwise Borov will wrap my own guts around my mug and leave me hangin' on a branch.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_204"><text>I'll find out, go talk to someone who can help.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_205"><text>So what? I'm supposed to wait for you here? Do I need this? Now we'll have a smoke and deal with your Nimble... he'll say everything himself, no need to run around anywhere.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_206"><text>Well, wait a little bit more. He definitely didn't take your PDA, but I can search in the place where you saw Nimble. Just gotta make some inquiries first... An extra hour or two won't make a difference, and he's unlikely to tell you anything new anyway, but I'd quickly dash over and check everything. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_207"><text>Screw it with you. Get movin' then, but make it fast!</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_301"><text>Well what? Fo' real! Had a chat? Where's that PDA?</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_3021"><text>Be patient! We're looking! Think there'll be something!</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_3022"><text>Basically, found something there where Nimble was talking about.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_303"><text>Well where is it?!</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_3031"><text>Here it is, take it.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_3041"><text>A-a-ah!.. That's the one! Borov copied it just right! Well you're... Awesome in general! Here, take a bottle. And that rat-faced one, let him scram! Didn't wanna get our hands dirty. But if needed - we'll bury him! Tell him what got him lucky today.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_304"><text>Got a question.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_305"><text>Speak up, while I'm still in a good mood.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_306"><text>Borov - who's that? What's all the fuss about his beat-up PDA?</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_307"><text>Borov's our authority, big man. Consider that he holds the whole Zone in his fist. Everyone here owes him something. But he don't go overboard, follows the code. Right now our gang's settled in Dark Valley. If you're a stand-up guy, you'll find a way to get acquainted with Borov. And this PDA - he needs it and that's all. Now beat it, sickly.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_308"><text>Got it... I'll go make Nimble happy.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_401"><text>What else now? Beat it, while I'm still in a good mood.</text></string>
<string id="atp_bandit_leader_dialog_402"><text>Already beat it.</text></string>

<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_101"><text>What else now?</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_1021"><text>Hello. They call me Marked One. I'm from Wolf.</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_1031"><text>From Wolf? Listen, help me! These guys want some PDA from me, but I don't know anything about it! I swear!</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_1022"><text>Hello. They call me Marked One. I'm from Sidorovich.</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_1032"><text>From Sidor? Listen, help me! These guys want some PDA from me, but I don't know anything about it! I swear!</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_104"><text>Calm down, let's go in order: what happened?</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_105"><text>Right. So basically, I went to the Valley on business. Then decided to visit Sidor. Just passed the gas station in the Gut, I look - a boar carcass, but kinda dried up, and next to it something green, metallic. Watched from afar - quiet! Got closer and from the tracks understood that a bloodsucker "dried" it and apparently recently! I only had a PM and a simple knife, no chance against a bloodsucker. And the green metal turned out to be a box, with an almost knocked-off lid, slightly dented, looks like when the sucker grabbed the piglet, it knocked the box over, or the boar hit it with its hoof. Quickly looked - there's a jacket inside, with chainmail instead of lining. I tucked it under my arm and got out of there! Wanted to go through the tunnel first, but Dan the hunter got stubborn there - said he won't let me pass without providing a monster part! I spat and headed through the railway tunnel, where there's still a breach leading to the Sanatorium. As soon as I came out of that tunnel - the dogs started howling, and the village was already close! I dropped the jacket I found so it wouldn't get in the way, grabbed my feet and...</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_106"><text>What next?</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_107"><text>Just crossed the embankment, and here these guys caught me by the locomotive. Someone supposedly saw me hanging around the gas station in the Gut and found a jacket there. And there somewhere, turns out, there was a bandit stash. And in it a PDA with important information, only it went missing. Well, these guys think it's me now, like I stole it. I already told them everything honestly - never saw that PDA! They don't believe me, the bastards.</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_108"><text>Yeah. You're in deep, guy. You say you tried to negotiate with Dan first? Who's that?</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_109"><text>Dan? He heads up the hunters here. They set up recently near the tunnel that leads to the Gut. Say they're protecting Cordon from monsters, and demand all kinds of monster parts from passers-by, as proof that you're cleansing the Zone. A dirt road from ATP leads straight to them. Seems like a normal person, but too idealistic. Talk to Wolf, maybe he'll advise something.</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_110"><text>Alright, I'll try to talk to Wolf.</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_1092"><text>Dan? He kinda heads up the hunters here. They set up recently near the tunnel that leads to the Gut. Say they're protecting Cordon from monsters, and demand all kinds of monster parts from passers-by, as proof that you're cleansing the Zone. A dirt road from ATP leads straight to them. Seems like a normal person, but too idealistic. Talk to Sidorovich, maybe he'll advise something.</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_1102"><text>Alright, I'll try to talk to Sidorovich.</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_201"><text>Marked One?!...</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_2021"><text>Wait!</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_2022"><text>How are you here, alive? I found that crap these thugs lost.</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_203"><text>For the rest of my life! I thought - I'm done for! What next?</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_204"><text>What next? Grab your feet and... Ah! Sidor has a job...</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_205"><text>Shh! About the flash drive? Here it is. Take it. I'd rather not deal with Sidor for now, I lingered with the guys at the sawmill, they were celebrating someone's birthday there. They were distilling moonshine - amazing stuff. That's why they managed to catch me. But there's a bright side to this business. I overheard something about a way to transform artifacts. Maybe later I'll try to brew something. But for now - sleep! There's tons of sand in my eyes!</text></string>
<string id="esc_shustryi_prisoner_301"><text>Hello, friend!</text></string>

<string id="volk_prisoner_0"><text>I talked to Nimble.</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_1"><text>Is he free already? How's it going?</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_2"><text>Not yet. Here's the deal. The bandits say Nimble appropriated some important thing of theirs. In the Gut, supposedly he robbed some stash of theirs. Nimble himself says he didn't take anything, only found a jacket. Basically, I blurted out, without thinking, that I could dash over and check the place where they saw Nimble lurking around the bandit stash, but now I don't even know...</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_3"><text>In the Gut, you say? That's what we call the area to the east of here among ourselves. And where exactly was he prowling? The Gut's not small...</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_31"><text>Yeah he outlined it in general terms. Gas station... Where's that?</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_32"><text>Gas station? Pretty far. When you exit the tunnel - straight down the road, don't turn anywhere, you'll reach it.\nListen, Marked One, try to get there, eh? Look for this "important thing". It's not my business, but I hope you at least know what exactly to look for?\nI'll try to contact a mediator here. Maybe I can buy Nimble out. We don't abandon our own.\nOr we'll gather more guys and try to free him by storm. That's the worst option for all of us, as you understand...</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_41"><text>Running around somewhere else... Maybe we should storm it right now? I'm ready to help.</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_42"><text>You handle your own business, I don't want to get involved in this.</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_43"><text>Trek to the Gut? I'll give it a try, I guess...</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_53"><text>You know the road to the tunnel? It starts behind ATP. When you go past ATP itself - don't show yourself. Better go around it, just in case. If the thugs see you with weapons - they might go crazy. Basically, try to be quiet there, on tiptoes. Less chance to stir up mutants too.\nTake some money, you'll pay the hunters by the tunnel for passage if needed. Just don't try to throw your weight around.\nIn the Gut itself try to stick to the paved road, or at least don't stray far from it. Otherwise you'll catch radiation or end up as monster snacks. The road itself seems relatively clean. It was at least, last time.\nThat's it, go. Come back as soon as possible, who knows what those psychos might think up...</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_63"><text>Alright, I'll go around. And I'll hurry.</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_51"><text>Talk to Petruha. The situation's not very clear to me from here. Let him decide. Take some grenades. Just be careful there - don't hit our guys.</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_61"><text>Alright. Got it.</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_52"><text>Fine, beat it. What else to expect from a "passenger"...</text></string>
<string id="volk_prisoner_62"><text>What "passenger"?</text></string>

<string id="sidor_prisoner_0"><text>I talked to Nimble...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_1"><text>Really now? As I said - he was lying drunk somewhere? Did he bring the flash drive?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_2"><text>Not yet. Here's the deal. The bandits grabbed him, say he took some important device. In the Gut somewhere, in a stash. He says he only took some jacket. Basically, I don't know how to help him out.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_3"><text>In the Gut... That's what stalkers call the place to the east of here among themselves. But what specifically? And where? Did he say? The Gut's not small...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_31"><text>Yeah he outlined the place, gas station... Where's that?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_32"><text>Gas station? Not close... When you exit the tunnel - straight down the road, don't turn anywhere, you'll reach it.\nListen, Marked One, won't you dash to that gas station? Take a look at what's going on there. Maybe there'll be a clue at least.\nI'll try to contact a mediator here. Maybe I can buy out this fool.\nOr we'll gather more guys and try to free him by storm.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_41"><text>I can try to rescue Nimble.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_42"><text>You handle your own business, I don't want to get involved in this.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_43"><text>Trek to the Gut? I'll give it a try, I guess...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_53"><text>You know the road to the tunnel? Don't show yourself around ATP. Better go around just in case. If they see you with weapons - they'll go nuts. And you can't go there without weapons. Who knows what monsters you'll run into...\nWell go on. Try to be more careful there.\nDon't stray far from the road, radiation washed down there from the slopes, you'll step in it - you're done for, but the road seems clean. It was at least, as they said.\nCome back faster, who knows what and how things will be here...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_63"><text>Alright, I'll go around. And I'll hurry.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_51"><text>Alone? Hmm... Well try it. Main thing - secure that flash drive for me!</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_61"><text>Alright. Got it.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_52"><text>Hmm, well look... It's your business, of course. Don't be surprised later about what and how it turns out.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_prisoner_62"><text>Come on, don't scare me...</text></string>

<string id="yan_izm_semenov_0"><text>I'm about the measurements.</text></string>
<string id="yan_izm_semenov_11"><text>For the device, you mean? But I already gave it to you, forgot? Still haven't returned it to inventory, can't help with anything.</text></string>
<string id="yan_izm_semenov_12"><text>You've worn me out! I'm not going anywhere! What am I - the fall guy? Vlasyuk went - disappeared, Fedorov - disappeared, looks like snorks tore them apart. Kryukov dissolved completely in an anomaly and the newest protective suit didn't help. No money is worth dying here like a dog!</text></string>
<string id="yan_izm_semenov_21"><text>Right, I took it for measurements at Agroprom. Need to finish with this business first.</text></string>
<string id="yan_izm_semenov_22"><text>I'll go myself. Just give me the device and show me where to measure.</text></string>
<string id="yan_izm_semenov_3"><text>Yourself? What's wrong with your head? Well... Alright. Here's the device. You place it on the ground here, here and here, see? Just don't touch it until this light turns green and beeps. Clear?</text></string>
<string id="yan_izm_semenov_4"><text>Yeah, I'm off.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="rad_izm_start_0"><text>I'm about the "Brain Scorcher".</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_1"><text>"Brain Scorcher"? And what exactly do you need?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_2"><text>Barkeep sent me to you, said you'll tell me everything here. Here's a flash drive with scanned documents. Take a look.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_3"><text>Alright, let's see... What do we have here... Test run report, reports on changes made... This isn't complete information.\nAnd what's this? "Marks of death sites or presumed places where people go insane"... Who's such an eloquent fellow? Ah... Barkeep.\nJudging by everything, indeed, the radiation parameters are similar to those we have here at Yantar.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_4"><text>And how can you shut down this "Scorcher"?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_5"><text>My good man, how hasty you are - "shut down". First you need to get close to the central part of the "Scorcher" sphere. If we assume the basic parameters of the installation are identical, then the radiation should have brief periods of decline. We can only say for certain after getting measured values in direct proximity to the emitter's sphere of action. Better yet, even inside the sphere itself. Will you take on this job? Though I think only someone who completely doesn't value their life is capable of this.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_6"><text>And how do you conduct measurements inside the sphere of action? People go insane there, right?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_7"><text>Yes, they go insane, as far as I've heard. Based on tests conducted, we've developed a certain prototype that can temporarily protect a person from the emitter's effects. I won't explain the physical principles, I think they're useless to you. Actually, you won't have to measure anything. The necessary equipment is already installed - we don't just "drink tea" either, you know. Your task is to insert the power cell and start the device. After some time, remove the card with the measurement recording. The only thing you must firmly grasp - this prototype can protect you for a maximum of 25-30 minutes, and then desynchronization occurs and radiation breaks through. And since you won't have much time, you can even do this in two stages - first turn on, and collect the results later. Clear?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_8"><text>Clear. Thirty minutes and... that's it... Can I get this, what's it called, prototype?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_9"><text>Certainly. This thing is a protective suit, to be precise. Only, you understand, it's on our balance sheet. With you, no offense, anything could happen. I wouldn't want to explain to auditing inspectors where I put such expensive equipment. Therefore I'll ask you to leave as collateral any third-level artifact in perfect condition, or one of the dummy-class artifacts. Such will do in any degree of preservation. Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_10"><text>Agreed. I'll rummage through my stash.</text></string>

<string id="rad_izm_start2_0"><text>About the suit for the "Brain Scorcher".</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start2_1"><text>Excuse me? "Suit"? Ah! The suit with partial protection from the emitter. Yes-yes... You wanted to bring an artifact as collateral, I believe?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start2_21"><text>Yes, I have a 3rd level artifact.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start2_22"><text>I have a dummy-class one. Will it work?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start2_23"><text>I don't have such artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start2_3"><text>Good, take the suit. Just don't forget - protection for thirty minutes maximum! Better play it safe and count on twenty to twenty-five minutes. Don't forget to monitor time. Let me mark the places where we need measurements. Here, here and... here!\nThese are power cells. Nothing complicated there. Inserts simply, you won't make a mistake. Main thing is not to mix up polarity and don't forget to remove the recording card... Good luck!</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start2_4"><text>Three places. On Radar. What was I thinking...</text></string>

<string id="rad_izm_start3_0"><text>Had a mishap - the batteries disappeared.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start3_1"><text>Batteries? Which ones?\nAh! The ones meant for installation in the scanning oscillators? How did you manage that, my good man? I don't have a horn of plenty here either. Delivery of any equipment involves known risks. Again justification, reporting.\nWe have a few more pieces. But... What if these "disappear" too? I'd ask you to leave some artifact for them. No less than second level. Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start3_22"><text>Where else to go. Here, take it.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start3_23"><text>I don't have such artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start3_31"><text>Please don't take offense... Take the power cells, nothing complicated there - inserts simply, you won't make a mistake. Main thing is not to mix up polarity. And don't forget to remove the recording card... Good luck!</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start3_41"><text>I'm not offended. See you later.</text></string>

<string id="rad_izm_start4_0"><text>Can I get another special suit?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start4_1"><text>Special suit? The one that can protect from the "Brain Scorcher"? Hmm... What happened to the one I gave you? These are experimental samples, we have... Well, very few of them. Ready to issue you another one in exchange for a dummy-class artifact in perfect condition. Does that work?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start4_21"><text>Where else to go. Here, take it.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start4_22"><text>I don't have any dummies with me.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start4_3"><text>Oh! Curious specimen. Uh... Yes. Try not to lose this suit too, I ask you.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start4_4"><text>Of course. See you later.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="rad_izm_start_done_0"><text>I managed to get the measurement results in the "Brain Scorcher" area!</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_done_1"><text>Marked One, incredible! I understand that stalking doesn't tolerate weaklings, but still... How little must one value their life... Forgive me. I'm continuing a mental debate with one of my opponents. Where's the data?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_done_21"><text>The devices, in those places you indicated, gave me these cards. One each, total - three.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_done_22"><text>Data? Which? I turned on the devices, they started working...</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_done_31"><text>Yes-yes, those are the ones. I need to process what you brought. Let's see, let's see...</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_done_32"><text>Hmm... Yes. You see, dear fellow. Working devices save obtained data to removable media, colloquially - electronic memory cards. Those are what we need. All the necessary parameters are located there. Understand?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_done_41"><text>Wait! And how long will this take?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_done_42"><text>What? This? Trek back there again?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_done_51"><text>What? Ah... Don't worry, twenty minutes - no more. You can rest in the meantime. And I simply must reward you with something. Write down this artifact transformation method...</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_start_done_6"><text>Alright, I understand.</text></string>

<string id="rad_izm_done_0"><text>Well, how's it going with the "Brain Scorcher" data?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_done_11"><text>We processed the measurement results. Strange as it may seem, lately the "Brain Scorcher's" work rhythm is quite stable, and minimal risk </text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_done_12"><text>Marked One, you were told - twenty minutes.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_done_2"><text>Minimal risk?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_done_3"><text>Yes, at this time, plus-minus an hour, maybe hour and a half, when switching the emitter's operating modes, a safe "window" will guaranteed appear.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_done_4"><text>Plus-minus an hour or even hour and a half... Doesn't sound too convincing. Alright, I'll figure it out on site.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_done_5"><text>Marked One, since you're planning to risk yourself again, may I ask you for one favor? It would be right on your way.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_done_6"><text>I'm listening.</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_done_7"><text>Somewhere over Radar a helicopter crashed, aboard which was a group of our colleagues. The pilot went for an emergency landing and managed to safely land the aircraft. For some time we received a weak, distorted by interference, signal from the emergency beacon, but soon it disappeared. Several weeks have passed and I fully understand that hardly anyone could have survived, considering the specifics of the area where this incident occurred, but still... I'd like to reliably clarify the fate of the missing. If it's no trouble, could you look for their traces on Radar?</text></string>
<string id="rad_izm_done_8"><text>Oh, I don't even know. Only if I notice something along my route. I won't have time to specifically search for them.</text></string>
<string id="tex_rad_botans_article"><text>Sakharov asked me to find out the fate of a group of scientists whose helicopter made an emergency landing somewhere on Radar, if possible.</text></string>

<string id="zub_flash_marsh_glavn_dialog_0"><text>I got copies of scientific documents here, would you take a look?</text></string>
<string id="zub_flash_marsh_glavn_dialog_1"><text>I have a few minutes of free time. But why did you come to me specifically with this?</text></string>
<string id="zub_flash_marsh_glavn_dialog_2"><text>I understand they belonged to one scientist who possibly worked with you...</text></string>
<string id="zub_flash_marsh_glavn_dialog_3"><text>Is that so? Ah! Dr. Perelman's research. Interesting... So that's what he wanted our measuring device for, which, by the way, he still hasn't returned to this day... You see, Marked One, we involved Perelman in scientific work several times as an independent consultant, but our views on some issues differed radically and eventually we stopped cooperating, although we remained on good terms with him. However, I see that he made significant progress in collecting evidence base confirming one very promising theory. I admit, I'd be extremely curious to work with this data. Uh... You don't happen to know where their author is?</text></string>
<string id="zub_flash_marsh_glavn_dialog_4"><text>Seems he hastily left the Zone... Yeah, apparently flew somewhere. Judging by the fact that you weren't aware, asking whether you know anything about the guide Dr. Perelman worked with is pointless, yes?</text></string>
<string id="zub_flash_marsh_glavn_dialog_5"><text>Sorry, my good man, but I have no idea who you're talking about. Let's do this: since Perelman returned to the big land without returning valuable property to us, for which I, by the way, bear material responsibility, and didn't even bother to inform me of his departure, then I have full moral right to thoroughly familiarize myself with the results of his research. What do you think? What would you say if I asked you to give me this flash drive for appropriate compensation? I don't know what I could offer you though... Perhaps you'd be interested in a method of obtaining a modified artifact, which in our nomenclature goes under the code "KDB"?</text></string>
<string id="zub_flash_marsh_glavn_dialog_6"><text>Why not? Let at least someone benefit from this info, since I spent my time and money getting it. Agreed.</text></string>
<string id="zub_flash_marsh_glavn_dialog_71"><text>Wonderful! I understand that my proposal might have seemed not entirely ethical and therefore I'm glad you didn't resist. Now I'll transfer to your PDA a memo on converting one hypermodificate to absolute.</text></string>
<string id="zub_flash_marsh_glavn_dialog_72"><text>Wonderful! I understand that my proposal might have seemed not entirely ethical and therefore I'm glad you didn't resist. Now I'll transfer to your PDA a memo on converting one hypermodificate to absolute. And here, please accept as a gift some medical supplies from our stocks.</text></string>
<string id="zub_flash_marsh_glavn_dialog_8"><text>Thanks. Goodbye, Ivan Sergeyevich.</text></string>

<string id="escape_trader_strelok_flash_dialog_0"><text>Sidorovich, I came across this flash drive.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_strelok_flash_dialog_1"><text>Throw it away. I don't need junk.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_strelok_flash_dialog_2"><text>I'm not offering it. What do you think, if a flash drive's been lying around for a long time, can anything be read from it? Can you check what's on it for me? You've got a computer handy.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_strelok_flash_dialog_3"><text>Don't you get it? I said: don't need junk. And this isn't a computer, it's also junk - Chinese crap. Vergas looked at it, says some port burned out there. I also needed to urgently read a flash drive from Nimble - looked for it, but couldn't... Had to send a reliable messenger to the Swamps. So this isn't for me.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_strelok_flash_dialog_4"><text>Sorry, I wasn't aware.</text></string>

<string id="barman_strelok_flash_dialog_0"><text>I found a flash drive, can you look at what's on it.</text></string>
<string id="barman_strelok_flash_dialog_1"><text>I'm not interested in any small stuff.</text></string>
<string id="barman_strelok_flash_dialog_2"><text>I'm not offering it either. I'm just curious if everything that was on it is readable? How can I find out?</text></string>
<string id="barman_strelok_flash_dialog_3"><text>Go to Docent. He's our guy for this stuff. Just like little children! Show them everything and tell them everything. What's your own head for?</text></string>
<string id="barman_strelok_flash_dialog_4"><text>Don't grumble...</text></string>

<string id="docent_strelok_flash_dialog_0"><text>I have a flash drive here. Here it is.</text></string>
<string id="docent_strelok_flash_dialog_1"><text>Well it's a flash drive, so what? What do you need?</text></string>
<string id="docent_strelok_flash_dialog_2"><text>If you can - check if it's readable, and copy what's on it to my PDA...\nWhat would you take for such a trivial service?</text></string>
<string id="docent_strelok_flash_dialog_3"><text>What's there to charge for this... Let's see... So-so, seems visible... Some text in notepad... What kind of crap do you have here? You into Stephen King? Some nonsense, better read Simak...</text></string>
<string id="docent_strelok_flash_dialog_4"><text>What are you talking about?</text></string>
<string id="docent_strelok_flash_dialog_5"><text>Yeah, this crap of yours - some stories about crazy people... Don't understand what you found here. Anyway, I copied it to you, and I'm deleting it from mine, no time to read this crap...</text></string>
<string id="docent_strelok_flash_dialog_6"><text>Hmm... I thought there was something important there. So I was wrong, it's not his flash drive... Alright, I'll look through it and delete it too. Thanks.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_glavn_strelok_flash_dialog_0"><text>Ivan Sergeyich, I have this flash drive here.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_strelok_flash_dialog_1"><text>Flash drive, I see. And what?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_strelok_flash_dialog_2"><text>Maybe it's possible to read what's there and copy the data? I'll pay whatever's needed.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_strelok_flash_dialog_3"><text>What to charge you... Let's see - trivial matter... So. That's all, take it back. Hmm... what's this you have there, some kind of excerpt from medical history. Your case?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_strelok_flash_dialog_4"><text>What? I seem healthy... I found this flash drive, seemed to me it belonged to one person, but I thought it wasn't readable...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_strelok_flash_dialog_5"><text>Oh, sorry... And your person seems to be a psychiatrist or somehow connected to this field. Interested in this matter? It's your business, but with your permission I'll delete this - little space to store unnecessary records...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_strelok_flash_dialog_6"><text>No... I just wanted to look through it, then delete it myself... Thanks.</text></string>

<string id="yan_ecolog_strelok_flash_dialog_0"><text>I found this flash drive... Take a look?</text></string>
<string id="yan_ecolog_strelok_flash_dialog_1"><text>Hmm, and what do you want?</text></string>
<string id="yan_ecolog_strelok_flash_dialog_2"><text>Can you copy the contents to me from it, if it's readable, of course?</text></string>
<string id="yan_ecolog_strelok_flash_dialog_3"><text>I'll try... Yes, it's readable. Hmm... what brought you into such wilds? It seems to me your amnesia has nothing to do with this field.</text></string>
<string id="yan_ecolog_strelok_flash_dialog_4"><text>What field? I actually thought the flash drive belonged to one person important to me...</text></string>
<string id="yan_ecolog_strelok_flash_dialog_5"><text>The field of psychiatry. Who is this person to you?.. But actually, I won't pry into your soul. Here's the data, figure it out if you're interested, and I don't have time - I'm deleting this from mine.</text></string>
<string id="yan_ecolog_strelok_flash_dialog_6"><text>Psychiatry, you say... Yeah, probably I was wrong, it's not his flash drive...</text></string>

<string id="skryga_dibils_dialog_0"><text>You have a guy here who fell from the sky. Did he say anything coherent?</text></string>
<string id="skryga_dibils_dialog_1"><text>Did I interrogate him? They say he was mooing something. About like now. Who cared - there's plenty of psychos in the Zone...</text></string>
<string id="skryga_dibils_dialog_2"><text>Was he definitely naked?</text></string>
<string id="skryga_dibils_dialog_3"><text>Definitely. Like he just jumped out of a steam bath. Naked and red...</text></string>
<string id="skryga_dibils_dialog_4"><text>Hmm... interesting. I was just reading about a similar case recently. Maybe there's some connection...</text></string>

<string id="marsh_glavn_dibils_dialog_0"><text>Who's that wandering around your barracks?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_dibils_dialog_1"><text>Ah... don't pay attention. He's harmless. Lost something, can't find it.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_dibils_dialog_2"><text>And what did he lose?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_dibils_dialog_3"><text>Won't say. Just mutters something. Like some stone, meteorite fragment or something...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_dibils_dialog_4"><text>Hmm... interesting. I was just reading about a similar case recently. Maybe there's some connection...</text></string>

<string id="rad_botans_founded_0"><text>I saw one of yours there, on Radar.</text></string> 
<string id="rad_botans_founded_1"><text>One of ours? A fellow scientist? Yes-yes! I told you about the helicopter crash. They asked me to connect local resources to search for the missing. So did you find a survivor or... What about the others?</text></string>
<string id="rad_botans_founded_2"><text>Don't know about the others, but this one - Prikhodko was his surname - was alive at the time of our meeting, but... I couldn't get him out. He was seriously wounded, and time was pressing. I doubt he got out of there on his own afterward. And here's another strange thing: this scientist thought he was at Yantar. Maybe, of course, he lost his mind because of the "Scorcher", or maybe he wasn't from the helicopter at all.</text></string> 
<string id="rad_botans_founded_3"><text>Prikhodko? Vasily? But... how? He disappeared almost three months ago! Right in one of the insane attempts to break through to the control panel of the local installation. Where exactly did you find him? Can you describe the place?</text></string>
<string id="rad_botans_founded_4"><text>It was some technical room on the upper level of the overpass. Inside there was various equipment, of unknown purpose to me, and two doors. I first thought he got there through one of them, but it turned out they were completely blocked.\nOh, yes! Prikhodko asked me to give you these papers. Seemed it was important to him, since he was thinking about it on death's doorstep...</text></string>
<string id="rad_botans_founded_5"><text>Is that so? Curious... what do we have here? Hmm... Preservation leaves much to be desired. We'll have to scan and run through a special recognition program - otherwise can't make it out properly. If you don't mind, I'd ask you to come back in an hour and then we'll continue the conversation. Alright?</text></string>
<string id="rad_botans_founded_6"><text>Actually I'd... Ah, though, alright. In an hour, so in an hour.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_start_dlg_0"><text>How's it going, have you figured out Prikhodko's papers yet?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_start_dlg_11"><text>Partially. Some things, I'm afraid, we'll never be able to read, but... Marked One, didn't Vasily tell you where he got them?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_start_dlg_12"><text>Not so fast, Marked One. Be patient.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_start_dlg_2"><text>I explained to you, we didn't have time for chit-chat. I myself barely managed to slip through under the radiation...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_start_dlg_3"><text>Well, first, allow me to express our gratitude. Though we couldn't save our fellow scientist, you delivered very valuable documents. I'll immediately credit your special account, you'll be able to pick something to your taste from our exchange fund, if you wish.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_start_dlg_4"><text>Thanks. You said "first", what's second?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_start_dlg_5"><text>Second, I want to propose another risky venture to you, connected with visiting an underground complex located under the area called by stalkers the "Tesla" zone. In the papers it goes under index "X-6". Have you been there before?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_start_dlg_61"><text>In the bunker under "Tesla"? Been there. When I remember it, I shudder. And for what reason should I go there again?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_start_dlg_62"><text>Not yet, but something tells me sooner or later my searches might lead there too.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_start_dlg_63"><text>Wait, stop! I'll refuse right away before I hear anything unnecessary. No offense, professor, but I'm quite tired of all these "risky ventures" that don't bring me closer to my main goal at all, but rather the opposite, just make me waste time.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_start_dlg_71"><text>You see, I didn't ask you about the origin of Vasily Prikhodko's documents without reason. Can't figure out how they got to him, but apparently they were originally supposed to be in the underground laboratory I mentioned. I know that some such complexes are connected by a whole network of tunnels, so it's quite possible there's no mysticism here. Now to the main point. The documents are almost entirely devoted to the laboratory's material and technical base. Among other things, data storage devices for conducted research are indicated. According to emergency protocols that must have gone into effect when the Zone appeared, all information was subject to destruction or removal. However, something could have remained on personal devices of employees, which security confiscated at the end of the work day and placed in a special safe. Its code is known - No..... Your task - find it and deliver the contents to us. Can you handle it? As a reward I'll share with you one little-known method of converting a rare artifact.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_start_dlg_72"><text>Well, all the better. You'll kill two birds with one stone right away. So, to the essence.\nI didn't ask you about the origin of Vasily Prikhodko's documents without reason.

<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_start_dlg_8"><text>Do I even need this? Though... rummaging around such places one more time can be useful. I've dragged so much stuff from various dungeons. I agree.</text></string>
<string id="tex_labx6_note_article"><text>Sakharov promises to tell about a little-known method of converting some rare artifact if I bring him the contents of a safe from the bunker under "Tesla", whose code is - No.....</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_done_dlg_0"><text>I searched the underground at your request... The one under "Tesla". Supposedly "X-6", right?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_done_dlg_1"><text>Exactly so. Did you find the safe? Manage to open it? I admit, I had some concerns regarding the relevance of information gleaned from those documents...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_done_dlg_2"><text>As always, it's pleasant to learn about such "concerns" after the fact. Fortunately for you, they weren't confirmed. The safe was found, and the code fit. And here's what was inside.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_done_dlg_3"><text>That's what we were fighting for, as they say. You did excellent work, Marked One! If I'm not mistaken, I promised to help you with artifact conversion, right? Sending data to your PDA.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_labx6_note_done_dlg_4"><text>Call on us again.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_glavn_vasilev_founded_0"><text>Ivan Sergeyich, I told you about Professor Vasilev, remember? He was found.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_vasilev_founded_1"><text>Yes-yes, they already informed me. Sad story...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_vasilev_founded_2"><text>I wanted to ask, what would happen if, let's say, a person was thrown back in time? Could it be that he'd lose his mind... Well or memory?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_vasilev_founded_3"><text>Hmm. The very possibility of traveling through time is already on the border of fantasy, and if we also fantasize about what would happen to a person, then we'll pile up such nonsense...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_vasilev_founded_4"><text>Well still. You must have some thoughts about this... As a scientist.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_vasilev_founded_5"><text>How to say... Time is a mysterious phenomenon. But I suppose, whatever time is, it's deeply woven into ourselves. All of us have a built-in "clockwork" with its own course. For some reason I'm sure that if even slightly these internal clocks desynchronize with the real course of time - this could lead to serious mental disorder. I think that schizophrenia at its core might have a disturbance of time perception. Imagine that you don't understand whether your actions happen before or after you feel them. The result of such deviation would be fragmentation in the ability to cognize, you wouldn't know what your actions caused and what they didn't. A person performs an action and says, it wasn't me, I don't remember doing this... Such thoughts.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_vasilev_founded_6"><text>So memory loss could also be a time lapse... Or schizophrenia?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_vasilev_founded_7"><text>I understand your concern. In your case, most likely not. After all, then you'd remember things in fragments... And you, as far as I know, have memory that's... how to put it... Like it was cut off from a certain moment.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_vasilev_founded_8"><text>Well yes... And if suddenly there's another lapse, and I'll remember in fragments? Could this serve as a sign... Professor, is schizophrenia treatable at all?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_vasilev_founded_9"><text>Don't be so paranoid. From everything I can see, you're quite mentally healthy... Just, there's some amnesia, and its causes are unknown. I think it's temporary.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_vasilev_founded_10"><text>Yeah right... You really "cheered" me up. Let's hope...</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_back_to_memory_0"><text>Professor, tell me, if a person lost their memory, can it be restored somehow?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_back_to_memory_1"><text>Hmm... Young man, this isn't my field at all, but as far as I know, no one can give you a definitive answer. It all depends on many factors. What are your symptoms? What do you remember at all?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_back_to_memory_2"><text>Little by little something surfaces from the past, most often about places where I've been before. Sometimes I remember some secrets, peculiarities, but the main thing keeps slipping away, and there are strange dreams, as if from another life.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_back_to_memory_3"><text>It seems to me you either came under a controller's influence, or didn't manage to hide from an emission. Or possibly the cause was an event before your appearance in the Zone at all. To restore memory, remember even insignificant details. Try to analyze and understand your dreams. Our subconscious, you know, stores answers to many questions that are inaccessible to normal perception, but can be interpreted through the prism of dreams.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_back_to_memory_4"><text>Really? I sometimes dream of a shining black stone and a person trying to reach it with his hand... I've heard stories about the Monolith, of course, but what could such a thing mean to dream about periodically?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_back_to_memory_51"><text>Most likely these are just "echoes" of those stories, though... who knows, who knows. Remember the story about the helicopter that crashed in Dark Valley? You brought documents and a container found at the crash site. So, in the container was transported a unique anomalous formation, one of its working names - "Pendulum". The accompanying documents claim that it's a kind of "conductor" for connecting living biosystems with an external information field. With its help one can try to connect to the noosphere, to a certain "supercomputer", if you will, storing imprints of thoughts and memory of all currently living, and all ever-living intelligent beings. By the way, several of my, so to speak, "colleagues" suggested that the very Monolith is nothing other than an entrance gateway or access terminal to the "supercomputer" I mentioned. Of course, all this in a metaphysical sense. You shouldn't take my words literally, as if somewhere in the Zone you can find a screen with a keyboard, type a command and get omniscience or something like that.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_back_to_memory_52"><text>Most likely these are just "echoes" of those stories, though... who knows, who knows. There are such special anomalous formations, they're also called "Pendulums". There's a hypothesis that they are a kind of "conductors" for connecting living biosystems with an external information field. With the help of a "Pendulum" one can try to connect to the noosphere, to a certain "supercomputer", if you will, storing imprints of thoughts and memory of all currently living, and all ever-living intelligent beings.

<string id="sakharov_back_to_memory_6"><text>My head's spinning from all these complexities. Tell me straight, Professor, is there any practical benefit for my situation in what you told me?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_back_to_memory_7"><text>I won't give you false hope. All this looks more like fairy tales from science charlatans, but not like conscientiously done research work. Perhaps, if you managed to get the artifact we talked about - "Pendulum", we could conduct a series of experiments with your participation... Even then, serious preparation is needed, which would require additional costs of both time and resources. We're unlikely to go for such a thing in the near future, but the idea itself is perhaps worth attention and I won't forget about you, my dear fellow.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_back_to_memory_8"><text>But surely you don't have a suitable artifact right now? After all, I could even buy it from you or trade for something.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_back_to_memory_9"><text>That's just it, we don't. These anomalous formations are very rare and it seems inappropriate to me to use specimens obtained with such difficulty for experiments of an openly adventurous nature.</text></string>

<string id="vergas_razgruzka_0"><text>I see many people have tactical vests? Where can you get one?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_razgruzka_1"><text>Well... It's not such a scarce item. Some trade with soldiers, others buy from traders. And take them from bodies, naturally. Sometimes they bring them for repair or give as payment for services. I've got a couple lying around. Not special forces quality, of course, and they're used, but still quite decent.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_razgruzka_2"><text>Maybe you'll share?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_razgruzka_3"><text>I'll share, not for free, of course. Got money in your account? I'll give it for twenty thousand. Almost for nothing...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_razgruzka_41"><text>Twenty? You're asking too much. But alright - here, take it.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_razgruzka_43"><text>I don't have that kind of money...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_razgruzka_51"><text>Well, it's not that much... A tactical vest saves lives, and that's much more valuable than a measly twenty, right? Here, take it. Don't mind that it's patched and stained, at least the pocket clasps don't jam...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_razgruzka_61"><text>Alright, thanks.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_razgruzka_71"><text>Don't mention it. Drop by if you need anything.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_razgruzka_42"><text>Twenty? You're asking too much. I don't even have anything...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_razgruzka_52"><text>Well it's not that much... A tactical vest saves lives, and that's much more valuable than a measly twenty, right? Alright, as a fellow unfortunate - ten. Final word.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_razgruzka_62"><text>Agreed, here's the money.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_razgruzka_72"><text>Here, take it. Don't mind that it's patched and stained, at least the pocket clasps don't jam...</text></string>

<string id="val_robs_start_dialog_1011"><text>Hey there, pal. You here to see us? Come to the fire.</text></string>
<string id="val_robs_start_dialog_1012"><text>Don't wave that gun around, relax - everyone here's friendly...</text></string>
<string id="val_robs_start_dialog_1013"><text>How's life? Sit down, let's chat...</text></string>
<string id="val_robs_start_dialog_1014"><text>You should go your own way.</text></string>

<string id="val_robs_start_dialog_1016"><text>I don't know you somehow. Newbie? Where from, where to, what for?</text></string>
<string id="val_robs_start_dialog_10211"><text>Hey, I'm just here for a minute.</text></string>
<string id="val_robs_start_dialog_10221"><text>Friendly? Yeah right...</text></string>
<string id="val_robs_start_dialog_10231"><text>No time for me. Though... Maybe I'll sit down...</text></string>
<string id="val_robs_start_dialog_10241"><text>I'll leave when I need to.</text></string>
<string id="val_robs_start_dialog_10251"><text>Already left, smartass.</text></string>
<string id="val_robs_start_dialog_10261"><text>You work for the authorities? Report to him...</text></string>
<string id="val_robs_start_dialog_10213"><text>Oh! You're Vlad?</text></string>
<string id="val_robs_start_dialog_110"><text>Well, I am, seems like we've met already...</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_1_0"><text>Ivan Sergeyevich, were you acquainted with Professor Vasilev?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_1_1"><text>Vladimir Valentinovich? Of course, I know him. He somehow greatly supported one of my wild ideas at a symposium. There was a lot of noise, but I think we managed to defend our point of view... He works on a similar problem, only goes a somewhat different way... More radical, if you will...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_1_2"><text>Did he discuss anything with you about laboratory X-16, the one at Yantar?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_1_3"><text>Mmm... There was something, I don't recall what exactly. Why do you need this?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_1_4"><text>I need to get there. I can't properly explain why right now. But I have information that Vasilev specifically knew how to penetrate there.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_1_5"><text>Wait, wait... We once had a purely theoretical conversation about interesting anomalies in different points of the Zone, at Yantar including. Someone suggested... I don't remember... that their intensity might somehow be connected with psi-radiation intensity. This radiation, you know, isn't constant in nature, but changes all the time, so we have to periodically take measurements to identify some pattern of changes. Ah, yes! Dr. Petrov suggested this. He told about his very interesting expedition through the Zone and about conclusions regarding psi-radiation correlation with various functions. So, according to his conclusions, no connection is observed, complete chaos, from which it's clear to understand... Uh... I got distracted, sorry. So what about Yantar?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_1_6"><text>Nothing good so far... Professor Vasilev disappeared somewhere, no one knows how to penetrate X-16, Sakharov doesn't want to spare people for this. I thought you should have known something, since you already had such a conversation. Well then, I'll have to go to Dr. Petrov. Better talk with him then.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_1_71"><text>To my great regret, Petrov recently died. He was conducting research in sector 82. Stalkers call this area "the Gut". And about the conversation, you're right, I remembered that about half a year ago I even jotted down some thoughts about these "variable" wandering anomalies. I'll rummage through my notes, in the computer, maybe a draft remained. And regarding laboratory X-16, somewhere there should be a transcript of our conversation with Dr. Petrov on this topic. Come back in half an hour.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_1_72"><text>He conducts research in sector 82. "The Gut", that's what stalkers call this area. He wasn't at our base for long. He had some problems - his recent measurement records disappeared, well and... financial difficulties. I helped him a little...\nAnd about the conversation, you're right, I remembered that about half a year ago I even jotted down some thoughts about these "variable" wandering anomalies. I'll rummage through my notes, in the computer, maybe a draft remained. Come back in half an hour...\nMeanwhile, if it's no trouble, go to our supply manager. I asked him to put together a little package for Petrov. Want to treat my colleague. You're planning to visit him anyway.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_1_81"><text>Got it. Won't bother you.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_1_821"><text>I'll go meet your supply manager. See you later, Ivan Sergeyevich.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_1_822"><text>Then I'm off to Pakhom. See you later, Ivan Sergeyevich.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_2_0"><text>Did you search for the drafts, find anything?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_2_11"><text>No, haven't gotten to it yet. Come back a bit later.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_2_21"><text>Alright.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_2_12"><text>Something, I don't know if this will give you anything... I'm afraid I gave this draft of mine to the guide along with other notes... Oh, by the way! I've become quite absent-minded and missed what you said last time about Professor Vasilev. Where is he?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_2_2"><text>I said he disappeared somewhere, and no one knows where. Most likely, he went to that very laboratory.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_2_3"><text>Hmm... what strange coincidences. Dr. Petrov said that his graduate student saw Professor Vasilev in completely the wrong place and at the wrong time, where he could physically be. The graduate student, of course, could have confused something himself, but the thing is, he also disappeared. A group of three employees left and all vanished. How much time has passed without any word from them. I asked stalkers to help, organized a search, but no results so far. And now you say Vasilev disappeared. Very strange disappearances...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_2_4"><text>The Zone, one word... So what about your notes?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_no_entry_x16_2_5"><text>Yes-yes... Here, please. Might be a bit chaotic, but these are just small notes, more precisely a draft of notes, and not everything at that. What I can offer, don't judge harshly... What? Not what you expected? Probably I gave those notes to the guide after all...</text></string>
<!-- Петров умер -->
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_x16_dialog_0"><text>About X-16, is there something?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_x16_dialog_1"><text>According to Dr. Petrov, Vasilev mentioned in his last message that a certain stalker with a strange handle - Ghost - told him about it. There exists a method of instantaneous controlled transfer through space, and possibly time. For this, simultaneous activation of three unique artifacts is necessary. A scheme was given for teleportation two-three meters in the direction of Earth's center. In my opinion - very, very dangerous experiments.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_x16_dialog_2"><text>Dangerous, that's for sure. What artifacts? Didn't mention?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_x16_dialog_3"><text>These are artifacts of the so-called "emerald" group. "Wrenched", "Jellyfish" and "Stone Blood". Testing this hypothesis probably won't be possible - these artifacts are too rare.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_x16_dialog_4"><text>Probably it was still possible, since Vasilev and those who were with him managed to get into this mysterious underground laboratory... And where is it located? Specific place?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_x16_dialog_5"><text>Hmm... According to Petrov's story, Vasilev was sure he knew. Even marked it on the map for him. Here, in the basement of this building at the Yantar factory. Mark it for yourself, if you're interested.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_x16_dialog_6"><text>In the basement? And you say another two-three meters toward Earth's center, where could it get any lower? And how to use these "emeralds"? Maybe throw them on the ground or arrange in a triangle?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_x16_dialog_7"><text>I think you shouldn't engage in magic and build triangles from artifacts. I suppose the method of application is somehow simple, obvious... Stalkers use homemade belts for carrying artifacts, though they don't even understand what this might lead to. Try hanging them on a belt. Only I don't advise mindlessly experimenting with such dangerous things. If you do decide, then only at the indicated point, or God knows where you might end up.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_general_ecolog_x16_dialog_8"><text>Yes, dangerous, of course. But need to check. "Emerald" artifacts, then... three pieces. Hmm, this means I need a belt for three artifacts... We'll search.</text></string>

<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_start_0"><text>Professor, I found a document in the Swamps, only it's hard to understand. Take a look?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_start_1"><text>Let's see, let's see. Hmm... amusing. I'll study these materials a bit. Come back in some time, alright? A few hours, I hope, will be enough for me.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_start_2"><text>As you say.</text></string>

<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_0"><text>I'm about the notes from the Swamps.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_111"><text>Come back a bit later.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_112"><text>I familiarized myself with the records. A collection of graphomaniacal scribbles - that's how I'd evaluate what I read, but to be fair, there are several places worthy of attention. For example, some reasoning about the nature of the Zone and the part where it talks about so-called "Pendulums". Are you sure you really want to cram your head with scientific theories?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_21"><text>Well, alright.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_22"><text>Would be curious to listen. We already talked about "Pendulums", remember? Only, if possible, without your scientific complexities. Simpler, for "dummies", as they say.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_3"><text>To tell the truth, overall I don't share the views expressed in the essays you brought. Though something definitely deserves attention and coincides with my conclusions. There are quite a few fantasies in the records, but to put it simply, there's a supposition that in some places of the Zone under certain conditions, for certain actions, you can get a specific response. That is, by doing something, get a reaction back. Everything is built around theorizing that through experience one can establish such a combination of factors, the reaction to which could be partial disappearance of Zone manifestations, or even the entire Zone altogether. The probability of such an event seems vanishingly small to me personally, though I agree that an insignificant reaction is possible, at least in the form of an energy impulse...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_4"><text>This is called simpler? I seem to have grasped the essence, but what do "Pendulums" have to do with it? They give the possibility to get a response, yes?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_5"><text>If I knew the exact answer, I'd surely already have received an invitation to the annual reception from the London Royal Society... I already told you that all this is extremely speculative and doesn't even qualify as theory. Hypothesis - at most. But we can reason a bit in this direction, since there is some grain of truth here. Take you, for instance. You supposedly have partial memory loss, right? Something like retrograde amnesia. Suppose you really want to remember something. And suppose you find yourself in such a place where your... uh... mental impulse, message, your intention to remember, can be somehow structured and transmitted to some addressee in the form of an abstract info-packet. Transmitted to whom? Well, at least to that same Monolith. We already talked about this: noosphere and Monolith as a connection point to it... So, if following the law of energy conservation, one can expect that by sending a certain energy charge with an info-packet query, you can get back an identical charge in characteristics, but already with different content - an answer, response.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_6"><text>It's that simple? Mentally asked a question and got an answer, that's all?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_7"><text>What are you saying, young man, of course not! Here it's very important to correctly select... let's call it a query key or password, if such analogy is more understandable to you. Consequences from incorrectly formulated query, as well as wrongly selected key, can be completely unpredictable. Perhaps something has long been answering us with mutant waves, uncontrolled psi-field, emissions, spatial anomalies and God knows what else, precisely because we literally can't find a common language with this entity.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_8"><text>And how do we find it, do you have ideas? And I also didn't quite understand about Zone disappearance or its manifestations due to response. How is such a thing even possible? You yourself mentioned the law of energy conservation...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_9"><text>I'll answer the second question first, with your permission. I didn't say for nothing that the probability of such outcome seems to me if not zero, then close to it. The author of notes provides some curious data about peculiarities of "Pendulums", particularly about periodicity of properties they manifest, about phases. Considering continuous growth of information entropy of the Zone as a dynamic system, and accepting on faith that Monolith actually serves as a "terminal" for communication with it by the same principle as with noosphere, "Pendulum", due to its properties, can act as the strongest resonator. Purely hypothetically, this way one can "shake" and unbalance all Zone systems to such degree that they, transitioning to non-equilibrium state, will partially cease to influence our familiar world, or even completely lose integrity. And everything would be fine, if not for one very significant "but". Even quite approximate approximation shows that the level of energy costs necessary for successful realization of such plan exceeds by several times all combined capacities available on the continent.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_10"><text>Holy shit! Seems this method is indeed from the realm of fantasy. What about my first question?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_11"><text>Here everything is both simpler and more complex at the same time. Data available to us about "Pendulums", as well as confirming information gleaned from notes you brought, allow us to assume with high probability that the ideal key in your situation could be the anomalous field that created this artifact - "Labyrinth". Have you encountered such phenomena before? We classify them as fourth-order wandering anomalies...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_12"><text>Stop, stop! Are you saying I'll have to climb into an anomaly or what?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_13"><text>Uh... that's exactly the complex part of such a plan. Not just into the anomaly, but into its epicenter. Right there, as calculations show, the chance of getting the response you need is highest. However, there's nothing impossible in this. The zones of space nonlinearity that fill most of the "Labyrinth" have gaps. With certain skill, good protective equipment and a bit of luck, getting to the anomaly's center won't be such a difficult task. And there, having a "Pendulum" with you, it will be enough to concentrate well and carefully formulate your mental "query", that is, the desire to remember some time period from your life.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_14"><text>Sounds like pure magic. And what else can be "requested" this way? Maybe it'll be possible to make a wish to the Monolith, so to speak, remotely? Would be amusing...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_15"><text>Jokes aside, but I suppose this is far from the only way available to us for interaction using "Pendulums", both with information environments in general and the Zone entity in particular. Oh, I see huge potential in these artifacts! Of course, provided that all these hypotheses are at least partially confirmed.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_16"><text>Professor, I was just thinking... could there be such a response that... how to say... wouldn't add knowledge, but on the contrary - take it away?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_17"><text>Hmm... why not? Even slight electromagnetic influence on certain brain areas can lead to "erasing" information stored there. Do you suppose something similar happened to you?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_18"><text>After your stories, I'd start supposing even stranger things. And in general... I don't know. How would I have known before everything you just told me? Or... someone else knew and decided to conduct a live experiment on me?! Damn, you can think up anything! Either way, if nothing else helps me restore my memory, I might quite possibly risk trying this method with the "Pendulum". If only I could get the artifact itself?! You don't happen to know, maybe there exists a recipe for brewing... uh... transformation - that's the correct scientific term? - of this type?</text></string>

We cooperate quite closely with him and he was just recently interested in this topic too. As for the artifact, though it's against my rules, I can offer for these purposes the specimen you delivered to us along with documents from Dark Valley. But not before we finish our planned research with it.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleport_docs_end_200"><text>Thanks for that. An informative conversation. Goodbye.</text></string>

<string id="saharov_4_entry_x16_0"><text>Professor, I found out how to penetrate X-16.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_4_entry_x16_11"><text>Really? And how?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_4_entry_x16_12"><text>Your professor, Petrov, says you can use three emerald artifacts and they can somehow teleport a person several meters down. And even marked a point - where, which Vasilev himself supposedly indicated to him.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_4_entry_x16_1"><text>Well, well... Interesting... And you're planning to test this?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_4_entry_x16_2"><text>I am, but it's kind of scary. What if there's no laboratory there, where would I fall then? And how would I get out?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_4_entry_x16_3"><text>Reasonable concerns. Where exactly did you say this place is? Aha... well, with high probability we can say there should be more levels below this point... There is risk, of course. But anyway, it's up to you to decide, but I'm curious myself to see how you'll get down there...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_4_entry_x16_4"><text>I might get there. But how do I get out?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_4_entry_x16_5"><text>If there really are underground facilities, they must have an exit and even more than one. Possibly even not in the Yantar area... After all, if Professor Vasilev entered the same way you're planning to, he somehow got out.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_4_entry_x16_6"><text>Well yeah... got out he did, but where is he now? Risky, of course...</text></string>

<string id="saharov_teleports_dialog_0"><text>Professor, I have some more interesting notes here, from Ivan Sergeyevich. Take a look...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleports_dialog_1"><text>Let's take a look... So. Ah, well I'm already familiar with this hypothesis. We discussed this once with... wait, with whom? Well yes, with Dr. Petrov. He somehow latched onto it, even got funding for an experiment. Rather dubious idea...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleports_dialog_2"><text>What's the essence? Something about teleports there. I understood little, though I know some stalkers somehow manage to use them...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleports_dialog_3"><text>One locksmith at our institute also somehow managed to use an incredibly expensive newest microscope for lack of a hammer at hand...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleports_dialog_4"><text>Yeah, as they manage... So what's the theory, something interesting?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleports_dialog_5"><text>Don't bother with it, young man. Well if you want... Uh, how to explain... The essence is that when something enters our world from outside, the space-time continuum might somehow get stirred up. Like a pebble thrown into calm water creates a splash and subsequent waves. Most likely it will be a microsplash, but the probability of stable oscillations and even subsequent resonance isn't excluded.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleports_dialog_6"><text>Too complicated for me...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_teleports_dialog_7"><text>You asked for it yourself. To put it briefly, these reflections lead to an unpleasant conclusion: won't these microdeviations in time and space eventually become so large that they'll influence cause-and-effect relationships in our world so much that... it's even hard to imagine what will happen to our world. According to these assumptions, the probability of such outcome turns out to be quite large... Personally, I didn't like the groundless fear-mongering and prediction of some apocalypse in this hypothesis. It looks more like some mysticism rather than a scientific hypothesis. So sleep peacefully.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_matveev_dialog_0"><text>I saw one of yours there, in the tunnels under the laboratory.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_matveev_dialog_1"><text>Ours? Who? Is there still someone left there? Alive?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_matveev_dialog_2"><text>Yes, still alive... Matveev is his surname.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_matveev_dialog_3"><text>Vladimir? Did you come out with him? Where is he? How is he? We thought he died together with Vasilev. Why are you silent?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_matveev_dialog_4"><text>He's not quite himself and also wounded, possibly shell-shocked. I couldn't get him out alone. You understand, not in that place.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_matveev_dialog_5"><text>Too much extraordinary stuff is happening here... The Zone... The more we try to understand what it is, the more we get tangled up. It seems - there's already a thread to understanding, but it leads into such wilds that human logic can't accept... \nCan I ask you for another favor? Would you agree to return there, to Vladimir, and mark his location with a special beacon? We're expecting a group of people prepared for such situations any moment, and they'll be able to get him out of there.\nWell, and we'll find something to thank you with.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_matveev_dialog_61"><text>Hmm, no. I think your people won't get lost. The entrance is there, behind the lake.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_matveev_dialog_71"><text>Well, expecting humanity from a stalker. Yeah. You've already done a lot, you can go...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_matveev_dialog_62"><text>Well. I'll try. In principle, it's not that far...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_matveev_dialog_72"><text>Huge thanks to you! Take this beacon device. Using it is extremely simple, press the button and that's it... Thanks again.</text></string>

<string id="hunters_toz_stalker_dialog_2041"><text>Here, a couple good artifacts... Take them.</text></string>
<string id="hunters_toz_stalker_dialog_2042"><text>I have a very good artifact here. I'm giving it.</text></string>
<string id="hunters_toz_stalker_dialog_2051"><text>Hmm. Alright. Will do. I hid that little rifle in a stash. In the railway bridge watchman's house. Well, the one at the turn from the main road to the dirt road that leads to our sawmill. Behind the little sofa there's a chest that's still quite sturdy, shoved that junk in there...</text></string>
<string id="hunters_toz_stalker_dialog_2052"><text>Hmm. Alright. Will do. I hid that little rifle in a stash. Heard about the regional committee dacha? Well not far from here - east of our sawmill. I was hiding in the attic there, waiting for the zombies to calm down. That's where I put this thing in a little box...</text></string>
<string id="hunters_toz_stalker_dialog_2053"><text>Hmm. Alright. Will do. I hid that little rifle in a stash. Not far from the tunnel that leads to Cordon, on the road in a bus I was hiding from boars. That's where I wrapped this piece of crap in an old backpack...</text></string>
<string id="hunters_toz_stalker_dialog_2054"><text>Hmm. Alright. Will do. I hid that little rifle in a stash. During a thunderstorm I spent the night in the tunnel that's behind the gas station. You know about the gas station, right? Well there. I wrapped this relic in an old jacket and shoved it under a rock. Probably still lying there...</text></string>
<string id="hunters_toz_stalker_dialog_206"><text>I'll try to find it. Hope I won't have to come back - to beat your face in...</text></string>
<string id="hunters_toz_stalker_dialog_301"><text>Hello. How's it going?</text></string>

<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_0"><text>There's interest in you. They say you fly around the Zone instead of walking. You're everywhere, get everything done... How do you manage it?</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_1"><text>They say a lot of things... They say your face is like that because you're too curious, ask too many questions...</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_2"><text>Easy there! Or some birds will get their beaks bent... I'm talking to you stalker-style, like a normal man... Maybe I want to be everywhere too. So what's your secret?</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_3"><text>Secrets cost money...</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_4"><text>How much?</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_5"><text>Oh! Perked up right away. Now I'll write down for you right here on paper... Sparrow's hu-u-uge secret. Ha! That's it, bro, Sparrow's done, no longer flies, crawls like everyone else. He has no secrets left...</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_6"><text>How's that?</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_7"><text>How-how... I had this chemistry, some Chinese stuff. An acquaintance supplied it - also one of the "flyers". And recently he flew into an anomaly, and took the secret of where he got the chemistry with him. So that's it - I would've shown you my high flight, but you're too late.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_81"><text>Yeah. Too bad...</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_82"><text>Here, look. I have some Chinese stuff. Seems to be medicine...</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_83"><text>Chinese chemistry? I've come across some bottles with hieroglyph inscriptions. Maybe that's it? Where did I put them? I'll bring them, then we'll talk more.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_93"><text>Bro! You'll save me - I'll be grateful! I'm burning up!..</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_92"><text>Opa! That's the one, darling! Give it here, quickly...</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_10"><text>Wait, why are you reaching out your paws. Look how your little hands are shaking. Tell me first what you do with this.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_11"><text>Well... this... Just give it to me, I'll show you. You'll see everything yourself now... Come on, faster! I have no strength left to endure...</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_12"><text>Whoa, guy! You're hooked on chemistry, I see. Here you go. Show me, but don't spill it, watch out.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_13"><text>Right now, right now... we take an energy drink, drink a little and add exactly... sixteen drops. Now salt it a bit, shake it up and! Ahhh, good...</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_14"><text>Uh...</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_15"><text>Wait! Let's be quiet for a bit, or you'll scare away the high... That's it... it's going through the system... So! For demonstrating the secret, I'm taking the rest of the bottle from you. Will last another week. And... give me everything you have.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_16"><text>Hold on! Dream on! Look how your eyes lit up... There's nothing else. But I'll come by if I find more. We'll make a deal.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_17"><text>Bring it! I'll take everything! Good price.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_1_dialog_18"><text>Later. Junkie...</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_2_dialog_0"><text>Suffering? I'm about the Chinese bottles.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_2_dialog_1"><text>Not suffering... Dying. What do you have there?</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_2_dialog_21"><text>Uh, nothing much. See ya...</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_2_dialog_22"><text>Here, look. I have some Chinese stuff. Nobody knows what it is or what for...</text></string>

<string id="vorobey_energetik_end_dialog_0"><text>Will you buy the mixture? What do you offer?</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_end_dialog_1"><text>Well, I have a bunch of small stuff and some other things...</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_end_dialog_21"><text>Alright, give me the cash, I'll stock up at the bar.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_end_dialog_22"><text>Grenades will come in handy, take your booze.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_end_dialog_23"><text>Nah, I'll keep it for myself for now, might be useful.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_end_dialog_31"><text>Deal, take the cash... If there's more - come by, we'll make a deal.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_energetik_end_dialog_32"><text>Deal, here are the little grenades... If there's more mixture - come by, we'll make a deal.</text></string>

<string id="lim_energetik_1_dialog_0"><text>I found Sparrow after all. And learned his "secret".</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_1_dialog_1"><text>Well?! Tell me - what's there, how is it?</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_1_dialog_2"><text>Basically, there's no special secret. Sparrow mixes some chemistry with an energy drink, and that supposedly gives him strength. He runs around a bit, then needs to refuel again. He can't do without it anymore - he's a drug addict, in short. I doubt there'll be any benefit from this for stalkers. He'll burn out his body soon... already looks bad - pale as death, with circles under his eyes.</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_1_dialog_3"><text>Bah, bah, bah... may you be empty! Don't mention the bony one in this house... And what kind of chemistry?</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_1_dialog_4"><text>Some Chinese crap.</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_1_dialog_5"><text>Do you have it with you? Well then give it here... let's try it.</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_1_dialog_51"><text>Here, brought with me... a sample.</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_1_dialog_61"><text>I had it, might have dropped it on the way. I won't be long, wait, I'll bring it.</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_1_dialog_52"><text>It's a small bottle. Maybe you'll try it. Eh? Here's a snack too.</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_1_dialog_6"><text>Listen, Mikhalych, I'm not going to try this. And don't stray from the topic. You asked me to find out the secret... Did I find out? I did. Did I tell you? I did. Now it's your turn to tell secrets. So what about the installation?</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_1_dialog_7"><text>What's there to say... They found some device nearby, only it probably doesn't work. On the other side of the square you'll see a structure, and doors in the basement. The basement is quite big, somewhere deep inside there's a whole hall - that's where it stands. One smart fellow told me that it repairs brains - from that, what's it called, from magnesia... or this - from amnesia. There, damn it.</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_1_dialog_8"><text>Why did you decide it restores memory then?</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_1_dialog_9"><text>Hmm... and why did you decide the chemistry works? And that it's Chinese? Or do you understand Chinese? Maybe it's Japanese...</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="lim_energetik_2_dialog_0"><text>Listen, don't you have explosives?</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_2_dialog_1"><text>What do you need it for? Decided to make a boom for the old man?</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_2_dialog_2"><text>Basically, I was in that basement you told me about. The door's jammed there, won't open. I'm thinking, maybe blow it up?</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_2_dialog_3"><text>What a fool you are! To blow up in the basement - that's making trouble for yourself. The ceiling will fall on your head? Or you'll be crushed by a wall. Or worse, it'll bury me here and they won't dig me out. You, don't mess with such business! There's a crawlway from the other side. Not from the basement - but near the bridge somewhere, near that forest... the enchanted one. Who told me this... Damn it, I don't remember... I've started forgetting things lately.</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_2_dialog_4"><text>Won't a good artifact help you remember?</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_2_dialog_5"><text>Oh?! What are you?! Think the old man is like that grabber from the market? I want to help you. Well, wait - it's on the tip of my tongue... Ah! I remembered!\nDo you know Sanka Shatun? Such a stalker, experienced. He used to do big business here. But at some point, something happened to him. Went to the Swamps, to the scientists. Said it's quieter there. Now he works as a guide there. Haven't seen him for about six months. But people said he's fine, alive, only became silent, unsociable.\nHe told me he climbed into that basement. Wanted to palm off some crap on me, supposedly something valuable, but I didn't take it. If you see him, ask. He definitely should know where and what's there. And forget about your boom, we'll be healthier.</text></string>
<string id="lim_energetik_2_dialog_6"><text>Sanka Shatun... Maybe I've already met him.</text></string>
<string id="tex_meelofon_room"><text>Mikhalych advised to find a guide in the Swamps. His name is Sanka Shatun. He supposedly knows the code for the room in Limansk</text></string>

<string id="meelofon_room_start_dialog_0"><text>I'm from Mikhalych, to talk with you.</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_start_dialog_1"><text>From Limanych, you say? Well how's that old bastard doing? Still shaking down our stalker brothers? Give him my regards if you see him again.</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_start_dialog_2"><text>He said you managed to crawl into the little basement. The one that's nearby, right across the road from Mikhalych's storage. This basement reminded me of something, but I can't quite grasp what exactly.</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_start_dialog_3"><text>Reminded you? Hmm...</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_start_dialog_4"><text>Can you tell me how to get in? There's a hint that there's a clever installation there that can restore memory.</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_start_dialog_5"><text>Clever installation? Well, maybe... Only I'll tell you this - don't go there. I was there just a little bit, but it feels like my whole life flew by. The cold there is terrible and it reeks of death. There's something there that's better not to know or see. I've seen a lot in the Zone, but after that basement, it's like I was replaced. There's constantly someone's voice in my head - calling, calling, calling... At first I thought it was fatigue, but then I realized... It takes people's will away.</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_start_dialog_6"><text>Maybe so, but I feel I need to go there, really need to.</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_start_dialog_7"><text>Here, in solitude, I've thought a lot. Decided - enough, time to leave. I'm slowly collecting some loot. Want my own little house, a garden, I'll get a dog. I love dogs. As long as I remember myself, I've always fussed with dogs.\nAnd I'll tell you the codes, only you, if you don't mind, throw in a couple second-level artifacts or one third-level. Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_start_dialog_81"><text>So that's how it is? You need artifacts. I'll think about it myself. Maybe I'll pick the code.</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_start_dialog_82"><text>Need to run to my stash for artifacts. Won't be long.</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_start_dialog_91"><text>Think, if your brain works. Only you know yourself - today they ask you for help, and tomorrow...</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_start_dialog_92"><text>And I'm not in a hurry.</text></string>
<string id="tex_code_meelofon_room"><text>Sanka Shatun, guide from the Swamps, for a couple second-level artifacts or one third-level, is ready to share the door code for the room in Limansk</text></string>

<string id="meelofon_room_done_dialog_0"><text>I'm again about the codes, for the doors in Limansk...</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_done_dialog_1"><text>We agreed: two second-level artifacts or one third-level. Did you bring them?</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_done_dialog_21"><text>Yes, here's a pair of second-level, as promised.</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_done_dialog_22"><text>Of course. Third level, one piece. Take it.</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_done_dialog_23"><text>Yeah, forgot... somewhere.</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_done_dialog_24"><text>I thought about it... I'll manage with that code lock myself somehow.</text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_done_dialog_3"><text>Then listen:\nWhen you enter Limansk, well, through the bridge from Red Forest, there, if you go left, there's a door. Behind it is a tunnel, goes uphill. At the end of the tunnel is an iron door. There: </text></string>
<string id="meelofon_room_done_dialog_34"><text>As you wish...</text></string>

<string id="vil_petruha_start_101"><text>Oh! Marked One. What wind brings you? I heard you went north, toward the center...</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_102"><text>Yeah, the path north turned out to be quite winding. And what are you doing here? What about Cordon, bandits, ATP?</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_103"><text>Screw it all! What am I - a redhead? We're walking on a razor's edge as it is, and here's all kinds of riffraff with guns at the ready. They get high on all kinds of dope and charge. I told Wolf straight up, I'm fed up! Everyone else like normal people - grabbed loot and left for warm places. And here neither loot nor profit, just talk about great purpose: "protect newcomers", "defend Cordon", "cover Sidor's ass"...</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_104"><text>Come on, don't get worked up. Here too - I haven't seen artifacts...</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_105"><text>Hmm. Haven't seen, you say? Well... Well alright... Here's what I think, Wolf, he's an experienced stalker? Well why ask - even a blind man can see he's roamed the Zone more than once. And he should have loot not like some dying newbie, right?\nSo where's this loot? That's just it - nobody knows... But I'll find it. And I'll get out of here. Because I'm fed up to here... Got it?!</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_106"><text>Alright, alright...</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_107"><text>Yeah, I'm just venting. It's all built up. Got tired of everything. Don't pay attention...</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_201"><text>Well? How's it in the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_301"><text>Ah. You again.</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_302"><text>Greetings, Petruha. How are you doing?</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_303"><text>What's wrong with me, good company, warm, some loot comes my way. Money rustles in my pocket, and my soul feels warm.</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_304"><text>I can see your face is puffy and your eyes are cloudy. Got anything left for the hangover?</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_305"><text>Have you seen your mug in a mirror lately? Some cover boy... I got a little sick.</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_306"><text>Don't get worked up, I'm being friendly. They were looking for you.</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_307"><text>Who? Wolf, I bet... Worried about his loot, I guess. I got loaded with Stas once to the point of unconsciousness and he let slip that Wolf's stash is somewhere here, at the Forgotten Hamlet! He said Wolf mentioned that whoever tries to find his loot will wash themselves in shit up to their ears.\nTrue, it's all been in vain so far. He dropped it here, I'm sure of it. Where though? Did he really bury it in shit. Nothing, nothing. I'll get better a bit and turn the whole hamlet upside down, but I'll find it. Just watch it, this is my loot.</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_308"><text>Yours, yours. And why did you decide it's Wolf specifically? Maybe you... Sidorovich needs you.</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_309"><text>Don't bullshit me, Marked One. Who am I to Sidorovich? Just a fetch-and-carry. He has a whole village of people like me. And you can tell Wolf that if it got hot, let him come here himself, if he still finds me.</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_310"><text>Well, see ya. What couldn't you guys divide...</text></string>
<string id="vil_petruha_start_401"><text>Found loot? No? Yeah, nothing, I'm just asking.</text></string>

<string id="voron_nebo_baze_dialog_0"><text>I see you have a "Clear Sky" suit?</text></string>
<string id="voron_nebo_baze_dialog_1"><text>Yeah. Not bad. Good protection, not too heavy. But why the sudden interest? I'm not planning to sell it, and it's not your size anyway.</text></string>
<string id="voron_nebo_baze_dialog_2"><text>I'm looking for Strelok, heard of him probably? And someone said that guys from the "Clear Sky" faction were also looking for him. So I thought: maybe you know something?</text></string>
<string id="voron_nebo_baze_dialog_3"><text>Well-l-l-l... I don't think I've heard about Strelok. I won this suit playing dice in the Bar from one stalker. And I've heard about "Clear Sky" of course. Supposedly they had a base in the Swamps, highly classified. Few could visit there. They had good supplies, they say - like these armor vests, not some homemade stuff, but factory assembly. Only where it was made and who paid for it - mystery shrouded in darkness.</text></string>
<string id="voron_nebo_baze_dialog_4"><text>In the Swamps? Where exactly?</text></string>
<string id="voron_nebo_baze_dialog_51"><text>I don't know. I've never been there. Ask around with people. There are plenty wandering around - "clear sky guys". Maybe someone will show you the way.

<string id="botans_dialogs_0"><text>Hello.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_201"><text>Hi. What do you do? I mean what science?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3011"><text>Science? I'm a biologist by specialty, but lately I've been doing more chemistry. Why do you ask, are you a scientist? </text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4011"><text>No... I'm just trying to start a conversation... Chemist, then... Has chemistry advanced far in drug production? Maybe they've already invented something for memory restoration too?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_501"><text>I don't understand what you're talking about... There are developments, only I'm afraid if we start a discussion now, we won't understand each other.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_601"><text>That's true... So what are these medicines called, you say? Probably foreign again, some Chinese ones, ours can't invent anything decent...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_701"><text>I didn't say anything to you about medicines... Why would I? And anyway, you should get out of here...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_801"><text>I was just asking. Thought you really were a chemist. Well, I'm going then...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3012"><text>It's you again, I won't discuss anything with you.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4012"><text>Don't really need to. Some chemist you are... and you don't know anything about medicines...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_202"><text>Hello...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3021"><text>What do you want, are you here on business?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4021"><text>Nothing really... I wanted to find out what science says about zombies? They say they're hard to kill because their bodies aren't made of flesh, well after they rise from graves...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_502"><text>Science has nothing to do with this. It's all fiction and fairy tales. And you stalkers spread this and believe in all kinds of nonsense... There are no zombies, in the sense of risen from the dead, but there are dummies created by the Zone, understand... dum-mies, that is imprints, poorly made copies.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_602"><text>Have you even seen one such dummy yourself? Scientist, for fuck's sake... you just scribble theories, but what about practice?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_702"><text>I don't even want to talk to you in that tone...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_802"><text>Fine then. Go scribble your dissertations...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3022"><text>It's you again, I won't discuss anything with you.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4022"><text>Don't really need to. Let a "dummy" shoot at you, then you'll understand what it is...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_203"><text>Greetings... Science doesn't stand still, does it?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3031"><text>What do you care about science?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4031"><text>Nothing really... I heard recently they invented such a device, like they put it on your head and a person remembers everything that happened to them in life, at any given moment. True?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_503"><text>Umm... There was something like that in "American Scientists". Are you talking about a specific article? Remind me...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_603"><text>What article... I'm just talking in general, about the device.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_703"><text>Ah... So you're just... How do they say in your circles - shooting the breeze?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_803"><text>Well yeah... Only can't talk with you guys, all too smart.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3032"><text>It's you again, I won't discuss anything with you.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4032"><text>Don't really need to.</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_204"><text>What are you doing here? Studying what?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3041"><text>Studying, studying... You go your way, as you were going...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4041"><text>What, can't even ask anymore? Maybe I want to help. Do you need volunteers for experiments? For example, on memory restoration.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_504"><text>Memory? No, that's definitely not needed. But we can discuss testing a vaccine...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_604"><text>No... I'm not sick, I don't need a vaccine...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_704"><text>So what do you need? You're just in the way...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_804"><text>I don't need anything from you... Study your vaccine, I won't interfere.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3042"><text>It's you again, I won't discuss anything with you.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4042"><text>Fine then...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_205"><text>What are we studying this time?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3051"><text>What? Are we even acquainted?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4051"><text>I'm asking, what are you cooking up? Someone told me that you can get memory restoration medicines here.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_505"><text>Memory restoration? There's no such medicine, at least I don't have it... Someone played a joke on you.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_605"><text>Jokers... So there's really nothing?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_705"><text>That's what I'm telling you!.. You should step away, such a stench coming from you...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_805"><text>What? Ah... you mean the smell... Well yeah, we don't sit in offices. I'm leaving already.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3052"><text>It's you again?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4052"><text>Alright, alright... He doesn't like smells... intellectual...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_206"><text>What are you studying?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3061"><text>Mmm... What are we studying?.. How can I put it...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4061"><text>I'm asking, what are you studying?! Are you deaf or what... Someone told me that you can get memory restoration medicines here!</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_506"><text>Why are you yelling? What memory? We don't have medicines at all, only first aid kits. And don't yell like that.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_606"><text>I thought you couldn't hear...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_706"><text>I can hear everything perfectly, you're just preventing me from thinking... Go your way, don't interfere.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_806"><text>I'm leaving already... thinker.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3062"><text>It's you again? Go away, don't interfere.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4062"><text>Alright, alright... I'm leaving...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_207"><text>Greetings to science... How are the successes?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3071"><text>Little by little... Are you on an errand?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4071"><text>What kind? Ah... no, I'm just here to chat. Maybe at least you'll tell me, is it true that a person who lost their memory can turn into a zombie eventually?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_507"><text>I can't say anything about memory loss, but the idea that someone can just become like a zombie because of amnesia - that's unlikely. A person can be not quite sane, but not to the extent your stalker community talks about zombies...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_607"><text>Not sane... How's that?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_707"><text>Well, doesn't understand where they are, who they are, doesn't recognize surroundings, isn't "here and now", to put it briefly.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_807"><text>Ah... and if I'm talking normally with you, that means I'm still sane for now? Then alright, you reassured me...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3072"><text>It's you again, I don't have time to talk with you.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4072"><text>Alright, alright... Keep working...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_208"><text>What are we doing? Inventing or what?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3081"><text>What? Who are you even addressing?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4081"><text>I was just passing by here... I see a person who looks like a scientist, so I thought I'd talk about science...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_508"><text>And what should we talk about? About so-called artifacts? You guys don't want to know about anything except them.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_608"><text>Oh, come on... not everyone's obsessed with artifacts. I, for example, respect science, I'm always interested in chatting with smart intellectual people.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_708"><text>Right... the word "chatting" shows that you're a true intellectual. So what's this "chat" about?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_808"><text>I approach him with my whole soul, and he's mocking me. Smart guy... I don't want to talk anymore either.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3082"><text>It's you again? There won't be any "chat".</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4082"><text>I already figured out that you can't connect with for an intelligent conversation.</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_209"><text>How's the progress in the direction of improvement?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3091"><text>What? Who are you addressing now?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4091"><text>Yeah... you scientists are always flying somewhere and don't understand simple human phrases anymore. I'm just saying, instead of a greeting...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_509"><text>Sorry, but what you said - those aren't "human phrases".</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_609"><text>Damn it... Can't really talk with you guys, everyone thinks they're such... such... what's the word... Anyway, trick question: do you know how amnesia is treated?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_709"><text>No. And I'm afraid to disappoint you, hardly anyone knows. Is that all? Can I continue my work?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_809"><text>Should've said right away that you don't know... Instead of being an intellectual scientist... and "excuse me", and "I'm afraid to tell you", and the phrases aren't right for him... Go work then...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3092"><text>It's you again? I won't converse with you.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4092"><text>I don't want to either...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_210"><text>Well, how are things here?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3101"><text>What exactly? Who are you from?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4101"><text>I'm on my own.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_510"><text>And what do you want? Looking for something?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_610"><text>I'm looking, but not finding yet... I want to learn... the meaning of my life. I want to get to the truth.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_710"><text>Yes, that's a worthy goal of search. Only we don't have this "truth" here, the meaning of life, like "truth" itself, stalkers usually find at the bar.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_810"><text>Where? Ah... you're joking. You didn't understand anything, I don't need a drinking buddy... Alright, I see I'm in the way, leaving already.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3102"><text>You again? Still searching for truth?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4102"><text>It's funny to you... I'd like to see you...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_211"><text>Can I ask a little question?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3111"><text>Why not... Go ahead.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4111"><text>What do you think, can zombies be cured, their memory returned, brought to their senses? So they become human again...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_511"><text>I doubt it. You see, so-called zombies - they're not people. Many are confused by their "human" appearance. But zombies are just like... shells. Sort of walking bio-machines without a driver inside. Understand?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_611"><text>Machines? Who starts them up and where do they drive? To a gas station?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_711"><text>No... machines - not in the sense of mechanisms... I was speaking figuratively. How can I explain this simpler... A person - the person himself, his personality, individuality, his selfhood - he is not his body. Understand? He's in his body and controls it, though not even realizing it. Like a driver in a car - control is automatic. But you can accelerate the car and jump out of it, or something can suddenly push the driver out of the car, and it will still keep going by inertia, as if someone is still controlling it... I see you don't quite understand. Let me explain differently...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_811"><text>No... don't bother... All these complex theories make me nauseous. Something in my stomach... I'll drop by sometime later, we'll talk more.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3112"><text>You again? Want to talk about zombies?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4112"><text>Not now, maybe later...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_212"><text>May I trouble you?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3121"><text>Is it business? From Ivan Sergeyevich?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4121"><text>No... not from Sergeyich, but it's business. And here's the deal: if, let's say, someone lost their memory, how can it be restored? Who deals with this anyway? Maybe there are methods or even medicines?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_512"><text>So many questions and all "business"... Let's go in order. How to restore memory, I can't tell you. I think psychiatry deals with that. Methods... well, let's say, hypnosis is widely used, for example, the method of regression or "returning" to the past and, by the way, about medicines - some psychotropic drugs can be used to induce a hypnotic trance. Have I answered your questions?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_612"><text>Not entirely. In general it's clear, but what and how in practice? Do you know hypnosis yourself?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_712"><text>I haven't practiced hypnosis, but I have some understanding. For example, the patient is given a drug based on sodium salts... though you don't necessarily need to know that. Then an experienced psychotherapist, skilled in hypnosis techniques, can ask the patient to return to the past and tell what he sees, what he hears, that is, to relive that moment... and the patient speaks, tells as if he's in that past. Unfortunately, the patient himself, upon returning to the present, doesn't remember what he said or what he "saw" and "heard" while in a trance... But this helps the psychotherapist understand the causes of his mental disorder or psychological trauma.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_812"><text>Doesn't remember... Then what's the point of digging through someone else's memories if the "patient" won't remember anyway... No, that's not it...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3122"><text>It's you again? Want to discuss hypnosis techniques?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4122"><text>Forget them... just cluttering my head.</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_213"><text>Greetings... What's new in science?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3131"><text>You're no longer interested in the old stuff?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4131"><text>Alright, don't needle me... Maybe you can answer: how much are dreams connected to a person's past?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_513"><text>Hmm... I don't quite understand. What kind of dreams, what person? Do you mean yourself?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_613"><text>Does it matter... I'm speaking generally - is there a connection or not?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_713"><text>I don't know... a very complex and very vague question.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_813"><text>Well yeah... complex question... If I could say something definite, maybe I'd understand something myself. Forget it.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3132"><text>It's you again? Unfortunately, I don't have time to discuss dreams.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4132"><text>I wasn't going to...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_214"><text>What are you doing here?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3141"><text>Working... Or are you interested in specifics?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4141"><text>What ethics? I thought you could answer a couple of questions for me...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_514"><text>Questions... couple... so, this doesn't add up... Uhh, excuse me, what?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_614"><text>Questions, I'm saying... just a couple. I'd like to know the answers.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_714"><text>Uh-huh... here like this... You know, come back later, I'm busy right now.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_814"><text>You're all always busy...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3142"><text>Who do you need? Come back a bit later, I'm busy right now.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4142"><text>Yeah I got it already...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_215"><text>What interesting stuff are you studying this time?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3151"><text>The influence of electromagnetic fields on Zone objects, so-called artifacts, which possess exceptionally anisotropic properties...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4151"><text>Do they really have fractional properties?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_515"><text>What? Fractional? Hmm... Indeed, why not use narrow discrete impulses, the spectrum would be much wider... You came at a good time.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_615"><text>Huh?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_715"><text>Yes, yes... and correlate this with the Fourier function...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_815"><text>What?.. I'm outta here...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3152"><text>It's you again? Want to discuss methods of affecting artifacts?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4152"><text>Not really feeling like it...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_216"><text>Can I distract you with a couple questions?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3161"><text>What kind exactly?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4161"><text>They say hypnosis helps remember the past. What do you say about that?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_516"><text>That's your question? Let's hear the second one right away.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_616"><text>How?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_716"><text>Well... As far as I know - and I'm no hypnosis expert - it helps sort of "return" to a moment in the past. About whether the hypnotized person will remember this 100%, I can't say for certain. I think there are methods where he not only remembers everything, but even fully realizes himself "there". But since I'm not an expert on this matter, as I already said, I can hardly answer the "how" question.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_816"><text>So it's still possible... That's good enough.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3162"><text>It's you again... I'd ask you not to disturb me now.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4162"><text>Alright... I'm leaving...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_217"><text>Greetings to science! I figured, why not say hello, especially since you surely know the answer.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3171"><text>And greetings to you! What answer? To what?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4171"><text>Is it true, they say, that a person can be outside their body and still be aware of everything? Someone told me recently that during death or during surgery, consciousness, or maybe the soul itself, can hang under the ceiling and observe what they're doing to his body, and then decide whether it's worth returning or not?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_517"><text>Yes, such cases of clinical death have been described many times. I'm, of course, quite skeptical about the idea that a person as "consciousness" (or as "soul") and his body are a symbiosis, not a unified whole... This is generally more of a theological question than an academic one... Why did you even bring this up?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_617"><text>One thought won't give me peace... They say zombies are a "body" without a "soul", well or without "mind", without memory, what's the difference... So maybe, like with clinical death - his consciousness is hanging somewhere above him and thinking: "should I return to the body or not". And the body wanders and knows no peace, because consciousness left it, but hasn't departed completely yet... And this means you can still cure zombies, if you return consciousness to the body...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_717"><text>What questions occupy you though... I didn't think such... lovers of philosophical conversations could be found among stalkers.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_817"><text>What's philosophy got to do with it... For some this is a vital question. If I see myself, that is my body, from the side, it means... Ah!.. Indeed, better not think about such things.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3172"><text>Ah, it's you? Want to philosophize?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4172"><text>Not now...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_218"><text>What are we doing?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3181"><text>Who did you say that to?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4181"><text>To you, I think... You, that is.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_518"><text>Why? You stalkers obviously have a lot of free time... Just barging in like that, tearing me away from thoughts, just to "chatter" about nothing.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_618"><text>Why about nothing? We talk about life, about what's important... for survival. You're the one floating around in the clouds somewhere.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_718"><text>Is that all? Or will we "chatter" some more?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_818"><text>Alright, no offense... It's not like you have a sign hanging on you - whether he's thinking or just sitting. I'm leaving.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3182"><text>It's you again, we won't "chatter".</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4182"><text>I already figured that out...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_219"><text>How about discussing a couple thoughts?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3191"><text>What? What thoughts?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4191"><text>Well, I'm speaking figuratively... Crack open a bottle, that's all there is to it. And thoughts will appear right away, ones we can discuss...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_519"><text>Excuse me, crack open what?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_619"><text>There you go... Well, a couple drops on the chest, science. And intelligent conversation will flow. Eh?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_719"><text>Ah, that's what it is. No. And please, go crush your drops somewhere else.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_819"><text>I see... got an uncommunicative one... I'm leaving.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3192"><text>It's you again? I'm not planning to drink with you.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4192"><text>I don't have anything anyway...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_220"><text>What's new?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3201"><text>Hard to say... Sometimes new stuff is messier than old.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4201"><text>Oh! You can tell right away this is an intelligent person. So what, shall we take a small swig, for science?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_520"><text>I wouldn't mind, but... I can't today. We're running an experiment, need to be in shape.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_620"><text>What, is management strict? The Docent doesn't allow it, or whoever you have there...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_720"><text>No. That's not the issue. It's just, as they say, "work time - play time". Today happens to be time for work. So...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_820"><text>Yeah... "So don't bother me". Got it, I'm not stupid.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3202"><text>Is that you? Go away, don't bother me.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4202"><text>I'm leaving already...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_221"><text>Greetings to the scientific workers.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3211"><text>Do you have a package?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4211"><text>No... I'm just here casually. What kind of package - instruments, test tubes, flasks?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_521"><text>Doesn't matter. And don't be a smartass, we're not collecting mutant fecal samples here, by the way.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_621"><text>You don't understand jokes... Can you answer a simple question: how long can amnesia last in a person?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_721"><text>Maximum duration - for the rest of their life. Well, what else do you have?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_821"><text>Nothing... Talking to you is just one frustration.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3212"><text>It's you again? I won't discuss anything with you.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4212"><text>I won't either...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_222"><text>Hello... How's progress?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3221"><text>What do you mean? The latest experiment... Though, you're not...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4221"><text>Well yeah, yeah... I'm not one of yours. I thought you study radiation, what presses on the brain, so I asked...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_522"><text>I think you just have nothing to do. We don't study radiation, we have other tasks.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_622"><text>What kind, if it's not a secret?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_722"><text>That's exactly the secret. And I'll ask you to step away... please.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_822"><text>Don't trouble yourself, I'll step away. Be so kind as to write that down...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3222"><text>It's you again? I don't have time to shoot the breeze with you.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4222"><text>Shoot the breeze... Well fine...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_223"><text>Greetings...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3231"><text>Same to you.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4231"><text>What do you say about zombies? Can a person who lost their memory suddenly become one of them?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_523"><text>I don't think so. And in general, the concept of "zombie" only exists in the Zone. I'm not counting various Hollywood nonsense. After all, not a single person outside the Zone - with amnesia or without - became a zombie. And there are no cases of zombification at all, in the form we see it in the Zone. So... turning into a zombie out of nowhere is just your imagination.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_623"><text>Yeah... Sometimes you wake up, remember what happened recently, and think to yourself: did this happen to me, or is it just imagination, or was it a dream, or did someone tell me yesterday... And haven't I already turned into one... You pinch yourself - seems I still feel it. So you think like this every morning, you think, but what's the point...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_723"><text>Yes, in the Zone people often become withdrawn, introverted, turn inward... how to put it gently, they become inadequate in the end. But don't wind yourself up, be extroverted and accept the Zone's world as it is...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_823"><text>You scientists always talk with some theories... You should just say: "Forget it, man, don't sweat it!", and everything's immediately clear and understandable.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3232"><text>Is that you? Are you looking at the Zone more positively now?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4232"><text>I'm trying...</text></string>

<string id="botans_dialogs_224"><text>What are you doing here?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3241"><text>Studying the Zone, to put it briefly...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4241"><text>Yeah... The Zone... Is there any point in studying it? It seems to me you won't understand anything in the end.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_524"><text>There's always a point in studying, even if you're surrounded by complete mysteries and miracles.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_624"><text>Exactly "miracles". Today you're walking around, collecting loot, shooting zombies, and tomorrow at one beautiful moment in your head - bzzt - and you're already one of them... Nature's miracle.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_724"><text>You have very pessimistic thoughts.</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_824"><text>It's easy for you, you dug in here and don't go anywhere, just scribbling articles. You try walking through the Zone and seeing these miracles with your own eyes, touching them with your hands, then we'll see...</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_3242"><text>You're back with your pessimistic thoughts?</text></string>
<string id="botans_dialogs_4242"><text>Don't worry, my thoughts don't concern you...</text></string>

<string id="lim_lager_bandits_start_dialog_2"><text>So what? Got scared? Get lost, go shoot the breeze with the boss...</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_start_dialog_21"><text>You'd get scared here...</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_start_dialog_3"><text>You should scram, we're restin' here...</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_start_dialog_31"><text>Cool it...</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_start_dialog_4"><text>Don't sneak up behind me! I'll light up your melon - you'll spread out like horse shit... Beat it, go rinse the boss's brain.</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_start_dialog_41"><text>I need your ass...</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_start_dialog_5"><text>All kinds wander around here. And then, damn, food goes missin'... Get going peacefully!</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_start_dialog_51"><text>Yeah I'm goin' already...</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_start_dialog_6"><text>Share some loot, bro. Maybe folks'll warm up to you.</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_start_dialog_61"><text>Fat chance already.</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_start_dialog_7"><text>What're you snoopin' around here for? Wanna share some grub - then do it. My gut's rumblin' from hunger...</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_start_dialog_71"><text>Your gut - you feed it.</text></string>

<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_101"><text>Let's shake hands, bro! What's your name, haven't seen you around yet?</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_102"><text>Marked One. We guardin' everything?</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_103"><text>Shake hands, Marked One. Yeah we're guardin'. You never know what and how.</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_104"><text>How about keepin' an eye on the goods? While I take care of business...</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_105"><text>Well uh... That's possible actually. Just not for long. Not more than a week. You know yourself, the Zone... Can't trust it.</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_106"><text>But you'll vouch for a week? And what do you want for it?</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_107"><text>Generally, yeah. I'll watch for a week or my buddy will. So there's no unnecessary fuss, you'll give us fifty rounds for the Kalash or NATO peashooter for the stash, and same amount to pick it up. Seems we're not askin' too much, everything's fair, stalker-style... And... Don't put too much, I don't wanna risk my head for someone else's loot, you get it? You gonna stash your loot?</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_2041"><text>Fifty Kalash rounds, here you go... Just don't breathe in my ear...</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_2043"><text>NATO ones lying around here, take 'em... And turn away a bit...</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_2042"><text>Nah, not now. Maybe later...</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_205"><text>You offend me! I don't give a damn what you're hidin' there... There, opened it, put your loot...</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_201"><text>Hey there, bro! How's it goin'? You here on business or just flyin' by?</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_202"><text>And no coughin' to you too... Thinkin' about leavin' some loot.</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_203"><text>Well... As we agreed - fifty rounds for the Kalash or NATO and for a week you don't need to worry about someone stickin' their nose in someone else's business... If you don't stash too much, of course. People, you know yourself, are crafty...</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_301"><text>Ah! It's you. I heard you stirred up the military? So who are you after that? What the hell did you show off for? Now the military won't give anyone peace... Scram! Beat it!</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_302"><text>Uh...</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_3022"><text>You, give me back my stuff!</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_303"><text>Take your trinkets, nobody could care less about them.</text></string>
<string id="bar_seif_stalker_start_304"><text>What kind of people...</text></string>

<string id="mil_dying_start_dialog_101"><text>Ah!.. Oh! Mother! ...</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_start_dialog_102"><text>Why you moanin'? Should I give you a med kit?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_start_dialog_103"><text>Mmm! No... won't help anymore... they gave... did what they could. Thanks, didn't throw me over the fence... Who are you, friend? ...</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_start_dialog_104"><text>Maybe a friend... I'm a stalker. What happened to you? I'd help you, but I'm no doctor...</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_start_dialog_105"><text>If you're a stalker, then you're a friend... one of ours... I'd like to get to my people, to stalkers... I'm a burden here for everyone... Won't last long, I can feel it...\nBastard ... He'll get what's comin' to him there...</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_start_dialog_106"><text>What can I do... The Zone, brother, will take everyone in the end.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_start_dialog_201"><text>Ah! Mother!</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_start_dialog_202"><text>I see you're really getting worse. Hang in there, maybe you'll pull through...</text></string>

<string id="mil_dying_quest_dialog_0"><text>What's with that wounded stalker lying in the barracks?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_quest_dialog_1"><text>Ah... that one? A patrol found him at dawn not far from base. None of ours knows him. I don't understand how he managed to crawl here, the state he was in - just horrifying. He was holding on pure spite, seems like. We helped as we could, of course, but you can see he's not long for this world...</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_quest_dialog_2"><text>Did he fly into an anomaly or what?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_quest_dialog_3"><text>Who knows? Maybe so, maybe not. We questioned him, but he doesn't speak very coherently. Everything's mixed up in the man's head - he's delirious while awake, seems like. From what we managed to make out, someone robbed him, some scum. Took everything from him and shoved him into an anomaly to cover tracks. Whether it's true or not - we'll hardly find out. In any case, he doesn't have long left, that's clear. And you can't just throw him out like a dog... We bring him food, but he doesn't eat at all, only asks for water. And even then, only when he's conscious.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_quest_dialog_4"><text>That's what I thought, he mentioned some bastard... Probably really was delirious. And even if not - how would you find leads now?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_quest_dialog_5"><text>Actually, you should try - you'd do a good deed. No harm in trying. I'd strangle such scumbags with my bare hands. Since that bastard took everything from the stalker, maybe he hasn't sold his PDA yet. And if so, then he can be found by signal, right? This all happened quite recently, there's a chance. In the Bar, I heard, one brainy guy makes his living with such services. And anyway, there's always lots of people there. Ask around, maybe someone will recognize the bastard by description. He's supposedly dark-haired, as I understood. With a mustache... or beard.\nWhat was his name... Ah! Vasyan. Yeah, Vasyan. Something like... Red, or what... No, not that. Pockmarked! That's it!</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_quest_dialog_6"><text>Who-who?!</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_quest_dialog_7"><text>Are you deaf or something? Why are you staring? Is he your acquaintance? I'd keep away from such acquaintances.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_quest_dialog_8"><text>I don't know... It seems to me I've heard this name before, but I can't remember where and when. In the Bar, maybe... or not? And also... hard to explain, but I got the feeling this might be very important for me... Listen, you don't know if this Pockmarked guy was connected with Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_quest_dialog_9"><text>Well, you're asking! And if he is connected, then I'd take out that Strelok along with this Pockmarked. Looks like one gang!</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_quest_dialog_10"><text>No... that's not the point. I'll really try to make inquiries in the Bar. The chance is small, of course, but it exists.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_quest_dialog_11"><text>Go ahead, go ahead. Lots of scum hangs around there. They've gotten cozy under the wing of those dutiers...</text></string>
<string id="tex_mil_dying_quest_article"><text>At the Freedom base, in one of the barracks, lies a severely mutilated stalker. No one really knows what happened to him, they couldn't even find out his name. One thing is clear - he's definitely not long for this world and won't last much longer. From confused, half-delirious stories, the Freedomers learned the nickname of the stalker who is most likely involved in what happened - Vasya Pockmarked. I've already heard this name before, but can't remember where and under what circumstances. For some reason this seems important to me. I can't grasp the edge of the memory, but I have a feeling this person could help shed light on my past. It's worth trying to find him. It makes sense to start by asking people in the Bar.</text></string>

<string id="ryaboi_barman_dialog_0"><text>Haven't you seen a stalker here?.. Dark-haired like that, about my height, probably. Seems to have a mustache... or beard.</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_barman_dialog_1"><text>You should attach a mugshot to this description and hang it on a board. What are you babbling about? What kind of dark-haired? You guys walk around here - one's dark-haired, another has an unwashed face and they're all unshaven... Why do you need him?</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_barman_dialog_2"><text>Doesn't matter to you? But you're right, can't find anyone with such a description...</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_barman_dialog_3"><text>What's his name at least?</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_barman_dialog_4"><text>Ah! Yeah... Vasyan. Pockmarked. Something like that.</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_barman_dialog_5"><text>But you said dark-haired... Pockmarked, cross-eyed... I don't remember such a guy, but that's already something. Drop by the Docent, maybe he can help.</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_barman_dialog_6"><text>Yeah that's obvious... but the Docent searches by PDA.</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_barman_dialog_7"><text>Well then ask people around like that, what am I - supposed to teach you? All the time you're looking for some lame, cross-eyed, pockmarked guys... I'm tired of it, frankly.</text></string>

<string id="ryaboi_docent_dialog_0"><text>I need to track down a specific PDA again. Shall we do it?</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_docent_dialog_1"><text>Let's try it, why not? Get 5 PDAs of any kind and data on the person...</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_docent_dialog_21"><text>I don't have that many PDAs! Maybe we can make a different deal?</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_docent_dialog_22"><text>Here are the PDAs, the guy's called Pockmarked. Vasyan.</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_docent_dialog_31"><text>Well... Only kittens are born for free, you understand. Give me a couple simple artifacts, I'll run it through the database.</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_docent_dialog_32"><text>Vasyan Pockmarked... He's in the database. Or rather - two such pockmarked ones. But one is Vaso. Not him? No? Let's look at the marks that came from Vasyan's number... Voila! There is one. He showed up in the Red Forest recently. Though the signal's weak. Here, look. I'm sending the mark to your PDA. Remember the place right away, because these markers sometimes glitch and disappear by themselves.</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_docent_dialog_41"><text>Here you go, the guy's called Pockmarked. Vasyan...</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_docent_dialog_42"><text>Alright, I'll go to my stash and back.</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_docent_dialog_52"><text>Don't rush, or Yurko Lisaped got in a hurry - aged...</text></string>

<string id="ryaboi_2docent_dialog_0"><text>About my request, to find Vasyan Pockmarked...</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_2docent_dialog_1"><text>Did you bring payment? 5 PDAs or a couple simple artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_2docent_dialog_21"><text>Here are the PDAs, so what do the instruments say?</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_2docent_dialog_22"><text>Take the artifacts... So what's there?</text></string>
<string id="ryaboi_2docent_dialog_23"><text>Not yet, but I'll bring them soon.</text></string>

<string id="red_ryaboi_guard_dialog_0"><text>Listen, I wanna ask somethin'...</text></string>
<string id="red_ryaboi_guard_dialog_1"><text>What you want? You askin' where to put artifacts? We'll find somewhere real quick... Heh...</text></string>
<string id="red_ryaboi_guard_dialog_2"><text>Heh... I lost somethin' the other day. PDA. The Docent at the bar put a marker on it, so it led here... You don't have it, by chance?</text></string>
<string id="red_ryaboi_guard_dialog_3"><text>P-D-A... You're bein' real shady, boy... Lost it, you say. And trudged here lookin' for it... Ain't you afraid of losin' your head? I could put a marker on your forehead...</text></string>
<string id="red_ryaboi_guard_dialog_4"><text>Don't get all worked up... Looks like someone snatched it from me. I don't even need it anymore, I got myself a new one. Just had some photos there - classy chicks, brunettes, blondes... Thought I'd transfer 'em. And I trudged here on my own business, decided to ask while I'm at it.</text></string>
<string id="red_ryaboi_guard_dialog_5"><text>Babes? I'd take a look... I had about five different ones, collected 'em. But they're all broken already. Only one was working... But there were no chicks. I think. Yours or not yours, I don't know. I took it off a corpse myself. What the hell do I need them here without charging - sold it right away. So calm down - you're out of luck with the busty ones, go read magazines at the bar.</text></string>
<string id="red_ryaboi_guard_dialog_6"><text>From what corpse?</text></string>
<string id="red_ryaboi_guard_dialog_7"><text>Yeah there in the forest... In one tunnel. He's probably been eaten by monsters already. But don't you go there. We three barely got our legs out of there. I grabbed it on the run. I see the corpse is grinning and something's shining next to him, so I grabbed it. And ran for it, didn't even look at what it was. Only saw later. A controller set up house there... Lucky I still had my head. I won't go there again, not even for junk...</text></string>
<string id="red_ryaboi_guard_dialog_8"><text>Why do you... Grab whatever you find? Alright then... Sold it - don't regret it. I'll have to look at Playboy...\nListen, better tell me, haven't you met a stalker - Vasyan Pockmarked?</text></string>
<string id="red_ryaboi_guard_dialog_9"><text>Nah, don't know... You keep lookin' for someone, first you need to find one guy, then another, but you can't meet up somehow... You didn't work in investigations, by chance? Pockmarked, red-haired, lame, hunchbacked... There's plenty like that...</text></string>

<string id="way_to_mil_barman_dialog_0"><text>I was advised - to make my way north... Can you tell me?</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_barman_dialog_1"><text>To the North? The pole's pretty far, though...\nJoking, joking...\nThe north of the Zone... Everyone needs it. Only it's hard to get there for now. Heard about the Brain Scorcher? Terrible thing. There was a person - and bam! Only appearance remained. So, friendly advice - don't rush to become a vegetable.</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_barman_dialog_2"><text>I'm already a vegetable. But how do you get through?</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_barman_dialog_3"><text>Get through? Well... Seems like a path's been beaten, though by rumors, it's gotten tougher lately - you have to jump between anomalies, otherwise you won't even reach the Freedom base. You'll need a guide if you try to go further. Or a proper map, if you're not afraid to trust it. There, ask Tooth or catch Sanya Banker, he often goes there, to those anarchists. The dutiers are glad that such a maze formed between the Bar and the Freedomers - now the Freedomers won't make it here easily...</text></string>

<string id="way_to_mil_sanja_dialog_0"><text>They say you know the path north?</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_sanja_dialog_1"><text>Who says? People talk all kinds of nonsense! The north is closed! You should know yourself. The Brain Scorcher's there. Turns you into a zombie...</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_sanja_dialog_2"><text>Not that far. Barman said you go there, to the base of those, the Freedomers.</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_sanja_dialog_3"><text>Ah? Well yeah, I go. Sometimes. But you, friend. Sorry. I don't want to get involved in disputes between dutiers and Freedomers. I already have to look over my shoulder constantly. And if I start leading people around... No! Sorry, you're on your own, and I'm on my own. I'll trade artifacts, but find your own paths...</text></string>

<string id="way_to_mil_zub_dialog_0"><text>Can you show the road north?</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_zub_dialog_11"><text>North - you mean to the reactor itself? Or just figuratively? You should formulate things more correctly. Otherwise - "north"...</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_zub_dialog_12"><text>I said I'd show! What's with you! Alright. Got a decent artifact?</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_zub_dialog_2"><text>Well, they say there are people to the north of here. Some kind of army base, warehouses...</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_zub_dialog_21"><text>Ah? Decided to go to Lukash? Well fine, what do I care, it's your business. The path there's a bit crooked now though, anomalies poured in like... Anyway, lots.\nBut I can tell and show you how it is. For a small reward. In the form of a good artifact. A Dummy, or a couple third-level ones, if you have them.</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_zub_dialog_22"><text>Decided to go to Lukash? Come back in a week or two, maybe something will become clear about the cherished path. Heh-heh.</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_zub_dialog_31"><text>Yeah I have one, here's a Dummy.</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_zub_dialog_32"><text>I have two very good artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_zub_dialog_33"><text>Hmm. I'll think about it...</text></string>
<string id="way_to_mil_zub_dialog_4"><text>Oh! Good. Look here, remember carefully or write it down...</text></string>

<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_101"><text>Oh! I wish you good health. What brings you here? A stalker, I presume? One of those who try to profit from the gifts of the anomalous zone - from artifacts?</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_102"><text>And good health to you too. And you must be those very ones because of whom the Zone appeared: scientist botanists.</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_103"><text>Well, speaking purely practically, you'd be hard pressed to find botanists here... But I understand what you mean. Many around the world think this anomalous formation appeared as a result of activities by certain groups of scientists. I don't know the facts... But of course, anything's possible. Though unlikely.\nForgive me, what's your name? And... I didn't introduce myself - Shatunov is my surname, Konstantin Georgievich. Physicist.</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_104"><text>Marked One is my name. Physicists won't help me... I need to restore my memory.</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_105"><text>Well yes, well yes. Memory - that's for a psychiatrist. Probably. I'm quite far from that topic, forgive me.</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_106"><text>That's fine. What are you doing here? Watching dogs? Aren't you scared?</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_107"><text>Dogs? No, why such an assumption? Ah! You see that these mutants don't come close? Well, we have a certain device here that allows us to scare away these representatives of fauna.\nProfessor Grigorovich developed and tested a mechanism for affecting specific areas of the brain of mutated organisms. I have a vague idea of the theory, but in practice, as you can see, the beasts experience panic terror when approaching the emitters. So, answering your question: no, it's not scary. At least, the Zone's spawn aren't scary. But such a beast as "man"... That one, yes, inspires certain fears.</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_201"><text>You again, Marked One? Apparently you stalkers have nine lives, like a cat. So much death around...</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_202"><text>The grim reaper's passing me by for now... Probably has other plans for me...</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_203"><text>Do you believe in fate? Well... The more secrets of nature we uncover, the more often we ask ourselves: who controls this?</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_301"><text>What do you need, respected sir? We have no supplies.</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_302"><text>Why so "affectionate"? And what kind of respected am I?! I'm a simple stalker, Marked One. Not even an authority of any kind.</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_303"><text>I see. Here you only meet authorities, bosses, rembos.</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_304"><text>Yeah. And you sit here... Aren't you scared? Look how the doggies are clicking their teeth.</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_305"><text>We have nothing to fear from these brainless representatives of this anomalous zone region's fauna. The devices developed under Professor Grigorovich's guidance quite effectively repel mutants. It's just a pity that other beasts, called "humans", have to be repelled differently...</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_401"><text>Ah, it's you, Marked One. What are we looking out for? There's not much to profit from here.</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_glavn_start_dialog_501"><text>Marked One? I have very little time.</text></string>

<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_0"><text>Is there anyone further north? From your brotherhood... or from the "human beasts".</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_1"><text>I don't know who you classify as our brotherhood, but our expedition isn't designed for going somewhere further north. Everything becomes too dangerous and unpredictable there, the risk is colossal, and the expected return is negligible. I doubt anyone would invest funds in such a dubious enterprise.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_2"><text>How do you know? Have you been there?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_3"><text>To know something it's completely unnecessary to be there. We know much about the Sun, can predict its behavior with sufficient probability, understand the processes occurring in it, and we know it's dangerous and there's no life there. Yet no one has been there personally.\nI, for example, from many indirect data know exactly that from the eastern side of this town one could pass somewhere toward the Pripyat area. But I also know exactly that I won't go there and don't intend to engage in such stupidity. For what?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_4"><text>What about the Monolith, well, that they talk about? Make a wish - and it comes true. Many would go for that.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_5"><text>Yeah... What won't they come up with out of fear or ignorance.\nThe Monolith is just a hypothesis used to explain things strange for our universe. Presumably - it's some entity of incomprehensible nature. There's a theory that it's the result of a breakthrough or merger of our world with some other. Naturally, this entity is incomprehensible to anyone. How the Monolith appeared, when and from where, and whether it's there at all - is a mystery shrouded in darkness.\nThat's how it is. All at the level of speculation, fantasies and assumptions.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_6"><text>Why then does it appear in dreams, and some even hear it... And many identically. Did they all conspire and invent the Monolith for themselves?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_7"><text>Oh! You're a stalker. Right? You wear all kinds of things on your belt. Right? Do you even understand what this is, how it affects the organism, the psyche in the end? You only feel that some of these objects provides visible help for some reason. And you think: oh yes, this is good! Because when you noticeably feel better, it's immediately clear to you - good thing. But the fact that I started sleeping worse, wake up hungry and sick, my head is buzzing, some call appears, draws me somewhere to hell knows where for no clear reason... well that's all from vodka, probably. Had too much yesterday - that's your stalker explanation. Simple and understandable. And you don't even try to connect one with the other, to compare facts.\nYou should go about your stalker business...</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_8"><text>So I'm going. I need to find out where the Brain Scorcher control is located. Any idea?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_9"><text>Brain Scorcher? You mean "Rainbow"? You're too late, Marked One, they already turned it off.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_10"><text>I know. But because of this people are now going crazy differently. Either incredible laziness comes over them, or depression - only no one even wants to move. Looks like this "Rainbow" didn't work just like that. And now, if it's not turned back on, all people will die out in the Zone...</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_11"><text>You're really acting like Cassandra. They'll die out, they won't die out, what's the difference? Only criminals make their living here. It'll be easier for us to expand our level of knowledge without looking back at another idiot with an assault rifle.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_12"><text>Only criminals? Well... And Ivar said you could do business with.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_13"><text>You know Ivar? Hmm. He's probably the only person with normal psyche among everyone here. Helped us at first. Maybe you're made of normal stuff too...\nYou talk to Sergei Fedotov. He knows more about "Rainbow". And he and Ivar discussed this topic, by the way. But he's now on the other side of town conducting an experiment.\nAnd this - don't be offended. There were a couple "tough" stalkers here recently. They swept all our supplies. Bandits - in a word.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_14"><text>I'm not offended. To the other side of town then? I'll go look for your Fedotov.\nAh! I want to ask something else about Ivar. Do you know him well?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_15"><text>Well so... I'm telling you, he helped us, we sometimes discussed various topics with him. Why?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_16"><text>So he's at the Bar now. Not quite himself. Seems when he was turning off this "Rainbow", something went wrong... And he now says he did it in vain, that it shouldn't have been turned off. What do you think, why?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_17"><text>So was he not quite himself or did he speak coherently after all? That depends on how to understand this.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_18"><text>Well when he's himself - coherently, when not himself - not coherently... I'm saying that he turned it off, but now thinks it wasn't worth doing. Says that wasn't the point. And he's eager to turn everything back on. I don't understand. You met, maybe you can explain what he meant?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_19"><text>How would I know? Ivar, it seems, was studying the problem of mass madness outside the Zone. For some reason he decided that the surge of mental disorders lately is related to the Zone, and that the answer to the question "why is this happening?" should be sought right here. And I have nothing more to say. This isn't my topic, forgive me.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_20"><text>Didn't he tell you anything about a certain Strelok? For example, that he could have turned on the Scorcher?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_21"><text>No. He didn't say anything like that in my presence. Do you think someone turned it on deliberately? Then he's a complete psycho... this... what did you call him, Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_22"><text>Strelok, Strelok... But something doesn't add up here. No, he wasn't a psycho by any means. Where would Strelok get all kinds of communication plans, schemes, blueprints of underground tunnels and such? And how would a psycho figure all this out?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_23"><text>By the way, "Rainbow" is a secret facility. It was before, and now it probably still remains. There's practically no information about it in open sources. Much less plans and blueprints. Maybe in special archives. Either your Strelok was bluffing, or Ivar misunderstood him - one or the other. You say yourself - he's not himself.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_24"><text>Himself, not himself... I understood him as I understood. Strelok gave him some papers. Could Ivar have turned it off without knowing how and where? After all, the facility's secret, you just said so yourself.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_25"><text>What are you pestering me for? Such a secret archive no one will open for at least 50 years. This is only possible if he showed up from... from the future, where everything's long been declassified. In any case, go talk to Fedotov, and I have nothing more to tell you.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botans_radar_on_dialog_26"><text>Alright, alright... Indeed, why did I pester you?! Well, farewell.</text></string>

<string id="dead_lager_botans_start_dialog_2"><text>Greetings, stalker... Interested in our "repellers"? Well-well, it's obvious... Every stalker would like to pocket one of these. All kinds of creatures scatter in terror, almost without fail. Only here's the thing - size and weight... Weighs almost a ton. And if you count the battery compartment too!</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_start_dialog_3"><text>Good day. Want something? We don't really have anything... We're engaged in scientific research, not collecting curiosities... Well you understand, I think?</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_start_dialog_4"><text>Hello. Apparently you have some interest here? Or just - wandered in by accident? The place is quite dangerous, but thanks to the "repellers" we feel almost safe here. Only for you stalkers they're useless, they weigh too much...</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_start_dialog_5"><text>Greetings to you. Looking for something in this godforsaken place? If not for the hope of interesting discoveries, I'd never agree to come here... Monsters, anomalies, types with unstable psyche - brr... Horror!</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_start_dialog_6"><text>Uh... Greetings. Sorry, I'm not in the mood for idle chatter...</text></string>
<string id="dead_lager_botans_start_dialog_7"><text>Interested in artifacts? We don't have any. Sometimes you can see them appearing, but we don't risk going outside the repellers' range... And we don't need it.</text></string>

<string id="rad_halfdead_botan_dialog_101"><text>C...come here...</text></string> 
<string id="rad_halfdead_botan_dialog_1021"><text>Need a medkit? I'll help now, hang on.</text></string>
<string id="rad_halfdead_botan_dialog_1022"><text>Sorry, can't help with anything, I don't have any medicine.</text></string> 
<string id="rad_halfdead_botan_dialog_103"><text>What... what happened? Where is... everyone?</text></string>
<string id="rad_halfdead_botan_dialog_104"><text>Hang in there, man. No time for me to mess with you, need to get the hell out. How'd you even end up here? Get up!</text></string> 
<string id="rad_halfdead_botan_dialog_105"><text>I can't... can't feel my legs and my head... Everything's buzzing... What about communications? Where's Colonel Yarygin? Sakharov's not responding... Why is it so dark?</text></string>
<string id="rad_halfdead_botan_dialog_106"><text>Later, all later. Our brains are gonna get fried here. Come on already, pull yourself together! Can you even hear me? What's your name?</text></string> 
<string id="rad_halfdead_botan_dialog_107"><text>I can hear you, but I can't see... can't see anything... My surname's Prikhodko... Where am I? Are you from the second group?</text></string>
<string id="rad_halfdead_botan_dialog_108"><text>What second group?! If we don't get out of here right now, we're toast. This is Radar!</text></string> 
<string id="rad_halfdead_botan_dialog_109"><text>Radar? That can't be! We were going to the complex at Yantar... Listen, my backpack should be somewhere around here... There are papers in the secret compartment... Take them to Sakharov...</text></string>
<string id="rad_halfdead_botan_dialog_110"><text>Alright, I'll take a quick look around and... Sorry I can't do anything more for you, but time's running out... I need to keep moving.</text></string> 
<string id="rad_halfdead_botan_dialog_201"><text>Ah... Ugh...</text></string> 
<string id="rad_halfdead_botan_dialog_202"><text>Damn it!</text></string>
<!-- mike -->
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_101"><text>Who are you, brother? Do you have the gift of understanding? Do you wish to accept the truth?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_102"><text>Brother? Hmm... I'm Marked One. A stalker. And you?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_103"><text>Marked One, I see. You may call my individuality Brother Swan the Binding.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_1031"><text>Swan? You wouldn't happen to be related to Lebedev, the one who commanded the "Clear Sky" base?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_1032"><text>That is my past essence. Now I am the Binding. It called me, and I came. Joining the unified mind cannot happen without consequences. But those like me - the Binding ones, can help humans step across the chasm of misunderstanding.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_104"><text>Yeah, chasm... I have no strength at all...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_105"><text>No strength? That's understandable. "It" gathers its power. Surrounds, suppresses. Transforms everything, turns it into a plant, into stone, into nothing... Soon it will empty all thinking beings, and there will only be gray haze.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_106"><text>I don't understand anything at all! Who is "it"? What haze? I'm just tired... Need to rest.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_107"><text>Yes. You don't understand... Only one who can touch the informational field of the universe with their mind can see what is happening. It's a pity that our bodily shells are extremely vulnerable, but our mind cannot free itself from the body. It comes from there, through the tear in the fabric of our universe. It absorbs thoughts, extinguishes desires, seizes will and drains strength. Even we, the enlightened, cannot withstand this pressure. And therefore ahead lies only complete informational grayness, meaningless noise. So it will be...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_108"><text>"Informational grayness" wasn't enough for me alone, so now everyone gets it? Why wasn't it there before? What happened?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_109"><text>It's hard for me to explain. There was radiation that prevented the destructive field from spreading... But this radiation disappeared. Not long ago. And now It has no obstacles. And It will erase everything, grind it up and send it into oblivion...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_110"><text>Radiation? That's the one from the "Brain Scorcher", right? Don't think anything else like that was turned off.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_111"><text>Perhaps we don't know the specific designation. That radiation destroyed connection, and now the information itself is being destroyed.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_112"><text>You say you touch the informational field... How's that? Do you pray? Like to some deity. I've seen some like that here.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_113"><text>Not everyone can touch immediately and merge into the flow. Nothing happens instantly. Their mind resists and grasps at familiar images. Therefore they must recognize themselves and It, each in their own way. If it's easier for someone through faith, they do it that way. But the outcome is one. Everyone will come to It and It will absorb everyone.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_114"><text>I don't understand. So is this good or bad for you? You say it will erase everything because the field was turned off, but you yourselves strive toward it, toward knowledge... well, or whatever... toward the informational field... I'm getting confused. It's hard here. Walking is hard, breathing is hard, and thoughts get jumbled...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_115"><text>There was a field. And It was focused with attention here, brothers strived toward It, received answers from It... Now there is no field, and It breaks out, directs its gaze to the rest of the world and forgets about its children. Brothers lose connection with It, they feel miserable without its attention... And It devours the world... You should feel this, for you too are marked with Its sign.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_116"><text>What? What sign?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_117"><text>It has already called you more than once. You should remember. I feel this, you have been here. But I don't sense Its seal on you now, don't see it... But there was a sign...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_118"><text>Seal... was... I don't remember.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, brother. Every moment loses meaning before what's coming. Calm your mind.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_202"><text>No. I don't need peace. I'm not giving up.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_start_dialog_203"><text>What then? What desire do you still have within you?</text></string>
<!-- mike -->
<string id="monolith_leader_memories_dialog_0"><text>Can I also take something from this informational field? I want to remember who I was...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_memories_dialog_1"><text>The informational essence of each individual cannot be lost forever... And this means - one must find the mental path to the area of your essence.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_memories_dialog_2"><text>Mental... You mean imaginary or what? Can you explain for simple people? I'm not yet this, not "enlightened"...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_memories_dialog_3"><text>Simplicity lies in understanding of the mind. Now, in this interval of eternity, the destruction of the information carrier, the matrix of creation, is taking place. Entropic energy consumes everything. Until there is protection from that other, formless, all-consuming and destructive...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_memories_dialog_4"><text>Well, can you put it simply?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_memories_dialog_5"><text>Be patient and listen. It remembers you, if you bore Its seal. The entire matrix of your essence is already within It. And you are here, almost next to It. But It ceases to see what is close, for It directs its gaze far away. There is no barrier now. It strives to expand its boundaries, and therefore must absorb the informational essences of others, farther and farther from here, so that the energy balance is maintained. And this will continue all the time, It will strive farther and farther outward and less and less attention will be given to what is near, but more to what is distant. But until It absorbs everything, our brothers are deprived of Its support, and they are unhappy about this. As are you.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_memories_dialog_6"><text>That's simpler, right? How to digest all this now... \nSo I understand that until this installation, the "Brain Scorcher", is restarted, I won't be able to get a sensible answer? Its attention is too scattered? Or something like that... So It ignores you now too. Well, and I don't stand a chance...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_memories_dialog_7"><text>You are on the path to true understanding... Do what you understood, and you will have what you want to receive...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_memories_dialog_8"><text>Understanding of what?! \nFor you, probably, turning the "Brain Scorcher" on and off is simple, like two fingers on asphalt...</text></string>
<!-- mike_Федотов -->
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_101"><text>Oh... Hello there, man. Haven't seen new faces in a while. Two months already. Good thing the shift's coming soon, otherwise I'm sick of everything - this damn wildlife. I'm called Sergey. Fedotov's the surname. And what's your name?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_102"><text>Hello. I'm Marked One. Got business with you about this, what's it called, "Rainbow".</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_103"><text>Rainbow? What rainbow? We're working with "repellers" here. Or is this some kind of drink? We have almost a dry law here...</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_104"><text>No. Ivar told me - you know him, right? - that you know about the installation that fries brains. Well, and it's supposedly called "Rainbow".</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_105"><text>Ah! That's the wave emitter... And I somehow didn't get it right away. Ivar wanted to turn off that installation. Said that way you could radically solve the problem with the zombified. And I heard that they managed to turn it off, but the zombified didn't decrease because of it, which is very strange.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_106"><text>Yes, strange. Anyway, because the "Scorcher" doesn't work now, from the center of the Zone, maybe from the ChNPP itself, comes some field that takes people's will away. Nobody will even lift a finger, even when monsters are eating them. That's how things are.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_107"><text>Are you sure?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_108"><text>Well, not exactly sure... But Ivar thinks we need to bring back the radiation. It was a mistake, supposedly.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_109"><text>Strange. I always thought that the emitter's effect was just someone's oversight or a malfunctioning unit that wasn't working in the right phase. Or maybe it was specially configured that way? But who and why?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_110"><text>What difference does it make now? I need to find out where and how to turn everything back on.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_111"><text>I roughly know where the control point for this installation is located. We, together with one of the former technicians who serviced it, were improving our health at our departmental resort. He, of course, didn't elaborate much. And I wasn't up to that. I was then after contamination... Well, that's not interesting.\nIvar also asked and compared this with some plans, schemes, and kept being surprised, like, exactly, it should be there. I still can't figure out where he got them from... You should talk to him.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_112"><text>It's hard to talk to him, he's not himself right now. So where is this control panel?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_113"><text>As my acquaintance said, "Rainbow" is a huge complex, including both above-ground and underground structures, and it was originally built for completely different tasks. After that big emission, they started converting it for something else, but then abandoned it. Everything is powered by its own reactors. I'm somewhat familiar with the operating principle of such systems. When shutting down the installation, automation should shut down the reactors, and restarting them can be quite problematic. It's easier to switch to backup power generation sources - yes, such facilities can have several. But how specifically to do this in your case - I can't advise, because I don't know.\nNow, regarding the place from where everything is controlled. The main entrance there, as I understood, is located in sector 73. Uh, well, let me show you on the map - here the road runs straight into the hillside. That's where the entrance is located. It's definitely not the only one, but where the others are, I have no idea. I also know that somewhere in the area called Dark Valley by stalkers, there was an underground base where technicians from "Rainbow" lived. Surely some systems were controlled from there too. That's basically it.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_114"><text>Alright, I got it. Need to find out about backup power, and the entrance to the control point is at Radar, then. And something else in the Valley. Need to check that too.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_151"><text>Marked One, what is it?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_152"><text>I don't even know if it's worth it... Tell me, do you remember anything from your life? I mean, you remember, of course, I meant to say, how accurately do you remember everything?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_153"><text>Uh... what are you getting at?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_154"><text>You see, I've been in the Zone recently, that is, maybe for a long time, but I've been conscious recently. I lost my memory. But from time to time something like that surfaces. I'll see something in the Zone, and bam - some connection with something, as if from the past. And pictures in my head - like a familiar place, and here's someone familiar... But everything's somehow dim. I'm not sure it was exactly like that... and whether it was really with me. Ah! Well, this is about me, you won't understand... Forget it.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_155"><text>Why not... I understand you. Actually, not every person can guaranteed recall the exact time and place of any event, even if reminded about it. A person is not a machine, he doesn't store everything in memory so that it's always "at hand" and you can take any data from the shelf at any moment. He doesn't go through episodes sequentially in memory, but rather remembers associatively, in connection with something. There's something that reminded - remembered. No - then it wasn't needed, and doesn't bother much. You may be here recently, but can you, for example, precisely recall what happened to you a week ago - exact place, time, circumstances and so on?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_156"><text>Well... I remember where I was, what I was doing. Approximately...</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_157"><text>Exactly - approximately. And only a week has passed. And the farther, the more unclear the memories become. Usually people remember from the distant past only some very bright moments, and even then vaguely. There's only a feeling that yes - this happened to me. But the memories themselves are at the level of an unclear idea of what really was there.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_158"><text>At the level of an idea? Imagination, you mean? So this maybe didn't happen to me, but I made it up?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_159"><text>Well, I just put it that way... At the level of thoughts, sensations and impressions, without awareness of exact phrases, place, time. Approximately where, approximately when, approximately how. I think it's the same with you. Something suddenly reminds you of something, some connection arises, and something surfaces in the mind, resembling events in the present. Some bright association.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_160"><text>So you're saying that even you don't remember everything exactly?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_161"><text>Nobody can remember everything-everything exactly. Of course, it depends on the person. Someone remembers more, someone less. Well, consider that I remember about myself a bit more than you about yourself, that's all. Look at it more simply.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, wanted something else?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_radar_dialog_202"><text>No, just decided to say hello.</text></string>
<!-- mike -->
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_0"><text>It's me again...</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_1"><text>Oh! What else now?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_2"><text>Do you know anything about teleporters in the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_3"><text>Teleporters? An interesting hypothesis and seems not without logic, though it doesn't really agree with academic science... But what's this to you?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_4"><text>I thought you were just observing a teleporter here. Thought there, in the center of the city it is...</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_5"><text>No, we have other, more down-to-earth tasks here. We, of course, observe that anomaly too, but what made you decide it's a teleporter? Did you teleport here through it?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_6"><text>No... Just walked here. Someone told me about teleporters... including specifically about the local one. And I thought you were studying exactly that here. They say the Zone sometimes lets some people through to the center. If he fits somehow...</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_7"><text>What-what? You think that the Zone can somehow make decisions, that it does something consciously?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_8"><text>Well... I don't know. But they sometimes say that it kind of "breathes", or as you'd put it - changes energy flows back and forth. Well, simply put it "breathes". Stalkers generally treat the Zone with respect, like something living... Again, all kinds of monsters, where do they come from, from what parallel world? Someone creates and launches them here. Through all their passages, wormholes... You can't help but think that it's alive and thinks something about us. And records everything somewhere in its memory... in this, what's it called - noosphere.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_9"><text>How you stalkers love to fantasize! Noosphere, parallel worlds, time loop - how it sounds! You make up tales and amuse yourselves with them. However, some of our scientific minds are no better, they also have plenty of fantasies... It's enough to simply say - SOMETHING happened. You can strain your throat trying to impose your vision of this something, but it doesn't make it more understandable and safe.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_10"><text>What about you? You're studying something here, trying to understand this something... Even though it's dangerous.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_11"><text>I'm saying - we have more trivial, practical goals. We're not theorists, and do we need to understand everything thoroughly? In nature, identical beings are stamped without anyone's intention based on genetic code. And the vast majority of people don't even strain to understand anything about it. They just live with it. Just live, stamp their own kind and that's it... But even without understanding something as a whole, some part of it can be learned to use practically, in everyday life.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_12"><text>That's what I'm talking about! You have your practical task, I have mine. I don't care, of course, whether the Zone breathes or not, whether it's alive or not... But if it's currently "exhaling", for example, and not letting people through to the center, then I'd practically like to understand how to make it "inhale". Maybe then it would be possible to pass, eh? Not necessarily here, maybe in some other place, but the Zone would still let you through to the center.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_13"><text>Yeah... Well, let's reason for interest's sake. I think to turn the force vector in another direction, you need to apply some force from outside. That is, you need some serious energy push. But I don't know what it could be. There was the "Rainbow" installation, probably it could provoke such a vector change... Does such a theory suit you?</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_14"><text>Hmm... Well, yeah. No matter how you turn it, we need to turn on that "Rainbow".</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_15"><text>Well-well... I wish you luck.</text></string>
<string id="dead_botan_teleports_dialog_16"><text>Same to you.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_rem_new_gg_0"><text>When I was unconscious here, did I say anything?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_rem_new_gg_1"><text>No, not really, mostly just groaned. And like that, incoherent something. I didn't particularly care. What's up? Remembered something?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_rem_new_gg_2"><text>How to put it... Something seems to be coming back. I'm even writing it down in my PDA just in case.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_rem_new_gg_3"><text>Really?! Let me read it.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_rem_new_gg_4"><text>Sidorovich, this is personal. None of your business.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_rem_new_gg_5"><text>Well then tell me, in general terms. I did nurse you back to health... like my own son.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_rem_new_gg_6"><text>Yeah... Next you'll say you raised me from diapers, nursed me with your breast. And then gave me a knife and sent me out into the world.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_rem_new_gg_7"><text>Stop remembering the bad stuff. Better tell me what good you remembered. I'm curious who you are, where you're from.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_rem_new_gg_8"><text>Who I am... I haven't properly realized myself, haven't digested what I remembered.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_rem_new_gg_9"><text>Ah... well digest-digest. Only you watch out, whoever digests inside themselves for too long, their brain might boil over. Better tell, share with people.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_rem_new_gg_10"><text>Alright then... I'll share. Sometime later...</text></string>

<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start1_0"><text>Docent, can you help find someone?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start1_1"><text>Track someone?! Not my specialty. I'm more about the electronic side.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start1_2"><text>That's exactly the side I need. Is it true what they say, that you can find a person in the Zone through their PDA?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start1_3"><text>In principle, we track all unencoded beacons from personal PDAs, and I can put a mark of a specific handheld on your map.\nNot for free, of course... You've probably already heard that I mainly work with information. Quite often, stalkers' personal PDAs contain unique data that looks like complete gibberish to a non-specialist.\nBring me 10 any PDAs and I'll give you access to tracking devices you're interested in directly from my laptop... for a reasonable fee. And I'll throw in something extra as a bonus.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start1_41"><text>Good. I happen to have ten PDAs with me, here you go.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start1_42"><text>I see. We'll return to this topic later.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start1_51"><text>Excellent! See the laptop on the table? Now it's at your disposal anytime, you just need to connect your PDA.\nWhen the target is found, a certain amount of rubles will be charged from your device.\nKeep in mind that real-time movement tracking won't work, at most - you'll find out where the target last went online, and from there it's up to circumstances... use your head.\n\nMost importantly: when you type a search query - look, I recently spilled coffee on the keyboard, so I had to temporarily reassign some keys in the driver. Instead of "ё" type "/", and instead of BACKSPACE, to delete excess or wrong symbols - DEL. For those who aren't friends with technology at all, symbol deletion is duplicated with the "left arrow" key, and you can restart the search program by pressing "right arrow". If anything, I've attached a memo at the bottom of the laptop screen.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start1_61"><text>Everything seems clear. What about the bonus?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start1_71"><text>Just a moment... now... where did I put it?! Ah, here! Stalker belt, for two slots. Some guy ordered it from me, but hasn't shown up since, it's been the second month already. And his PDA hasn't been seen on the network for a long time. Everything points to - the customer perished. Anyway, it's yours.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start1_81"><text>Well... thanks.</text></string>

<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start2_0"><text>Docent, I'm about finding people.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start2_1"><text>Brought 10 PDAs?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start2_21"><text>Yes, here...</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_start2_22"><text>No, but I'll bring them soon. Wait.</text></string>

<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_11"><text>Marked One, are you having memory lapses again? There's the laptop: take it and use it.

<string id="bar_docent_npc_search_2"><text>Really, what's wrong with me?!</text></string>

<string id="final_vrach_dialog_00"><text>What do you want to know, Doctor?</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_0"><text>So what did you understand about yourself? Did you remember everything?</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_1"><text>Can anyone remember everything? Nobody can remember every moment in life... Yes, I remembered some things, but that's not the main thing, the main thing is I understood who I am.</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_2"><text>Tell me.</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_3"><text>Why do you need this? This is my life, I needed to understand this, not you... You wanted me to understand myself, I understood... But anyway, if you want to know, I'll tell you...\nIn childhood we lived in a small town in the middle belt. Well, childhood is childhood, almost like everyone's - a carefree time. I remember some episodes. I remember how a dog bit me, I remember how I almost drowned, though that probably just seemed that way to me from fear - how could you drown in that puddle. True, I remembered the offense, that I was drowning and nobody paid attention to me...\nWith my parents I had normal relations, only they were constantly busy with work. Father - a big boss, all the time in some meetings, mother - in shifts at the factory. We also had grandmother lying at home, seemingly paralyzed. I constantly had to take care of her. Consider that all my childhood passed in caring for granny...\nAt school everything was also like everyone's - ordinary. Like all teenagers, I wanted to stand out in something and was proud later when they noticed me. I studied normally it seems, as far as I can remember. At least chemistry, anatomy, biology I liked, mathematics and other exact sciences not so much... In short, what's there to tell...</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_4"><text>Continue, I'm interested.</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_5"><text>Well then I decided to study to be a doctor. The choice was quite understandable - I didn't suppose anything else by that time. Institute, studies, internship... I liked it. From my very first working day I stood out, I remember I immediately saved some woman. And then there were various such "heroic" acts, when nobody could but I could... Somehow during one operation I had to substitute for the chief surgeon. Everything went successfully, they even noted me. Funny, found something to be proud of - my direct duties...\nI wasn't in the army, but I worked for some time in a hospital at a military town - all sorts of things happened there too, there was routine and memorable cases, for example when I miraculously survived an accident while saving some soldier. Later I returned to my city and got a job at the hospital there... I was in good standing, someone even said: "golden hands". Maybe they were right about something... I remember once I helped a neighbor, not quite legally got her expensive medicine - there's your "golden hands" for you... I got off normally then, but acquired the fame of a "wonderful doctor" in the city... Later I got married there, like everyone. And then... this tragedy with my son...</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_6"><text>What happened to him?</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_7"><text>We wanted a child, but it didn't work out. And finally he was born, but with a birth defect. But somehow I managed to pull him through. How could I not - I'm doctor "golden hands"!.. He lasted much longer than the term marked by doctors. There was hope, but... I would have given everything then to find some magical artifact that resurrects the dead, if it existed... Then I thought about the Zone. I knew something, rumors reached me, but I didn't pay attention to all this. Where's the Zone and where am I? What connection could there be? But then I felt this connection, the Zone called me to itself... I had some ridiculous confidence that I was above death, that I was stronger than it, and there was a desire to show that I could save my son... or rather, that I could bring him back, could cheat death. That's how I came to the Zone, exactly for this... How stupid.</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_8"><text>Don't blame yourself, the main thing is you finally remembered who you are...</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_9"><text>You think what I just told you is the main thing? You think this has some meaning for me now? This is all not the main thing.</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_10"><text>I don't understand... This is what you were striving for...</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_11"><text>You wouldn't understand. I wasn't striving to remember, I was striving to realize myself. Now I understand this clearly. All these personal details - where I was born, where I studied, where I got married - unimportant. What's important is that I finally realized who I really am, what I'm like...\nAnd the conclusion isn't joyful: my whole life I was driven by some stupid vanity, which eventually grew into real pride. I imagined myself equal to God, imagined that I could defeat death, that everything was under my power... My wife didn't understand me then, and nobody understood when I left for the Zone. They thought I was a stubborn idiot, made up a fairy tale for myself and believed it, they probably thought I lost my mind after my son's death... They didn't understand, I didn't understand myself then either. But finally I understood everything. I wasn't driven by stubbornness, but by excessive PRIDE, as in everything in life...</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_12"><text>You're greatly exaggerating because you're too demanding of yourself. From your story I see that you helped people, saved them, tried to avert trouble from them with all your strength. What's bad about that? You had positive qualities - compassion, desire to help, but for some reason you made such a strange conclusion.</text></string>
<string id="final_vrach_dialog_13"><text>What difference does it make why this conclusion? Maybe I'm too self-critical, maybe I'm too suspicious and made this up for myself, maybe Monolith suggested this to me, maybe I dreamed this... You still understood nothing. I could have pretended, deceived myself, told myself that it's not me, that I'm not like that, it's not mine. But why? For me CERTAINTY about myself is important. Before I was constantly uncertain, didn't understand what from "memories" was mine and what wasn't, wasn't sure what I was like, what drove me... Now I know. And it doesn't matter why this feeling appeared, and whether it corresponds to what YOU see in me. The main thing - I'm now certain who I am and what I'm like. I finally understood MYSELF.</text></string>

<string id="final_common_reply_14"><text>Well, so be it, if such understanding is important to you...\nAnd what now? Where are you going? Rest here, you're completely exhausted...</text></string>
<string id="final_common_reply_151"><text>I don't know. I no longer want to return to the past, and I have nowhere to go. My place is here, in the Zone. So... I'll rest and head to Cordon, and we'll see from there...</text></string>
<string id="final_common_reply_152"><text>I don't even know... What I'm certain about is that I can't return to ordinary human life anymore, and there's simply nowhere to go. My place is here, in the Zone. There's one idea about going to Monolith. I want to work through all options to the end, since I've started. So I'll head to Bar first, need to talk with someone there.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_reply_153"><text>I don't even know... What I'm certain about is that I can't return to ordinary human life anymore, and there's simply nowhere to go. My place is here, in the Zone. Moreover, something tells me - Monolith won't let me go so easily. It's not for nothing that I have its "seal" on my hand, which the weirdos from Pripyat recognize. And it seems to me this mark is just the external manifestation of its connection with me. So I want to test one idea. Therefore I'll head to Yantar first, need to talk with someone there.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_reply_16"><text>Good.\nWait! You still haven't said your real name. What should I call you now?</text></string>
<string id="final_common_reply_17"><text>Call me - Marked One.</text></string>

<string id="final_botan_dialog_00"><text>What do you want to know, Doctor?</text></string>
<string id="final_botan_dialog_0"><text>So what did you understand about yourself? Did you remember everything?</text></string>

<string id="final_botan_dialog_3"><text>Why do you need this? This is my life, I needed to understand this, not you... You wanted me to understand myself, I understood... But anyway, if you want to know, I'll tell you...\nIn childhood I stuttered a bit or spoke poorly, something like that. Until about 6, probably. They teased me because of my tongue-tied speech... Some offenses come to mind, now it's all not so important, but then it mattered. Then I started speaking normally, but for some time I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to express something in words, and more often stayed quiet. I remember in school one girl I liked, but I was afraid to talk to her... Nonsense, in general, then she was dating another guy anyway. But this unwillingness to talk much made me read a lot, write, think, which later affected my life...\nMy parents loved me. Father was a leading specialist at a closed enterprise. Mother worked as a teacher. So they were even glad that I read a lot and didn't hang around the streets much. I was in libraries more often than in the yard with the kids... In short, what's there to tell...</text></string>
<string id="final_botan_dialog_4"><text>Continue, I'm interested.</text></string>
<string id="final_botan_dialog_5"><text>Of course, I already wanted to become a scientist in school. And not just a scientist, but an outstanding one... Childhood dreams. I entered university and though with great difficulty, I got into a serious faculty where you could engage in science from the first courses, well or be involved in it... Now I think that probably I alone was a bookworm and workaholic, constantly in libraries and laboratories. Others took life more simply. So be it. The only thing I regret is that many things characteristic of youth somehow imperceptibly passed by me while I pored over textbooks. Others, of course, didn't miss their chance... Well, that's not the point...\nAs it was, I still managed to get married. I can't say it was for love - it had to be done, it was proper. Only it didn't work out for us. I never had time to deal with family life, science interested me more than my wife. And one day I caught her with another... with some nobody. I left myself, was even glad about it - now nothing bound me or distracted me from science...</text></string>
<string id="final_botan_dialog_6"><text>What did you do?</text></string>
<string id="final_botan_dialog_7"><text>The field? First pure chemistry, then biochemistry became interesting. For a time I worked for the military industry. I didn't care then what would come out in the end - a harmless pesticide or poisonous substances, I was engaged in pure science. I wanted to make it, wanted to take a position in the scientific world, achieve something worthwhile. However you look around - everywhere grabbers and mediocrities, hiding behind scientific titles!.. Well, alright. Then I worked at one decent polymer production company, did a little side work at a scientific journal as a consultant...\nThere were cushy spots and quiet ones, all kinds. But I left everywhere. There was no scientific perspective there. Of course, those who chase money or handouts, not results, are like cheese in butter there. But not me. I remember how I left my last place. Someone tried to persuade me, someone sympathized, but mostly they didn't understand. And what do they understand! I always believed that a real scientist can achieve real results only through continuous work, not through connections...\nThat's how I ended up in the Zone. I asked for it myself. They organized everything for me and arranged for me as a scientific worker at a field laboratory in the exclusion zone. I was expecting great success. I simply had to prove to myself and others that I too could do something. That not only connections, stolen academic degrees and cushy spots lead to success, that one's own work also means something, one's own mind, one's own discoveries too... Now I see that all this heroism, these deprivations and ordeals lead to nothing... How stupid.</text></string>
<string id="final_botan_dialog_8"><text>Don't blame yourself, the main thing is you finally remembered who you are...</text></string>

What's important is that I finally realized who I really am, what I'm like...\nAnd the conclusion isn't joyful: my whole life I was driven by some stupid resentment. Resentment towards others who managed to grasp, do, say, write something faster than me... This grew into ordinary envy. I couldn't accept that someone was smarter than me, more agile, more inquisitive... I couldn't accept that my wife preferred me to some office rat, he wasn't worth my little finger! I thought that everyone around were mediocrities and those with connections, that I alone achieved everything through my work, that I worked only for science. But finally I understood everything. In life I was driven only by resentment and ENVY...</text></string>
<string id="final_botan_dialog_12"><text>You're greatly exaggerating because you're too demanding of yourself. From your story I see that you worked a lot, studied a lot, achieved good results.

<string id="final_oper_dialog_3"><text>Why do you need this? This is my life, I needed to understand this, not you... You wanted me to understand myself, I understood... But anyway, if you want to know, I'll tell you...\nIn childhood we lived in the south in a small village. For some reason I only remember summer - apple orchards around, the fragrant smell of apples... I remember how we gathered them every year. Pleasant pastime, you climb trees and eat your fill...\nWell, what else is there? Ordinary children's games, we all played together - we had no division into "you're from our neighborhood, and you're not from ours" - all equal. One school and practically one street for the village - the main road. That's where we played, now tag, now "cops and robbers". I loved being a cop, it gave some advantages - you could take part of the "loot"... Childhood, in a word.\nThen I went to sports school, even went to competitions. Used to travel all over the Union... or Russia, I don't remember what it was then. Once I almost missed competitions - father got sick, I had to go to him, and the starts were the same days. Good thing the coach sorted everything out... And I was glad - actually I felt sorry for the money for the ticket, I was planning to buy equipment. I was always economical, saved for all sorts of trinkets - saved every penny, didn't spend for nothing. They even sometimes called me a tightwad for this... In short, what's there to tell...</text></string>
<string id="final_oper_dialog_4"><text>Continue, I'm interested.</text></string>
<string id="final_oper_dialog_5"><text>Then service. I didn't get to any hot spots. Quietly and peacefully served my 2 years in the northwest, between Pskov and Novgorod. True, there I got addicted to vodka. Service was quiet, no control, glass after glass, that's how I got hooked. But then the infection let go. Not immediately, but thank God I quit...\nAfter the army there was nowhere to go, but money was needed, you have to live. In the army just before demobilization they recruited us for police, so I signed up. Then police school. I wanted to get into traffic police after it. They said that if you have a head, you can do well in traffic police - not by position, of course, but "on the side"... But fate arranged that I got into criminal investigation. You can't really profit much there, but also not bad, you can let someone off, on the contrary threaten someone, take confiscated goods somewhere - enough for life...\nThen I got married, of course. I didn't throw a loud wedding - expensive. Just among our own... I remember how I met with my guys just before the wedding. We were planning a wild vacation with the guys, well I had to take back my share - wedding was coming up, not enough money. The guys didn't understand then, got offended...</text></string>
<string id="final_oper_dialog_6"><text>And then?</text></string>
<string id="final_oper_dialog_7"><text>Well what then - work, mostly routine... had to spin around. Sometimes we did not quite legal things, slipped bribes somewhere... I took them. And always justified myself that everyone does this, that everyone has long been mired in bribes, if I don't take, others will... Just excuses. But such is the system, in a pack of wolves a sheep is quickly driven out, and even faster eaten. Their own will eat them. That's what happened to me...\nSomeone at the very top of the region embezzled and got caught. They pulled the thread, well checks began in all police departments. Something surfaced connected to me, insignificant, but still. Later I realized it didn't just surface, somehow they needed someone for show. Someone had to have "measures taken" against them. They simply chose me and set me up. They reminded me how I once didn't want to share. That's how they squeezed me out of the system... By that time I was acquainted with one stalker, he was involved in our case. I wanted to shake things up, and money was needed - loans, credits. And that stalker told about the Zone and about good, fast loot... I listened with open ears, fool.</text></string>
<string id="final_oper_dialog_8"><text>Don't blame yourself, the main thing is you finally remembered who you are...</text></string>

What's important is that I finally realized who I really am, what I'm like...\nAnd the conclusion isn't joyful: my whole life I was driven by greed, which eventually grew into real avarice. I was always short of money, saved, saved, but what for? To put aside for the future and save again, save... I didn't miss any opportunity to grab somewhere, where they give or where in my opinion you can take yourself. This grew into some kind of mania... My wife no longer understood this, said that I would get into trouble with this grabbing someday, that our own cops would arrest me... She was right, but didn't understand that we were all long tied to each other, that one principle operates in our organs: "one hand washes the other" or "one crow won't peck out another's eye". Unless you yourself get too carried away... Which happened to me, which led here. And all because of my AVARICE...</text></string>

<string id="final_bandit_dialog_3"><text>Why do you need this? This is my life, I needed to understand this, not you... You wanted me to understand myself, I understood... But anyway, if you want to know, I'll tell you...\nIn childhood I was short, but brazen to the limit. Could go at any tall guy like a pug at an elephant. This brazenness I even liked, it gave me something - candy, sweets, gum. And also authority, probably just as small as I was. Even funny... But what else did you need in childhood?..\nI don't even want to remember my parents. Father was a plumber, a drunk, dragged everything out of the house. Mother was some painter, eternally worn out by work, life, father, me, fate... You wouldn't get a penny from them, if they bought something, it was such crap that it would've been better if they hadn't wasted money... Had to take something from life myself. We grabbed everything that wasn't nailed down. I remember at the communications depot nearby, we dragged away so much cable that you could've wired up a whole city. We burned and sold the copper. At least some of our own money. In general, we spun around as we could... In short, what's there to tell...</text></string>
<string id="final_bandit_dialog_4"><text>Continue, I'm interested.</text></string>
<string id="final_bandit_dialog_5"><text>Everything already pissed me off by then. After school what to do? Working at a machine wasn't for me - that's for suckers. Army? Well screw that - I dodged it as much as I could. And I didn't want to seriously steal either, I wasn't planning to get into adult crime. We thought up then with a buddy to bolt abroad and stay there... But then some check came to the depot, they started digging who was swiping copper and cable. There were enough of their own thieves there, but they had to blame someone for all the losses... In short, the choice was simple - either slip away to the army, and without having a scapegoat handy they'd find someone else, or get arrested and pinned with embezzlement. I, of course, chose the first. That's how I ended up in the construction battalion...\nIn that construction battalion, service wasn't service. More like pastime. I coasted through the first year, and in the second I gave up on everything. On commanders, on service, on these "fellow soldiers". Just waited for discharge. And after the army what to do? No work, and no desire to slave away... But I got lucky. Former buddies set me up. Easy job - watch over girls while they're at work, shake up or threaten a client if he starts acting tough. Like that, mostly just putting on a show... You could live, but appetites were bigger than what that "work" gave...\nSo that's how I "moonlighted", sometimes as a pimp, sometimes we covered a club, sometimes went to a meeting with someone, sometimes threatened someone... I myself didn't stick my head deep into crime - didn't want to get burned. I had buddies, of course, who were already doing time, but I spun around so that I didn't even have any arrests. I was clean.</text></string>
<string id="final_bandit_dialog_6"><text>What happened next?</text></string>
<string id="final_bandit_dialog_7"><text>I shacked up with a broad. We weren't married, just - cohabitating. What a slut she was... But the main thing for me was to have a pad and always have somewhere to crash. I myself wasn't too ceremonious with broads either - took any, soon as something stirred. Went left and right. Kids... hell knows, maybe there were some, I didn't give a damn honestly, I wasn't gonna saddle myself with anyone anyway...\nThen lived with others too... Generally, I tried not to get into serious business. Well it happened, yeah, we quietly took apartments, stole cars if the opportunity arose. But everything like that - not serious, didn't take anything from known people. That's why I got away with everything. I wasn't some hardened criminal in life, I just always knew how to cleverly work everything so I wouldn't show up anywhere. I managed to set up deals so that I didn't even have a single arrest. But... Even old women stumble sometimes. The devil made me get mixed up with drugs! If only I'd known right away what I was getting into! I told myself - don't get into this business... But it turned out that I both lost the goods and pissed away the money. Stupidly. If I'd known right away what they had me carrying, I'd never have taken it. But now... Had to tear claws to the Zone, because they surrounded me from all sides, nowhere to go. Some demand money, others the goods, and cops got on my tail, and if they arrest me, they'll pin so much dealing on me that I'd spend the rest of my life in the zone... So I chose a different Zone. Had to choose...</text></string>
<string id="final_bandit_dialog_8"><text>Don't blame yourself, the main thing is you finally remembered who you are...</text></string>
<string id="final_bandit_dialog_9"><text>You think what I just told you is the main thing? You think this has some meaning for me now? This is all not the main thing.</text></string>
<string id="final_bandit_dialog_10"><text>I don't understand... This is what you were striving for...</text></string>
<string id="final_bandit_dialog_11"><text>You wouldn't understand. I wasn't striving to remember, I was striving to realize myself. Now I understand this clearly. All these personal details - where I was born, where I studied, where I got married - unimportant. What's important is that I finally realized who I really am, what I'm like...\nAnd the conclusion isn't joyful: my whole life is some kind of complete debauchery and revelry. I spent money not earned by me, I wore things not bought by me, I had women not belonging to me... I lived like a parasite, in my whole life I created nothing at all, I only used others' stuff - stolen, taken quietly or grabbed by force. I thought that sleeping with another's woman was normal, that squandering another's was normal, that taking another's was also normal... My whole life - revelry and DEBAUCHERY... And nothing more. This is a stupid life.</text></string>
<string id="final_bandit_dialog_12"><text>I think you're exaggerating because you're probably too demanding of yourself. From your story I see that you weren't planning to live a debauched life, there wasn't this in you originally. You didn't sink so low as to consider crime normal. You understood that living like this was wrong, meaning something in you was bright. And you were ready to get on the right path. But for some reason you made such a strange conclusion.</text></string>
<string id="final_bandit_dialog_13"><text>What difference does it make why this conclusion? Maybe I'm too self-critical, maybe I'm too suspicious and made this up for myself, maybe Monolith suggested this to me, maybe I dreamed this... You still understood nothing. I could have pretended, deceived myself, told myself that it's not me, that I'm not like that, it's not mine. But why? For me CERTAINTY about myself is important. Before I was constantly uncertain, didn't understand what from "memories" was mine and what wasn't, wasn't sure what I was like, what drove me... Now I know. And it doesn't matter why this feeling appeared, and whether it corresponds to what YOU see in me. The main thing - I'm now certain who I am and what I'm like. I finally understood MYSELF.</text></string>

<string id="final_spec_dialog_00"><text>What do you want to know, Doctor?</text></string>
<string id="final_spec_dialog_0"><text>So what did you understand about yourself? Did you remember everything?</text></string>
<string id="final_spec_dialog_1"><text>Can anyone remember everything? Nobody can remember every moment in life... Yes, I remembered some things, but that's not the main thing, the main thing is I understood who I am.</text></string>
<string id="final_spec_dialog_2"><text>Tell me.</text></string>
<string id="final_spec_dialog_3"><text>Why do you need this? This is my life, I needed to understand this, not you... You wanted me to understand myself, I understood... But anyway, if you want to know, I'll tell you...\nWe lived with my parents on the outskirts of the city - in a private sector. Father was practically a non-drinking man, he was from somewhere in the Baltics. Mother from Siberia. They worked together at some company. My parents spoiled me too much, and all because they rarely saw me. Either they had a joint business trip, or they had a joint tourist trip, or something else joint, and I was in the care of grandmothers and grandfathers. And from their side complete lack of control - do what you want, so I was an independent kid...\nI loved very much in childhood to go to the shooting gallery - father often took me when he was home. I also loved school trips. Our town was small, half an hour walk - and you're already in the forest outside town... And later in life I walked a lot on foot. So from childhood I was used to long marches, to Spartan camping conditions, to independence... Well, and I loved weapons. In childhood I didn't need anything, no cars, no toys - just a new pistol. I collected all kinds of postcards, stamps with weapons. I carved very similar copies from wood by pictures. I liked holding "weapons" in my hands, even if toy ones... In short, what's there to tell...</text></string>
<string id="final_spec_dialog_4"><text>Continue, I'm interested.</text></string>
<string id="final_spec_dialog_5"><text>Then I remember applying to maritime college, wanted to sail. But my independence didn't allow me then to accept barracks life and I quickly quit... Even funny, I later in life chose exactly barracks. In the army I got into special forces. To say that they drove us hard would be to say nothing. They just kept us in black body. But I liked it. I liked the uniform, I liked this languid fatigue by the end of the day when you fall asleep like dead, I liked showing off in front of others. And I liked strength, I liked flexing muscles and showing what you are...\nAfter the army I, of course, signed a contract. This wasn't surprising. I learned a lot in the army, could do a lot, knew a lot. But all this knowledge wasn't for peaceful measured life. Well then training in camps - that's what we called them - we asserted ourselves there in our own way, sometimes with fistfights, couldn't do without it. I already perfectly understood that strength decides everything. And then service. I was in hot spots, was in "peaceful dispersal" of protesters, and hostage liberation, all kinds of things...\nWith family it didn't work out. All women are fools. At least those who crossed my path. I got married, of course, to one, but then we scattered. She also turned out to be a brainless chicken...</text></string>
<string id="final_spec_dialog_6"><text>What's next?</text></string>
<string id="final_spec_dialog_7"><text>Well what's next... Service, assignments. Should I tell you all cases or what? And then I left. There was mass reduction of units, well I also got "reduced" under this deal. I wanted it myself, got tired of everything. I still preferred independent loner life. Got a job at a private security firm, and then... Then someone "raised" my cases, dug into the past and realized I could do something. They met with me and offered to take on one not very legal business... The first couple of clients were handled cleanly - no noise, no dust. I knew my business. Moral principles didn't worry me much - work is work, everything in this world costs something, and everyone costs something...\nAnd then the last "order". I don't even know why I agreed. Got greedy for a big score, or maybe wanted something "spicy", to play cat and mouse? Or finally use to the fullest everything I knew how to do. The job wasn't simple - the target was too noticeable a figure, constantly under guard, getting to him wasn't simple. But I managed... And at some moment I suddenly realized that I also "cost" something. I understood it with my gut, sixth sense... I was forced to go somewhere, dissolve somewhere. I chose the Zone... Now I think that wasn't the best choice...</text></string>
<string id="final_spec_dialog_8"><text>Don't blame yourself, the main thing is you finally remembered who you are...</text></string>
<string id="final_spec_dialog_9"><text>You think what I just told you is the main thing? You think this has some meaning for me now? This is all not the main thing.</text></string>

All these personal details - where I was born, where I studied, where I got married - unimportant. What's important is that I finally realized who I really am, what I'm like...\nAnd the conclusion isn't joyful: my whole life I was driven by cruelty, which eventually grew into uncontrolled anger. I always believed that strength decides everything. But how to have strength and not use it? Of course, I used it, I demonstrated strength, I showed myself as I could... Now I see that this was stupid, foolish violence, causeless cruelty and hatred. I didn't just perform my work, I hated those who were against me, who contradicted me, who stood in my way. But this was stupid causeless hatred, causeless cruelty. My whole life I was controlled by some kind of stupid senseless ANGER, and nothing more...</text></string>
<string id="final_spec_dialog_12"><text>You're greatly exaggerating because you're too demanding of yourself. From your story I see that you were always independent, you strived to achieve results at any cost, you never gave up. What's bad about that? You had positive qualities - determination, desire to win no matter what, but for some reason you made such a strange conclusion.</text></string>

<string id="final_hunter_dialog_00"><text>What do you want to know, Doctor?</text></string>
<string id="final_hunter_dialog_0"><text>So what did you understand about yourself? Did you remember everything?</text></string>
<string id="final_hunter_dialog_1"><text>Can anyone remember everything? Nobody can remember every moment in life... Yes, I remembered some things, but that's not the main thing, the main thing is I understood who I am.</text></string>

<string id="final_hunter_dialog_3"><text>Why do you need this? This is my life, I needed to understand this, not you... You wanted me to understand myself, I understood... But anyway, if you want to know, I'll tell you...\nIn childhood we lived in the north. Around the city was forest, and we always went to that forest for blueberries, for cranberries, for mushrooms. And if you went farther somewhere, there were really remote places - taiga. You could easily meet a bear nose to nose. I even remember such a case from childhood. My father and I were gathering some berries, well we met a bear. But he had no time for us then - we parted ways...\nI loved the forest, loved going for mushrooms, loved going fishing. I loved different children's camps too, there you could go somewhere on a hike. Well and generally life there wasn't like with parents. I remember, often went to my uncle's logging site, went hunting with him, he taught me everything. And for my 18th birthday he gave me my first rifle. True, then I rarely went to him, and then stopped altogether. He was offended at me for leaving his favorite dog in the forest, and wolves tore her apart... In short, what's there to tell...</text></string>
<string id="final_hunter_dialog_4"><text>Continue, I'm interested.</text></string>
<string id="final_hunter_dialog_5"><text>Then went to the army. I consider that I didn't spend time there in vain, especially since I didn't serve just anywhere, but in "ranger" units. But they just called us rangers. Actually we weren't any rangers - ordinary army, but for historical reasons some regiment was very famous. Normal service, at that time they just started checking all units for hazing. I remember a case when they demoted one sergeant to private for this and sent him to the supply unit. And deservedly so, to be honest...\nWell then. Then worked as a game warden in one reserve. True, not for long, I didn't get along there, well and one accident happened - shot a comrade in the leg, in general, everyone turned against me then, had to leave... I generally didn't get along with people somehow. My wife also left on her own, together with daughter. True, first she threw me out, supposedly kicked me out of the house for cheating. And what cheating, well I fooled around on the side, happens to everyone. But she's very principled, uncompromising... But I'm principled too - the apartment's in my name, why should I leave, if they don't like it - let them leave. So we scattered, and I won the apartment in court...\nThen worked in the north at a procurement office, and in the east in the Ussuri taiga. I wandered around Russia to my heart's content... What else to do. I'm alone, sitting in one place is boring. Well and I couldn't work long in one collective either, either you don't get along with one, or with another. So I wandered...</text></string>
<string id="final_hunter_dialog_6"><text>And then?</text></string>
<string id="final_hunter_dialog_7"><text>What then? Everything got tiresome, to be honest. Boring - everything in life became. Both in the city boring, and in the forest already not the same. You sit half a year alone in a one-room Khrushchev apartment and just wait for hunting season to open... Then half a year in the forest, also alone - I don't like partners, everyone's always dissatisfied with something, this isn't right, that isn't right. Better alone, but sometimes boring. Everything bored me, I needed to somehow shake myself up, start some new business, try myself in something extraordinary. Otherwise you can drink yourself to death or hang yourself from boredom. And here they were recruiting hunters to work in the Zone. I learned later - some institutes and private clinics sponsored an unusual project. They needed diverse genetic material, and such that you can't find in an ordinary forest. For very unusual genetic material they need very unusual little beasts that live in a very unusual zone. And hunters were needed who weren't simple either. In general, just for me something new, interesting, unexplored before. Only this could dispel my boredom. And of course, I signed up... Fool. If I'd known what I was getting into, I'd never have gotten involved in such "hunting"...</text></string>
<string id="final_hunter_dialog_8"><text>Don't blame yourself, the main thing is you finally remembered who you are...</text></string>

All these personal details - where I was born, where I studied, where I got married - unimportant. What's important is that I finally realized who I really am, what I'm like...\nAnd the conclusion isn't joyful: my whole life is essentially a series of deceptions and betrayals. Everyone who had dealings with me, I deceived one way or another. I cheated even on the closest people. Everyone eventually turned away from me - and rightly so, how can you live with a deceiver who screws you over at every step and justifies it every time with "circumstances". Nobody wanted to deal with me. Because my life credo is BETRAYAL.</text></string>
<string id="final_hunter_dialog_12"><text>You're greatly exaggerating because you're too demanding of yourself. From your story I see that you loved nature, traveled a lot, didn't waste life in idleness. What's bad about that?

<string id="final_igrok_dialog_3"><text>Why do you need this? This is my life, I needed to understand this, not you... You wanted me to understand myself, I understood... But anyway, if you want to know, I'll tell you...\nI spent my childhood in one southern town. We all played together in the yard. I remember we baked potatoes in bonfires in the yards... Normal childhood in general. Only my parents interested me little. Mother kept trying to raise me. I don't remember father at all. Mother said he never existed. She then tried to somehow arrange her life, well and stepfather appeared. I was afraid of him. He was a man of harsh temper, slightest thing wrong - a cuff to the head. Then he left us and seemingly drank himself to death...\nIn those times they started installing all kinds of gaming machines in every store, we still called them scam machines. And then they even organized a real gaming club. I went in somehow... and never came out, so to speak. The game captivated me, possessed me so much that I didn't think about anything else. I always liked the game, liked this anticipation of luck, this fortune... Though the first big loss strongly shook my consciousness. I couldn't understand how such a thing was possible. I always wanted to be financially independent, and here I started getting into debt. And what debt - I seriously thought about where I could steal money. And for what? To spend on the game... In short, what's there to tell...</text></string>
<string id="final_igrok_dialog_4"><text>Continue, I'm interested.</text></string>
<string id="final_igrok_dialog_5"><text>But thank God I didn't sink to theft - got drafted into the army. Not service, but boredom and bonded life. Good thing at least I didn't have to think about where to get money for the game. One entertainment - shooting twice a month. I even invented a game then - who faster, more accurately and technically puts down all targets. We played among ourselves, between squads, pair by pair, young against old... Different ways. In general, the only good memory about the army...\nThen I married foolishly. But family life didn't work out. Wife and her sisters, and more the mother-in-law, nagged every day that I bring nothing to the house, that I lose all money in the machines... Not a family, but a sawmill. I left them...\nLater computer clubs already appeared in our shabby town. There I understood that you can not just play, you can earn with your mind. This isn't just stupid hope for chance, for a lucky combination. No. Poker or preference - this is strategy, this is a thinking process, well and plus luck. I never considered myself a fool, whatever mother-in-law said. So I switched to card games...</text></string>
<string id="final_igrok_dialog_6"><text>And then what?</text></string>
<string id="final_igrok_dialog_7"><text>Same thing. In streaks - sometimes lucky, sometimes not. Either you hit the jackpot and live it up, or you borrow, beg, pawn something... And so in waves. But I was waiting for my chance, I was always sure that sooner or later the bird of luck would sit on my shoulder too. And then I'd grab it and never let it out of my hands...\nAnd one day I hit the "jackpot". That's what I thought then. After some raid on our club in a garden nearby I found a suitcase stuffed with bucks. The raid wasn't for nothing - someone gave a tip that the club was covered by drug dealers. Understanding and connecting the events wasn't difficult, I perfectly understood what this money was and why so much in one place, but there was no strength to refuse it. But how to live with money and not playing? Of course, they noticed me, noticed what stakes I was making, connected events and facts and understood that this money didn't fall from heaven... Then a black streak began. There was a serious conversation with serious people, they demanded to return "someone else's", otherwise... By that time I had less than a quarter of that sum left. And I decided to win it back. And then I bet everything on the bank... But I lost...\nWhat was the point of killing me? You can't get anything from the dead. And they just sent me to the Zone. To work off the debt. Everything was like in a fog there, so I don't remember how they arranged everything, probably they pumped me with something then, because I "gifted" them the apartment, and all remaining savings... everything I had. Such an idiotic life of an ordinary idiot...</text></string>
<string id="final_igrok_dialog_8"><text>Don't blame yourself, the main thing is you finally remembered who you are...</text></string>

All these personal details - where I was born, where I studied, where I got married - unimportant. What's important is that I finally realized who I really am, what I'm like...\nAnd the conclusion isn't joyful: in my whole life I never worked anywhere. Laziness and idleness - that's my life motto. I never thought about work, about honest labor. I always strived for easy money and easy life. I easily spent sums that I didn't earn myself, I didn't even think that money doesn't come for free, but for some kind of labor. It seemed to me that money was obligated to fall at my feet just like that. I wasn't planning to work for it somehow, I just made bets and waited for a miracle... In my whole life I never lifted a finger. My life is IDLENESS and nothing more.</text></string>

<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_1"><text>Exactly, I'm looking. Or rather, we're looking. And you're probably the first this concerns. In all senses.</text></string>

<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_3"><text>Alright, alright... Anyway, about those document fragments you dragged from the laboratory in Dark Valley.\nWe consulted with smart people here and came to the conclusion that we might be able to make some protection from the "Brain Scorcher's" effect. Like a helmet. Only not everything's clear.</text></string>
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_4"><text>So what? Make it. What's the problem?</text></string>
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_5"><text>Not enough data! You only brought one volume out of several. Judging by existing references in this volume, the data we need is in others. Only where are they, all these papers? Also, fragmentary data is reported in documents that got to stalkers from the destroyed evacuation convoy. Several sheets from there you also brought to Sidorovich along with some album, remember?</text></string>
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_6"><text>Yeah. And why the hell do you need me? You've got a whole spetsnaz nearby, all kinds of generals with colonels... Let them search.</text></string>
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_7"><text>They did search! Sent two groups of guys armed to the teeth! One in Dark Valley fell in a skirmish with bandits, the other... Nothing known about the other. Somewhere in the Gut they vanished into thin air. But it would be logical to comb through all surroundings of the destroyed convoy once more...\nIt's not force that's needed in this business, but skill. Skill to survive, skill to assess the situation, skill to find a way to negotiate.\nYou managed to get into the underground, into that very X-18 where this whole mess was cooked up. Try once more. Docent says that if computer blocks remained there, you can check the hard drives in them.</text></string> 
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_71"><text>Whether there were computers there or not, I don't remember...</text></string>
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_72"><text>You search there carefully, these things look like:\n</text></string>
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_73"><text>That's if I go there.</text></string>
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_74"><text>So go. Try it. According to Docent, there were at least three computers there that could have the information we're interested in. And definitely drop by the Gut. I feel in my gut, not everything's been carted away there yet.\nIf it works out, we'll be able to make protection - then opportunities will open up for everyone! For us, for stalkers, and for you.</text></string>
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_8"><text>If I agree, then I need equipment. And this... in that X-18 a flamethrower would be very useful. You wouldn't happen to have one?</text></string>
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_9"><text>A flamethrower?! What the hell do you need it for?</text></string>
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_10"><text>There are dozens of those flying creatures there, poltergeists, about ten per level. Fire against such evil is just the thing, isn't it?</text></string>
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_11"><text>Ah... I don't know, I don't know. One stalker dropped by here once, long time ago though. He had this... lighter. He bragged - monsters burn from it like matches. In a drunken frenzy he chased rats around the bar, almost started a fire. He said that Screw, a Freedom drunk, personally cobbled this thing for him. And later a rumor went around that on Wild Territory a bloodsucker finished off this flamethrower guy, along with that piece of iron. Apparently not all monsters burn equally well. Heh-heh...</text></string>
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_12"><text>On Wild... Well, throw me some gear anyway.</text></string>
<string id="barman_return_x18_1_dialog_13"><text>Everyone needs something. You're not the only clever one. I already sent ten volunteers searching. And I'll send many more. So think - should I shower each one with goods without being sure that these goods will be put to use?\nFind something useful, then we'll talk more specifically about reward. Well if not - then not. Understand? Anyway, I've said everything, whether to go somewhere and search for something is for you to decide.</text></string>

<string id="barman_dar_document3_have_dialog_0"><text>About documents from the convoy that's in the Gut.</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document3_have_dialog_1"><text>Got something worthwhile? Otherwise one wise guy here tried to foist old accounting files on me under the guise of something interesting... I hope you don't take me for a fool?</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document3_have_dialog_21"><text>Haven't given you reason so far. Joke. Anyway, I think I found what you need. Here, see for yourself.</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document3_have_dialog_22"><text>Nothing yet... I'll go take another look, perhaps.</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document3_have_dialog_31"><text>Yes, looks like it. To say for sure, I need time.\nWhat else? Ah, yes... I owe you a treat. Here: drinks, snacks, and water, in case you get thirsty. Just make sure no drunken brawls here at my place.</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document3_have_dialog_32"><text>Go on, go on. Go... We're doing common business after all.</text></string>

<string id="barman_dar_document5_have_dialog_0"><text>About hard drives from the underground.</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document5_have_dialog_1"><text>Found something or what?</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document5_have_dialog_21"><text>I went down into that lab once more. Look what I managed to find.</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document5_have_dialog_22"><text>Nothing yet, but I remember your request. I'll get your drives for sure... later.</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document5_have_dialog_31"><text>Hmm... Yeah, brought all three pieces. That's good. Now I need time to figure out what's what there. We'll think it over.\nI owe you a glass of red... Just kidding, kidding. I promised a reward - choose. Want a recipe? Very useful artifact comes out. Or give you an artifact... a very good one?</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document5_have_dialog_32"><text>Don't drag it out, Marked One, with this business. What if someone else wants to rummage in the lab after you? They might take out the last thing of any value...</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document5_have_dialog_41"><text>Give me the recipe. I'll see what useful comes out there.</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document5_have_dialog_42"><text>Give me the artifact. I'll see how good it is.</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document5_have_dialog_51"><text>I'll upload the information to your PDA.</text></string>
<string id="barman_dar_document5_have_dialog_52"><text>Good one, don't doubt it.</text></string>

<string id="mar_boryan_start_dialog_101"><text>Oh, hello. How's life treating you... What hurts?</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_start_dialog_102"><text>Hmm. Hurts? Well, it aches. Why suddenly?</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_start_dialog_103"><text>Suddenly? First time here or what? I'm Boryan. Everyone knows me. I help with all kinds of ailments. What's your name?</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_start_dialog_104"><text>I'm Marked One. Boryan? Doctor? Swamp? Another one?</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_start_dialog_105"><text>You mean him, the Swamp Doctor? No. He showed me some things, gave advice. He wasn't here, not in our swamp - somewhere on the other side, from the Belarusian sector of the Zone. And I'm like - gathering herbs, drying them. Good tinctures come from them. For hemorrhoids, boils... Also so the guts work normally. Otherwise, from the local life, as they say, if not diarrhea, then scrofula... Helps people, so they thank me with what they can.</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_start_dialog_106"><text>Well. I don't know. Boils don't seem to bother me and everything's fine with my stomach. But I'll keep it in mind.</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_start_dialog_107"><text>Keep it, keep it. If anything - come to me. And if you're ever nearby on business - drop by, sometimes need to pass herbs to someone sick. You take them - you'll be thanked. You'll earn something.</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_start_dialog_201"><text>What wind brought you to our Swamps? Health in order? Well okay...</text></string>

<string id="mar_boryan_what_need_dialog_0"><text>Well, what do you usually need?</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_what_need_dialog_1"><text>Me? Hmm... Nothing, I guess. I mean from what stalkers could offer.\nThough...\nThere's something I sometimes need. You heard about the local hunters' sausage?</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_what_need_dialog_2"><text>Uh... Yeah, smells pretty strong...</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_what_need_dialog_3"><text>Yeah, that's right. But for some healer recipes I invented, I need a broth from such sausage. So if you have their sausage, bring it, it'll be useful.</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_what_need_dialog_4"><text>Really? And what in exchange?</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_what_need_dialog_5"><text>I have a small supply of medicine. The soldiers here, nearby, by the tower, often drop by. Sometimes bloating, sometimes constipation, and sometimes diarrhea happens. I brew them decoctions, and they throw me some drugs. Drop by them if you haven't been yet, they're tight on food. Maybe you can help each other somehow.\nSo I'll trade sausage for medicine. Bring a couple sausages - get antirad or I'll give you an army medical kit. Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_what_need_dialog_6"><text>Hmm, I'll think about it. Maybe.</text></string>

<string id="mar_boryan_green_kolbasa_dialog_0"><text>I have hunting sausage...</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_green_kolbasa_dialog_1"><text>Yeah, that's good. Medkit or antirad? What will you take?</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_green_kolbasa_dialog_21"><text>Here's a couple sausages, I'll take the medkit.</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_green_kolbasa_dialog_22"><text>I'll take antirad, here's a couple sausages.</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_green_kolbasa_dialog_23"><text>I'll think about it for now. Maybe later.</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_green_kolbasa_dialog_31"><text>Well, here, take the medkit. Maybe you have more sausages? Will you take medicine?</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_green_kolbasa_dialog_32"><text>Yeah, here you go. I have more drugs. Well? Trading?</text></string>

<string id="red_borzyi_pda_dialog_0"><text>You said you'd push PDAs for money?</text></string>
<string id="red_borzyi_pda_dialog_1"><text>For a thousand bucks - I'll give five. For two grand, wholesale - a dozen. And for four grand - twenty-five devices.</text></string>
<string id="red_borzyi_pda_dialog_21"><text>Alright, here's a check for a thousand.</text></string>
<string id="red_borzyi_pda_dialog_22"><text>Wholesale? Here are checks for two thousand bucks.</text></string>
<string id="red_borzyi_pda_dialog_23"><text>Wow! Then here are the checks. Four thousand.</text></string>
<string id="red_borzyi_pda_dialog_24"><text>I'll wait. Maybe later.</text></string>
<string id="red_borzyi_pda_dialog_31"><text>Well, man! Here you go - one, two, three, four, five... A woodpecker went out for a walk... If you need more - come by...</text></string>
<string id="red_borzyi_pda_dialog_32"><text>You're quite the dealer... Here, as I said, all twelve. If you need more - drop by.</text></string>
<string id="red_borzyi_pda_dialog_33"><text>You're a banker, as I see... Money to burn! Why even sit in the Zone with such cash? Silent? Well, your business. Here, take it, as promised.</text></string>
<string id="red_borzyi_pda_dialog_41"><text>Woodpecker? Well, well...</text></string>
<string id="red_borzyi_pda_dialog_42"><text>Yeah, I'll drop by...</text></string>
<string id="red_borzyi_pda_dialog_43"><text>I need to. That's why I'm here.</text></string>

<string id="part_exchanger_kidney_dialog_0"><text>Need an electrochimera kidney, urgently.</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_kidney_dialog_11"><text>Wow, look at you getting worked up! Urgently! Kidney! Eh... You know how hard it is to take down an electrochimera? A couple brave souls, the rest already - greased their heels to the heavens... On the mainland you can get bi-i-ig money for such a kidney.</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_kidney_dialog_21"><text>Well... Since we're talking money: how much?</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_kidney_dialog_31"><text>Let's say... If we figure it out. Anyway... Alright! Just for you and just today! An attraction of unseen generosity: one thousand bucks! Can you handle it?</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_kidney_dialog_12"><text>I already said: a thousand in currency! Deal?</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_kidney_dialog_41"><text>Alright, need the kidney. Here's the check.</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_kidney_dialog_42"><text>Hold onto it for now, I'll come back with a check for that amount.</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_kidney_dialog_51"><text>Yeah. I undersold it, however. Alright. A man said it - a man did it! Take it, got it by chance. Don't mind that it's a bit wilted...</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_kidney_dialog_52"><text>I'll hold it. But not for long! I have a couple enthusiasts for this business, just don't feel like going anywhere right now...</text></string>

<string id="plichko_rpk_dialog_0"><text>Hey there. Why so ruffled?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_dialog_1"><text>You'd be ruffled here too... Listen, Marked One, help me out a bit with one thing. You're a nimble guy, shouldn't be any problems.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_dialog_2"><text>What are you talking about?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_dialog_3"><text>Well, see, I'm defending this checkpoint, but I don't have serious weapons. Right now there's no "heavy artillery" in the warehouse, and mutants, you see yourself, come in packs... Lately they've gone completely crazy. Look, last night a pack of pseudodogs almost broke through, barely stayed alive...</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_dialog_4"><text>I understand... And what do you suggest?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_dialog_5"><text>Get an RPK machine gun. With this baby even a mouse won't slip through here, we'll mow down all this scum from a kilometer away. And you won't be at a loss either, the road here will become cleaner. Including for you. Well, and don't worry about the reward, of course. So how about it, will you get the machine gun?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_dialog_6"><text>And where am I supposed to get you an RPK?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_dialog_7"><text>At Agroprom there's a warrant officer, called Sherstyuk. You can get proper gear from him, military stuff, straight from the warehouse. He really respects vodka. Try to make a deal with him. Just don't drag it out too long. As reward I'll give you medicine and grenades. We have plenty of that stuff.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_dialog_8"><text>Alright, we'll see. If it works out, I'll bring the machine gun.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_dialog_9"><text>No, I won't get involved in this business.</text></string>
<string id="tex_plichko_rpk"><text>Plichko, a Duty member at the Bar, asked to find him an RPK machine gun to more effectively hold the approaches to the Bar</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_dialog_0"><text>So, still defending everything? Got you a machine gun. This baby's a beast!</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_dialog_11"><text>Thanks, Marked One. You really helped me out! Let's get it over here quickly. Now we won't let the enemy through and you'll walk more peacefully on the road.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_dialog_12"><text>And where are the bullets? I bet there were armor-piercing ones too, you kept them for yourself? What am I supposed to shoot with?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_dialog_2"><text>In your joy, you didn't forget about the reward?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_dialog_3"><text>Here's what was promised. As we agreed.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_dialog_4"><text>Ten grenades and five medkits for a new RPK?!</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_dialog_5"><text>Also write down the recipe, Duty pays its debts.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_dialog_6"><text>This, of course, changes things, but next time I'll think... Is it even worth it?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_dialog_7"><text>Don't get worked up, we'll load it now.</text></string>

<string id="tex_sidor_conserv"><text>\nSidorovich asked to bring a package from the pig farm behind the embankment</text></string>
<string id="sidor_conserv_start_0"><text>Maybe I can go somewhere else, bring what's needed?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_conserv_start_1"><text>There's one trivial little matter. At the farm behind the embankment, my guys left me a batch of goods. The young punks from the village didn't come close, got scared, the youth. Recently fleshes settled there. But you, I see, are a risky guy, would go take a look. Will you take it on, or should I look for someone else?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_conserv_start_2"><text>I'll take it. I'm not in a hurry anywhere for now.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_conserv_start_3"><text>No, ask others.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_conserv_start_4"><text>That's settled then. And I'll figure out in the meantime how to reward you.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_conserv_done_0"><text>I was at the farm, found your goods.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_conserv_done_1"><text>And how is it there?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_conserv_done_2"><text>Fleshes tore your courier apart. And you could have warned me about a whole crate. Barely managed to carry it.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_conserv_done_3"><text>Well-well, what are you complaining about, sickly... Here's for the work...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_conserv_done_4"><text>Could have shared a couple cans. Otherwise here you'll stretch your legs from hunger without any fleshes.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_conserv_done_5"><text>Want to eat? Fine, you convinced me, otherwise really... you'll die before your time. And here, take this sawed-off too, it's just lying under the table doing nothing. I used it here at first, when I was still setting up this little room, chased rats with it, been lying there since then.</text></string>

<string id="tex_sidor_kishka"><text>\nSidorovich asked to bring some sausage for testing from Ignat, who is in the Gut</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_0"><text>Sidorovich, maybe throw me another easy job?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_1"><text>Hmm... Look at you, "easy". Have you been to the "Gut"? Talked with the hunters at the old sawmill?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_111"><text>Hmm... Look at you, "easy". Heard about the "Gut", the local hunters, the sawmill?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_112"><text>Nimble mentioned that it was because of this "Gut" that he had all his troubles.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_113"><text>Should eat less crap. Troubles he has... Got the whole area up in arms. Anyway... So, now about the "Gut", listen carefully.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_114"><text>Sidorovich, I'm listening, don't drag it out.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_115"><text>The boss at that sawmill is Ignat, go to him. They, the hunters, set up sausage production there, should bring some for testing. Nobody decent will dare eat it anyway for now, but we can test the "excrement" on Wolf's loafers. They don't give a damn what to chase vodka with.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_2"><text>Well, yes. Ignat is their boss there.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_3"><text>Just to this Ignat I have business. They set up sausage production there, should bring some for testing. We'll test the "excrement" on Wolf's loafers. They don't give a damn what to chase vodka with.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_4"><text>Sidorovich, didn't you think that from indigestion they might mess up your whole bunker? I don't see any other latrines around here.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_5"><text>You, Marked One, watch your tongue. I'm still being nice, that's why I'm having conversations with you. Otherwise Stasik there can instantly instill respect for elders.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_6"><text>Yeah, don't get worked up. What needs to be done?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_7"><text>I'll give you a good artifact, and you try to trade it for sausage. How you make a deal with Ignat is your business. Just keep in mind: if you decide to pocket the artifact and go about your business, spitting on my task - you'll regret it. I'm waiting for news for two days, and then... I'm not the "UN", of course, but sanctions will follow, don't doubt it. Do such conditions suit you?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_8"><text>I don't like being rushed. What if something goes wrong and I don't meet the deadline?! No way, look for others.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_9"><text>Alright, I agree. Only they probably demand payment for passage to the "Gut". And back too.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_10"><text>Marked One, you can shoot dog tails on the way yourself. Or should I run there?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_11"><text>You convinced me, give me your artifact.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_12"><text>No way, let your potential test subjects chase the mutts.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_13"><text>Take the artifact and medicine for the road. Just look - don't lose the artifact. We'll talk about reward later. And remember: you have two days. Time's ticking.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_start_14"><text>How businesslike we are. You'll get your sausage.</text></string>

<string id="ignat_kishka_start_0"><text>Ignat, I'm here on business, from Sidorovich.</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_1"><text>And what does that old geezer want?</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_2"><text>He wants to take some of your sausage for testing. Arrange a belly feast for the boys in the village. Heh-heh...</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_3"><text>Why such generosity? The sausage isn't cheap... Or something else?</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_4"><text>Don't know, he asked me to find out about a batch. I came to ask. Where he puts it is his business. So what do you want for the sausage?</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_5"><text>What do I want? And what does he offer? Huh?</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_51"><text>He told me to give you an artifact as payment.</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_52"><text>He said you'd figure it out on the spot. Says you surely have some task. I do for you, you do for me. Well, you get it.</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_511"><text>Really? Well, show me what that miser spent on.</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_5111"><text>Here, take it.</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_5112"><text>Actually, you know... I could use this artifact myself. Any other options? Sidor hinted that you might have some task. I'd help you, you'd help me. How about it?</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_6"><text>Well, the artifact's not bad. I'll give ten sausages for testing. And tell Sidor that if he decides to take a bigger batch, the payment will be appropriate, he won't get away with just artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_7"><text>Alright, I'll pass it on. See you.</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_8"><text>What an old schemer. Well... I have one matter. At the northern station, not far from here, a group of our hunters is keeping watch. Need to take them a package, buckshot, food, and some vodka. And bring me some monster stuff from them. If you take it on, I'll give Sidor ten sausages for testing. So, how about it?</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_9"><text>Something doesn't appeal to me about this idea. How about the artifact? Look what Sidorovich provided me with to make you more agreeable.</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_10"><text>If it's really not far, I'll take a walk, what the hell.</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_11"><text>Heh-heh... Take a walk, take a walk. Ask for Kitayets there. Take this box.</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_start_12"><text>Heavy, damn thing. Well, I'm off.</text></string>

<string id="hunter_nikitin_dialog_0"><text>I'm from Ignat, brought a package.</text></string>
<string id="hunter_nikitin_dialog_1"><text>Yeah, we've been waiting, give it here.</text></string>
<string id="hunter_nikitin_dialog_2"><text>Take the box. Ignat said you'd have a package for him too.</text></string>
<string id="hunter_nikitin_dialog_3"><text>Yes, there's something, shot a bit. Will you manage to carry it?</text></string>
<string id="hunter_nikitin_dialog_4"><text>I'll manage, don't worry.</text></string>

<string id="ignat_kishka_done_0"><text>Ignat, you bastard!</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_done_1"><text>Why are you yelling for the whole area to hear?</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_done_2"><text>You could have warned me that there are monsters there like sardines in a can!</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_done_3"><text>Get used to it, Marked One, this is the Zone, not some "taking a walk"...</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_done_4"><text>Alright, never mind. Here's the package, give me the sausage... I'm going.</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_done_5"><text>I'll give ten sausages for testing. And tell Sidor that if he decides to take a bigger batch, the payment will be appropriate, need to discuss it separately.</text></string>
<string id="ignat_kishka_done_6"><text>Alright, I'll pass it on. See you.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_kishka_done_0"><text>I was at Ignat's. He gave ten sausages.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_done_1"><text>You showed up, didn't get dusty. I was already thinking they chopped you up for sausage yourself. Why so few? Or did you already kill all the monsters in the Gut, huh?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_done_2"><text>There are plenty of monsters there. Ignat said this is for testing, if you order a batch, the payment will need to be discussed separately. Take your sausage.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_done_3"><text>Look how everyone's become so enterprising. Penny-pinchers.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_done_4"><text>Look who's talking. You didn't forget about the reward?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_done_51"><text>I remember, take it, everything's useful in the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_kishka_done_52"><text>I remember, take it, everything's useful in the Zone.</text></string>

<string id="mar_boryan_drunk_quest_dialog_0"><text>You know Brom? There's such a wayward Duty member.</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_drunk_quest_dialog_1"><text>How can you remember everyone... So, what about your Brom?</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_drunk_quest_dialog_2"><text>He's not mine, but I have an interest in him. He's asking for help. Says only your tinctures are his remaining hope. He drinks heavily, doesn't know moderation. Any moment now they'll kick him out of Duty, if they haven't already...</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_drunk_quest_dialog_3"><text>There are those without moderation, like half the Zone. It seems to give relief, but many stalkers die doing drunk things. Yes, it's trouble... And what do you need from me?</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_drunk_quest_dialog_4"><text>Well, maybe some decoction or tincture? I don't know, you're the healer.</text></string>

<string id="mar_boryan_drunk_quest_dialog_6"><text>Hmm, I'll think about it. Maybe.</text></string>

<string id="mar_boryan_drunk_quest_2_dialog_0"><text>I brought a jar with jellyfish.</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_drunk_quest_2_dialog_1"><text>Yeah, good. Here's a packet with herbs... How to brew what, how much to take - I wrote it on paper, it's inside. Let him drink it for ten days, then either he'll come himself, or send someone... Well, if he's still alive.</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_drunk_quest_2_dialog_2"><text>I see. And for memory, from amnesia, you don't have anything?</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_drunk_quest_2_dialog_3"><text>I deal more with bodily ailments, and memory is a delicate matter, you need a serious specialist for that.</text></string>
<string id="mar_boryan_drunk_quest_2_dialog_4"><text>Well, thanks for that too. I'll go make the drunk happy.</text></string>

<string id="tex_ak_strelok_repair"><text>To repair Strelok's AK, Lisaped needs: AKM assault rifle, SIG SG 552 Commando assault rifle, a check for one thousand dollars. The weapons must be in good condition.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_dialog_0"><text>I got this rifle here, they say it's Strelok's own.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_dialog_1"><text>Can't be! Come on, let me see.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_dialog_2"><text>Look.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_dialog_3"><text>Yeah... interesting, interesting, only this is no longer, you could say, a rifle, but a pile of rusty parts.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_dialog_4"><text>That's why I came to you. Maybe you'll take on repairing it?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_dialog_5"><text>Maybe I will. Honestly, I'm interested to tinker with it myself. By the way, where did you find it?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_dialog_6"><text>In some underground.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_dialog_7"><text>Then it's clear why it's in such condition.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_dialog_8"><text>So, should I throw it out?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_dialog_9"><text>There's always time for that. Give me time to figure it out, think about it, maybe I'll come up with something. I mostly work with standard weapons, and this is such a cannon.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_dialog_10"><text>So when should I come by?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_dialog_11"><text>Come by tomorrow, about the same time.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_dialog_12"><text>I won't bother you, get to work.</text></string>

<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_0"><text>So what about Strelok's rifle, figured it out?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_1"><text>I told you how much time I'd need. Not ready to give an answer yet.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_2"><text>I took a look, complex construction. You can tell right away that a skilled master made it.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_3"><text>I know that already. Can you fix it?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_4"><text>I already told you that I mainly work with standard weapons, and this rifle has a lot of non-standard parts. There's both our stuff and western. I can try to restore everything, but I need spare parts and mechanisms. I don't have those right now. Bring them, then we'll discuss.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_5"><text>What do you need? I hope I won't have to rob a military depot.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_6"><text>No. I'll need just a couple rifles. One - AK for 7.62, and the second... something foreign, with a different automation scheme.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_7"><text>More specifically, what exactly?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_8"><text>Then write it down. I need an AKM and... let's say, SIG SG 552 Commando. Practically the same Kalashnikov, only Swiss. Of course, everything must be in good condition. From junk only junk will come out. And my advice to you: don't use Strelok's rifle for now if you hope to fix it. Everything's held together by spit right now. Start shooting - you'll ruin it completely.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_9"><text>Clear. That's all?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_10"><text>For parts - yes. And for the work - a thousand bucks. Check to bearer. You can get one through traders, if you don't know. How's that, suits you?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_111"><text>Lisaped, haven't you lost your mind asking such prices?! Screw such repair. Give back the piece of iron.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_112"><text>You really went overboard! Alright, you'll have both guns and money. I hope it's worth it.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_121"><text>Take it back, could have been a good specimen.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_122"><text>For now take back your scrap metal, and when you gather everything, then come again.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_13"><text>Deal.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_2dialog_14"><text>Got it, I'll come by later.</text></string>

<string id="ak_strelok_repair_3dialog_0"><text>I gathered everything on the list, as you asked.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_3dialog_1"><text>What are you talking about?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_3dialog_2"><text>For repairing Strelok's rifle, we agreed. Here.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_3dialog_3"><text>And the payment?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_3dialog_4"><text>Do the job - you'll get paid.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_3dialog_5"><text>Well... alright, I'll trust you. Come by in a couple days, I think I'll manage.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_3dialog_6"><text>I won't bother you, get to work.</text></string>

<string id="ak_strelok_repair_4dialog_0"><text>How's the repair going, making progress?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_4dialog_11"><text>It's progressing. And it'll progress faster if I'm not distracted by trivialities. Come by later.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_4dialog_12"><text>I'm just... just checking, maybe you need something else.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_4dialog_3"><text>What about payment?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_4dialog_31"><text>Tight on cash, won't you believe in debt?</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_4dialog_32"><text>They only believe in debt in "Duty", but you need to keep your word! We agreed - a check for a thousand bucks for the work.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_4dialog_33"><text>Alright, don't stress, you'll get your check...</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_4dialog_4"><text>Here you go, Kulibina.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_4dialog_5"><text>Yeah, all good. Look what a beauty came out. High rate of fire, accurate, you can put this "Eotech" collimator sight on the sight rail. Comes free in the package - appreciate my kindness. I'm also giving several upgraded magazines with a clever spring of my own design. They fit five more rounds. And take some rounds too, left over from test firing. You can try it out right away.</text></string>
<string id="ak_strelok_repair_4dialog_6"><text>Looks gorgeous, thanks! Let's see how it performs in action.</text></string>
