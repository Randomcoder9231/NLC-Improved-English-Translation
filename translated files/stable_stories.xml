<string id="stalker_story_1"><text>So, we're heading into that hangar. Dust everywhere, cobwebs hanging right down from the ceiling—detectors are acting up, total nonsense, saying not only is there no one around, but that we don't even exist. We started taking positions along the perimeter: Sanya's in front, we're covering... And then—CLANG! A beam, a massive iron, rusty thing from under the roof, snaps and comes crashing down! How Sanya dodged it, he doesn't even know, but that hunk of junk slammed right into the spot where he was standing. Well, once he fell and rolled away, he didn't even try to get up—he just stayed flat on the ground and started blasting! The rest of the guys got spooked too, the idiots, and started spraying lead at nothing. Then Sanya starts screaming something about a creature in the corner. I look—I don't see any creature... Anyway, it was a mess, not an operation but a total clusterfuck... a bordello... We started walking through those ruins; spent about five minutes moving real careful-like, trying not to end up under any more beams. And it's madness, total madness: one guy sees something, then another, and they start dumping half a mag into empty space. Two guys were really unlucky: one was walking on flat ground and suddenly fell into a pit, the second got swiped across the back by a falling door. Well, that's when we really got worked up—it was obvious some creature was playing with us! We cranked up the psi-protection, tossed a gas grenade into every corner—and we're waiting to see who shows up, fingers on the triggers. We wait and wait... And the creature, as it turned out later, was a flier, or something... While we were down there playing the fool as a group, the bitch was sitting quietly under the ceiling and having a laugh... It only dawned on us late, and even then, almost by accident. The beast loosened a couple more beams—half the roof came down. Right on us... squashed four guys on the spot... That's when we got it! When Sanya heard a rustle up top, he just gave it a burst on reflex—a damn useful reflex, let me tell you! Man, the screeching! We all jumped, of course, and let it have it with every barrel we had... The thing tumbled down from above with screams that'd make your ears bleed. Well, then we really let loose: some were hitting it with buttstocks, others just kicking the life out of it. Sanya even pulled his knife to make sure its guts spilled out painfully... The commander had a hard time dragging everyone off, otherwise we'd have been scraping that filth off the floor with spoons...</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_1_name"><text>About the Beast in the Hangar</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_10"><text>Have you heard about the Guide? The very first stalker. First one who started going into the Zone. Still alive today. They say he can take you to any spot. The trouble is, finding him is problematic—he doesn't exactly post his address on flyers... And he doesn't agree to lead just anyone, either. Charges a pretty penny, but if you find him and strike a deal, rest assured, he'll get you where you need to go, guaranteed. Now that's someone worth talking to. He's probably seen what's actually behind the Radar...</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_10_name"><text>Superconductor</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_11"><text>Talking big and having the cash are two very different things... what, you thought money just falls into your lap here? No way! The only thing you get for free here is some freak eating you or soldiers gunning you down... You gotta think. You gotta think there, and think even harder here. Meatheads don't last long around here. It doesn't work if you're empty upstairs... Anyway, here's what happened. Me, Sinyak, and Tsepa, rest their souls, were walking through the utility yard, taking a shortcut. We see some bandit trekking along. Well, we hid. He passes right by us, doesn't notice a thing. Short guy, but he's hauling a bag that's heavy as hell. And his rifle's hanging in a clever way: one move and he'll pepper us with lead. So, Sinyak says to me: "Let's check this shrimp, see what he's got?" And I say: "Quiet, you woodpecker! Better watch where he's dragging his loot." Well... then the deer just vanished into thin air—we didn't even understand it. So, we wait. About twenty minutes later, he crawls out. While he's dusting himself off, Tsepa creeps up behind him and takes half his head off with a pistol. He and Sinyak started looting the body: he had some high-grade armor on him, and a fat wallet for sure... I stepped away to take a leak—my boys always give me my share, I'm always in on the cut. Then everything just blows the hell up!.. Turns out that chump wasn't so simple: he'd rigged something clever so it'd blow if someone tried to take his armor off. I got out of there fast—you never know who's gonna show up to the sound of shots and an explosion... I came back a month later. From Tsepa, Sinyak, and that deer—not even a bone left. Nothing. Anyway, I figured out where he’d dived into the ruins and went in myself... Well, I went through three rooms—empty! Then I see a pile of beds in the corner. Why the hell are there so many bunks? Anyway, I started clearing them. Cleared them out. And I see—mother of god—a hatch! I lift the lid, shine my flashlight. Holy mother of... I'm in paradise!.. Well, what was down there is my business... I didn't come away empty-handed. If I'd just sat around listening to stories, I'd have been a corpse long ago or still be running around barefoot, talking trash... like some people.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_11_name"><text>The Hatch to Paradise</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_12"><text>They say there's a certain group of fellows... sometimes they're called shamans, sometimes druids. They say they don't carry any electronic gear at all—claim to be "closer to nature" and all that... Well, they say the Zone reacts more strongly to electronics... to all kinds of electromagnetic radiation... yeah, and it sics monsters on you. According to them, the Zone is a living organism. You shouldn't poke at it with instruments, they say—a proper man can handle it without all the extra attachments. Though they still lug assault rifles around, the bastards... Why not try using teeth and claws then? On the other hand, it seems they don't die in the Zone that often. They don't kick the bucket any more than we do... So maybe they're onto something... They mostly enter the Zone from the Belarusian side, though... It'd be nice to catch a glimpse of them... and check how many artifacts they’ve got in their pockets while we're at it.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_12_name"><text>The Tale of the Combat Druids</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_13"><text>Anyone know about the classified labs deep in the Zone?.. They say they're still running... Yeah, right... It's a mystery how anyone could survive there at all... no supplies, no power... So the question arises: maybe it's not humans working there? I was talking to this one guy... He didn't see the labs himself... No, didn't see them, but his scanner picked up some weird transmissions at Yantar. They were talking about some lab. And another guy swore to the first one that he stumbled upon a figure in a suit—looked like a stalker's, but way more advanced... and this semi-transparent figure told him to get the hell out of there. "Don't interfere," it said, "leave, we're working here." Well, the guy nearly crapped himself... naturally! Who of us has seen anything like that before?.. Then again, it supposedly happened near the Radar... Right. So it's probably not true... But on the other hand... mutations come in all shapes and sizes, don't they? Maybe those aren't people anymore, but some kind of energy entities?..</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_13_name"><text>The Ghost's Shadow</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_14"><text>You know what I'll tell you? You almost can't sleep in this part of the Zone... I'm lucky, I can't fall asleep anyway... but people have such nightmares that sometimes they don't even wake up in the morning... heart failure, for example... Some kick the bucket, others just go completely insane... Recently, though, a rumor started that there's a fix. If you really need to sleep, you should find an old bucket... or at least a big pot... a washbasin or something... The main thing is it's gotta be intact... You stick your head in there—and you can sleep like a babe in the woods... Go ahead, laugh. I'll look at you in a couple of days when you're falling over from exhaustion. Wise guys... Tell me then, why the hell have the military been skulking around lately in those fancy helmets? Exactly! For about two years there was nothing, and lately they're everywhere! They've got some new helmets—the guys found a body and told us. There's a mesh inside made of thin copper wire attached to the liner. Think about it—what kind of harness is that, what's it for? Anyway, this "buzzing" isn't for nothing, I'm telling you. There aren't many anomalies to pick through here—not the best grounds, there are safer spots with fatter loot... I reckon they're marking the approaches. Preparing a bridgehead. They want to break through to the Sarcophagus, mark my words. Something's gonna blow soon and it'll hurt everyone. Mark my words... The main thing is to be far away from here when it happens.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_14_name"><text>Nightmare without a Bucket</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_15"><text>Listen, guys, do you know anything for real about the Interceptors? They say they're special ops, career military! But how they work, man! How they work! These aren't the morons you see at the checkpoints! Not only do they crawl into the deepest holes, they stay in the Zone for months! I'm not joking! They've got bases, several at once, tons of stashes, and the choppers drop supplies for them near the perimeter. Their commander is some guy named Gromov... I bet the name is fake. They call him "The Major" or "Thunder." You don't believe me?! Pakhomych caught an intercept once! Caught it and barely got away, or they would've popped him for nothing... Secrecy, dammit! Everyone knows Pakhomych, right? Well, there you go! It's not a joke, it's a serious team. God knows what they found so interesting here, but they work like crazy! I wish I had a third... no, ten percent of that! I'd have built a ten-story house in Sochi by now... They say they've got this gadget... detects monsters from two hundred meters away. Any beast! Obviously, you can just stroll through the Zone then... And they also say there are these other characters... Not military, more like our kind... Anyway, some of them made it to the center of the Zone. Not only did they make it, they say they can even tame the creatures! They never go past the perimeter to the Big Land—and no one goes to them either... well, except maybe those who are destined to reach the Sarcophagus... They've got so many artifacts they could use them for toilet paper! The Duty guys know all about them... they know, the bastards, they fight them and keep quiet! You ask one of those police types, and they all say: "Fairy tales." Aren't they total pricks?!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_15_name"><text>"Interceptors" - Inhabitants of the Deep</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_16"><text>Brothers, have you heard that several infidels recently approached the antennas? The Monolith guided us, and the brothers noticed them in time. One we destroyed immediately. The other two turned and ran. Cowards. They are all cowards. Only true faith leaves no room for fear! Two managed to escape, but the Monolith is wise and all-knowing. It means he needs them alive.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_16_name"><text>About those who broke through to the Antennas</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_17"><text>Brothers, the Monolith called to me last night. I spoke with Him. He was magnificent in His majesty. I was nearly blinded, but His light filled me with great power! I know, I feel that His strength dwells within all of us! He told me that only firm faith can defeat evil. He said that His power will fill only the faithful. He also revealed to me that our victory is already near!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_17_name"><text>About the Monolith in a Dream</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_18"><text>Brothers, recently the Monolith tested my faith, and I nearly strayed from the true path. But I stood firm! Praise the Monolith! His trials temper us! We were returning from the Dark Valley, and I fell slightly behind the brothers. Evil took advantage of this and suddenly began to play with me. And... I doubted. The true images became distorted; the enemy whispered to me that the Monolith uses us as slaves. But then I realized: it was a test. I remembered the might and radiance of the Monolith, and then my will and confidence returned to me. Since then, I no longer fear any trials and know no doubt. Praise the Monolith!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_18_name"><text>About the Trial of Faith</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_19"><text>I was in the Dark Valley. There are many infidels there, for the power of the Monolith has not yet reached those places. We were on guard. They attacked us at night. We fought those animals fiercely. The merits of the brothers were great: soon the Monolith called them to His side. For me, He prepared another trial. My weapon would no longer fire. But then the Monolith said to me: "You are with Me, and My power is with you. If you are firm in your faith, you will crush My enemies and draw closer to Me!" Then I became a shadow. I crouched and flanked them from the right. The foolish spies noticed nothing. They thought they had finished us and laughed over the empty bodies of our brothers. But I could already see their backs. And then, from my hands, the power of the Monolith struck. Thus He killed them all. I am happy to serve You, Perfect One!..</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_19_name"><text>About the Skirmish in the Dark Valley</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_2"><text>My partner and I had been eyeing a certain Research Institute for a long time. The place was just too deserted. No animals around, no mutants. But whoever went there came back either scared to death, completely insane, or wasn't seen ever again. We decided to scout it out quietly ourselves. We set out before dawn, and by the time we reached the place, it was starting to get light. We left the car in a small ravine and walked through the forest to the edge of the clearing. We stopped there; my partner stayed below, while I climbed a tree with optics to see what was happening in the vicinity. I see the buildings—and they weren't exactly abandoned; almost all the glass was intact, there wasn't much grass in the courtyards, not like in other places where it's waist-high... It looked like people lived there, but there was total silence, and no movement at all. Then suddenly, just to the right of me, some bursts rang out—someone was firing short rounds from an assault rifle. I looked through the optics. I see a stranger on the roof of one of the buildings, scurrying like a cornered rat, shooting indiscriminately in all directions. Who scared him so much—I looked and couldn't understand: he was alone there. And then... it started... I saw everything as if it were in the palm of my hand. The rifle flew out of his hands on its own... as if wings grew on the iron thing!.. The guy opened his mouth, apparently screamed something, pulled a knife, and held it in front of him. And then, god almighty, I see another one hanging in front of him on its own. Just hanging there in the air with the blade pointed at him, and no one is holding it. What happened next—is not a story for the nighttime... They spent five minutes cutting that man. Bit by bit, the bastards, damn them: a cut here, a stab there... The poor soul was soon covered in blood... Then, as his legs began to buckle, his knife was also knocked away; then the man was lifted into the air and spun around a couple of times... I've never seen anything like it in my life—honestly, it spun him like a rag... I was soaked in sweat in three seconds... Then... No, that's enough, I won't... Anyway, once I caught my breath, I spent another five minutes scanning the area with my scope. My hands were shaking, the optics were wet with sweat... Not a single damn creature! Both in the normal range and in infrared—no-thing. When I climbed down, my partner looked at me and decided not to ask. And when we got back to base, I spent a week drinking until I was blind, couldn't sober up... Later, when I recovered a bit, I asked our guys, maybe someone heard of such a thing? But people started looking at me sideways, wondering if I'd lost my mind? So that's how it is...</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_2_name"><text>Horror at the Research Institute</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_20"><text>Brothers, we were patrolling the edges of the Black Forest and stumbled upon a lone infidel there. He began to transform, so we did not kill him, but he was still half-stuck in his animal state... I know, the wise Monolith did this for all of us: He showed us the true face of His enemies again. Now our faith is even stronger! It is near, brothers!.. Victory over the infidels is near, and then the Monolith will fulfill our deepest desire! He will bring the truly devoted close to Him, to His glory, to His majesty! We shall dwell forever in His radiance!..</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_20_name"><text>Transformation in the Black Forest</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_3"><text>Anyway, a friend of mine told me this. His bosses woke him up in the middle of the night: "Hurry to the lab! A shipment arrived." He’s half-asleep and doesn't get it: what shipment? They tell him: "Did you drink too much government alcohol? There's a fresh corpse on the table, dinner is served!" He goes to the table. And there's this... He's seen his fair share of corpses from the Zone in his time: torn ones, fried-and-boiled ones, and dozens of mutants, but this time his dinner started doing backflips in his stomach. At first glance, almost a human, except the head doesn't look like a normal one at all: a huge pumpkin, all bumpy. And the body—like a concentration camp, damn. Skin and bones. But he figured that out later; at first, he says, I look and see some kind of mess: everything's inside out, smeared with orange-red gunk, like blood... Those bastards didn't spare any ammo. It was, he says, a cross between a colander and a torn hot-water bottle... And they clearly walked all over him in their heavy boots; not an object, but a hunk of meat in black rags. Anyway, he slaved away for the rest of the night and half the morning. It turns out this is that very creature that the locals know as the illusionist: black rags, stalkers seeing visions, a head a meter in circumference... The funny thing is that whoever saw its face thought it was, like, the crown of its head. No, it actually has a face, just a very tiny one: the blinkers don't open, and the nose is like a pin, though the mouth is huge, like a gateway. Apparently, it walks with its head hanging on its chest—doesn't have the strength to keep it straight... A real egghead... And imagine what these creatures eat for dinner. Mushrooms! Little mushrooms! Anyway, everyone's seen it—the Zone is full of mushrooms, and the "old-timers" swear that these creatures squeeze the juice out of them. Gourmets, damn... And do you know what was hidden in his little pouch on his side? Well? As if you'd know! Anyway, he had dried brains in there. And do you know whose? A controller's!..</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_3_name"><text>The Pathologist's Dinner</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_4"><text>Some dummy joined us on a trek deep into the Zone... We're moving, right, we stop for five minutes to rest, and he immediately sits on his backside and relaxes. And when it's time to go, he's the last to get his butt off the ground. Well, he relaxed a bit too much... He fell behind, and a controller snatched him by the brain—and that was it... So, remember the moral of the story. A rustle there or a suspicious breeze... Even if a bunny runs past, though God forbid there are bunnies here... In short, you have to be ready every second. Keep your magazines and grenades close and your rifle on full auto. If you see something, dump half a mag immediately. If there's something behind the bushes—blast that too, and ask questions later. The basic training here is this: they won't give you extra duties, they'll eat your guts out before you can even fart! Yeah, about controllers, that's a separate story. Suppose you've fired at a rustle; drop to the ground immediately, that very second! On your back, however. A controller hooks you if he sees you; he needs to concentrate, or something. While you're sunbathing in the shade, keep both ears open—listen for rustling or any filth coming your way. You can quietly click the bolt, and it wouldn't hurt to prep grenades too... Anyway, if it's all quiet, count to three and run! Run as far away as possible! Well, did you get it? Sigh... Protect yourself every second—that's the only way to survive here...</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_4_name"><text>A Controller's Easy Prey</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_5"><text>What I'm thinking is... Not even what I'm thinking—just wondering... What if everything—everything that's here—is some kind of experiment on people? Maybe it's some little green men... Why not? It's as good a theory as any... I'm curious: if this is something like a testing ground, what exactly are they testing here? Checking which artifacts make us drool the most? Or are they all just bombs, huh? People have dragged them all over the world, to all sorts of labs; rich folks have shelled out for them... No, well, that's great!.. I'd love to see that!.. They bought some junk under the table... paid a pile of cash... Like "ours is the coolest," be jealous, you sheep... and it... it... goes BOOM!.. Oh, brilliant!.. Oh, I can't!.. Oh... whew... But really, of course, who knows what's actually going on... Maybe someone who's been past the Radar can tell us about it... Well, yeah, maybe they know, but they can't speak—they just grunt and drool. Maybe that's exactly why they drool... Sigh... That's how all these thoughts creep in... It's not fun at all...</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_5_name"><text>Hidden Pitfalls</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_6"><text>Right... I remember someone asking me about something yesterday, but I forgot... Oh, I remember. So, there are curious folks wondering why only our eggheads are poking around in the Zone, and foreigners don't show their faces, even though there's enough material here for three thousand Nobels... So, I'll answer point by point. First of all, why bother coming here themselves when they can give ours a grant with such conditions that they'll bring you everything you need on a silver platter themselves? And secondly, they actually have been here, and in large numbers. It's only in the last two years that the outsiders have been afraid to crawl into the Zone... they had one major disaster. Now they only buy materials and information. They pay pretty well overall, so a lot of loners work for them, and marauders too... What, haven't you heard this story? You're kidding! The whole Zone was buzzing about it, and you're acting like you just dropped from the sky. Anyway, it was a big deployment. About thirty scientists from half the world... all the top minds, obviously, this and that... They prepared seriously: they poured in so much money they didn't know what to do with it, mountains of equipment. They took a squad of military specialists for protection, three of our guides, loaded into shielded armored personnel carriers, and set off. What happened? They came back a week later... twelve people in a completely trashed APC. They reached the wire near the Rotten Forest, and there they were already being waited for... by marauders. Yeah... Those guys don't care where people escaped from... They laid almost everyone out. Only three made it past the perimeter—two of ours and one egghead. The guy's mind was completely blown from the experience... Well, they quickly grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and sent him for treatment. He's writing a book about the Zone now. Our guys were okay—experience helped. Though... they probably lost their minds in their own way too: one went to the Radar and vanished, and the second headed for the Big Land. As for the rest, the Zone took them. Heard of Town-32? That's where they got caught. At first, everything seemed quiet... well, within limits... They were filming, measuring, collecting samples, poking anomalies with instruments... And then the madness began. Massive. People started slowly losing their minds. Our guy, the one who retired, told me: "Some started tearing their throats out with their fingernails, some smashed their heads against the wall, and some just shoved their gun in the mouth, and... And then the animals came. Those who were still sane barricaded themselves in a house." Can you imagine it? Outside it's night and all the local beasts are prowling, and inside people are losing their marbles one after another. In short, by morning, those who could still think somehow escaped. They drove back straight through, off-road; even hit a couple of anomalies... Reached the Rotten Forest... And as for those who stayed behind, no one was ever found. The guys just say that the number of controllers in those parts increased sharply. Yeah... Since then, no one pokes their nose into Town-32, and you can't lure a foreigner into the Zone with any treat...</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_6_name"><text>Chronicles of the Egghead Globalists</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_7"><text>So, here's what I wanted to say. When the Duty guys were taking that illusionist, I was right there! I just happened to be in those parts by accident! My car's front right went: the bolts sheared off on a bump. And I had zero spare parts. I cursed as much as I could, and then I thought, I'll go to the factory and pick up what I need. Well, it was a kilometer's walk, back and forth—thirty minutes of work! And I'd been there before... Suddenly I see "Duty"! And not just a patrol, but about fifty of them! Well, I thought, bloody hell!.. I just dropped into the bushes right where I stood. "If they noticed me and start searching," I thought, "it's over for me." I lay down in a hollow and tried not to breathe. And then the shooting! I've only heard such long bursts once in my life... when they took the First Base—old timers, remember? Anyway, I'm lying there, listening with both ears... It's banging away, and then, boom!.. After five minutes it dies down, and no one seems to be coming my way. Well, I got bold, stood up a bit and looked through my binoculars. And they're quickly pulling out of the workshop... all beat up, dragging a bunch of their corpses behind them and the illusionist on a tarp... only scraps were left of the illusionist... They pulled away into a hollow. Then I hear the engines roar and the sound faded. I waited a bit more—seemed like no one was there. I went inside. Well, obviously, after Duty, you won't find a damn thing! But it was interesting! It was, I tell you, something else! They'd shot almost all the way through the walls. Beams were lying across the floor, a piece of the roof had collapsed. Shell casings up to your knees—a literal shooting range. Blood, scraps of something... I didn't find anything useful though, just two full magazines and a rifle lying there, pinned by a beam, couldn't pull it out... I completely forgot about the bolts, obviously... Returned to the car, thought for five minutes, took a bolt from each of the other wheels... and drove back slowly... But if I'd stepped out there thirty minutes earlier... Yeah...</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_7_name"><text>Duty's Illusion</text></string>
<string id="stalker_story_8"><text>Yeah, so back then I made it all the way to the outskirts of Pripyat. And I decided to look around first. Found a high point—there was a large boiler room there with a chimney. Well, I went in carefully... everything looked fine—dust on the floor, no tracks... I crawled into the furnace and started climbing: there were steps inside the chimney. I was climbing fine, the soot wasn't even rubbing off anymore—it had turned to stone... I poked my head out carefully... Beautiful! Half the city was in the palm of my hand! I pulled out my binoculars and started looking around... (short pause) And then... I was already about to crawl back down, and then a thought flashed: I hadn't even looked at what was happening right under my nose! I leaned over the edge a bit, looked one way, then the other... Oh boy! I almost walked into it! A dwarf was strolling through the inner courtyard! The main thing is, I was already almost halfway down! It's a good thing he hadn't seen me yet. But I couldn't take his head off: my AKS was on my back, and the chimney was too narrow to turn around. With the PM under my arm, it was a lost cause, it was about fifty meters, plus the height difference... basically, if I didn't shoot him immediately, and I wouldn't, then I'd be dead. I sat there, thinking. And I watched what he was doing at the same time. And he was doing something strange. At first, he was digging through a pile of junk with a lot of energy, pieces were flying left and right. And then suddenly, he just froze right where he stood. Seemed like he was listening. And then total chaos started. The trash in that pile started moving on its own. The dwarf jumped back quickly, stood up straight, put his hands to his head, twisted his palms in some clever way... and then stuff started flying at him! From all sides!.. Iron pieces, bricks, roofing felt, branches... He was covered up to his head. Well, I thought, that's it. The kitten's finished, he won't be peeing anymore... No way! That junk lay there for two seconds, and then it sprayed out in all directions just like that! There were pipe scraps there, and they stuck right into the concrete fence. The dwarf stood there for another half-minute, thought about something, then turned around and stomped into the building. I spent a minute catching my breath. "Well," I thought, "enough is enough, time to get out of here." And then suddenly, the smell of smoke drifted up. And then it started getting hot. Go to hell! Someone started a fire down below! A minute later, I couldn't breathe. I somehow scrambled to the edge of the chimney; there was no platform there, so I sat with my legs dangling... But the smoke was still stinging my eyes, not enough air... basically, I had to leave immediately! Thank God I always carried forty meters of cord with me just in case of fire... literally, a fire... Anyway, I folded it in half—it wasn't very thick—somehow secured it on the chimney, tore my neckerchief in two, wrapped it over my fingerless gloves, and started climbing down, praying to all the gods... Only one thought in my head: just don't slip! No harness, nothing, the cord cutting into my palms... And of course, by the law of maximum irony, it was about five meters short of the ground. I had to jump. What else could I do? Oh, I hit the ground hard! I was lucky I didn't break anything... But I got scraped up and pulled my right leg—hard! Later I thought I'd torn the ligaments. But back then I bolted out of there so fast I probably would've won a gold medal in sprinting...</text></string>

<string id="stalker_story_9"><text>Back then, I didn't believe my eyes. You'd think there are beautiful girls, right? But this one was... she was... Perfection. Yes. There. Perfection. It felt as if the world around her was black-and-white and blurry, and she alone was in color and sharp focus. How she moved! I'd never seen anything like that before, either. I had a lump in my throat. Why did she need this science! What was she doing here, in the Zone?.. Well, yeah, in the Zone. It was toward evening... Near the bus station, there’s a separate nine-story building. First, something flashed in the window on the ground floor. I quickly flicked the safety off my rifle and then I see—she comes out of the entrance... I wanted to rub my eyes—who knows what to expect from the Zone? But she approaches. And I'm standing like an idiot, staring... I keep my rifle ready, though—habit... Then she noticed me... She smiled... Said hello... And I was listening but not hearing, just looking at her. She was in a blue coverall, very bright... But not baggy, almost form-fitting... Her figure was something fantastic! Then it finally hit me that I wasn't listening at all to what she was saying, just standing there grinning from ear to ear... Turns out she was from a research group. She asked if I could help her. Her! I would've crawled into an anomaly for her!.. She said she was studying those, what do you call them... Zone endemics. Plants that are only found here. She said she ran away from the guards because there's no freedom of action with them, and she came here alone. I don't know. I believed her. I agreed to help bring her something. Two days later I came back, as we agreed. I almost died five times while I was collecting it. I'm walking, and there’s only one thought in my head: I'm about to see her again! And nothing! I didn't even see the house where I met her. Just like that... But man, what she was like! She was practically glowing from the inside...</text></string>

<string id="Stories"><text>Local Folklore</text></string>

<string id="story1_text_0"><text>Why the long face?</text></string>
<string id="story1_text_1"><text>Listen, I'll tell you a story. A stalker told me not long ago what happened to him. \nHe found a cigarette case once and brought it to Sidorovich. Sidorovich turned it over in his hands and said it was junk, total trash... But there was something scratched on the back, some names. Sidorovich took a magnifying glass and barely managed to make out the names Timokha, Sokhaty, and one more, I forget. But Sidorovich said he doesn't collect tin cans, so he didn't need the scrap. He only mentioned that this Timokha guy shows up in his ledger as a debtor, but he didn't know the others.</text></string>
<string id="story1_text_2"><text>So what? Big deal... quite a story.</text></string>
<string id="story1_text_22"><text>I'm not interested, I know the rest.</text></string>
<string id="story1_text_3"><text>Hang on, I haven't finished yet. Well, the stalker took the case back—you know how it is, cigarettes always get crushed, and a metal case is handy. Later, he asked around a campfire if anyone knew who this Timokha and the others were, and showed the case... And someone, Seriy I think, says he'd seen that case with a stalker named Sasha, nicknamed "Lucky." Turns out he used to hang around the Garbage, but then he got cocky, said he wasn't going to dig through trash anymore and that he’d soon have a mountain of loot... then he took off somewhere. \nOh, and about Timokha... One day that Timokha comes to Seriy and starts asking all about Lucky—what, where, and which way. He had two thugs with him who looked more like bandits than diggers; they kept quiet but were scanning everything, looking for someone. Seriy told them Lucky probably headed for the Bar. And that was it, those three left and weren't seen again. \nWell... the stalker who found the case got curious and decided to check things out at the Bar when he had the chance. And imagine this! He meets a guy there. That guy tells him he had a friend, a great man. And he happened to stumble upon an artifact field. What luck! He took what he could, of course, but you can't carry it all. And there were some rare pieces there. One evening he was offloading his loot—you know how it goes: stalkers shuffle in front of the trader, saying aloud that they only have junk, nothing interesting, while quietly sliding the loot over so no one else sees. But either his bag had a hole or he just got sloppy, because someone spotted what else he had in his backpack.</text></string>
<string id="story1_text_4"><text>And then what?</text></string>
<string id="story1_text_5"><text>The obvious happened. This isn't a finishing school for young ladies... Anyway, the man found his friend too late. He was in bad shape... He only managed to say that they caught him, took all his loot, and threw him in a pit to force him to lead those scumbags back to where he found the treasure. But he wouldn't budge, so they beat him, and beat him hard. While he was sitting in that pit, he scratched the names of the ones he remembered from their conversations onto the cigarette case... And then he died. \nThe most interesting part is that the cigarette case had actually been given to him by that very man in the Bar. But they’d taken the case and all his gear.</text></string>
<string id="story1_text_6"><text>A sad ending.</text></string>
<string id="story1_text_7"><text>That’s not the end yet. The end went like this. The man the stalker met in the Bar said he spent two months tracking those ghouls, but he eventually found them all... one by one. In short, he settled the score for Lucky Sasha with every last one of them. But they didn't have the cigarette case on them—drank the proceeds away, probably, the bastards. And it was important to him as a memory of his friend, well... you understand, there was nothing else left. \nAnd then, the stalker says: "Well, here’s your cigarette case right here, I found it by accident! Take it, man, and remember your friend!" The guy practically teared up. Just like that... So the end of the story isn't actually that sad.</text></string>
<string id="story1_text_8"><text>Yeah... it's amazing how things turn out.</text></string>

<string id="story2_text_0"><text>What are you thinking about? Looking like you just remembered something...</text></string>
<string id="story2_text_1"><text>I'll tell you a story I heard recently. So, a stalker found this... thing. You know, a little wooden figurine, carved and polished... what do you call it... I forgot, there's a scientific name for it... Anyway, that's not the point. People find all sorts of stuff in the Zone—junk and useful gear alike—but he'd never seen anything like this. It was like... a... either a controller or a bloodsucker. And it was carved so skillfully, out of some strange wood—black and polished to a shine.</text></string>
<string id="story2_text_2"><text>So what... someone was bored out of their mind waiting out a blowout and carved it with a knife.</text></string>
<string id="story2_text_22"><text>You've told this one already. I'm not interested in hearing it twice.</text></string>
<string id="story2_text_3"><text>No, you don't just carve something like that out of boredom. Someone really put effort into it; he said it was master craftsmanship. And at the bottom, there were two zeros, or maybe the letters "OO", like a brand, you get me? Anyway, never mind that, listen to the rest... He figured he'd sell it to a trader; there are collectors who buy up all sorts of Zone-related curiosities, so he’d let the trader flip it to them. He headed for the Bar... but he'd found the figure in the Dark Valley. On the way, he stopped to rest by a fire at the Garbage. Over a bottle, he showed it around, and one guy says to him: "I've seen that mark before. It's not a brand, it's Pashka Ochkarik's signature. He puts his 'facsimile' on everything so people know it's his. Writes it on every little thing, his flask, his pistol, even sewed a tag like that onto his backpack... he’s a rookie and a bit of a weirdo. Wanted to prove to everyone he was worth something, wanted to gain some street cred among the stalkers, but he's just a zit on a donkey's ass, an egghead... And they told him Ochkarik had headed for the Bar.</text></string>
<string id="story2_text_4"><text>And now you're going to say that, of course, he met him at the Bar?</text></string>
<string id="story2_text_5"><text>I am, so don't laugh... If he hadn't met him, that four-eyes wouldn't have been laughing for long. You won't believe what he’d cooked up... Back then, there was a proper Arena, they held serious fights before Duty shut down those "Ancient Roman" amusements. This Ochkarik wanted to find fame on the Arena, publicly, so to speak, so his name would ring out across the whole Zone... Idiot didn't even know which side of a Kalash the bolt was on.\nAnyway, here's what I'm getting at... So the stalker sees this kid sitting in the bar, a total egghead, four-eyes, just boozing. He goes up to him: "You Pashka Ochkarik?" "Well... yeah." "What are you doing here?" The kid told him about his plan. Only, he was terrified of actually stepping into the Arena, couldn't bring himself to do it... That's why the stalker found him still alive—in the Zone, sometimes the guy who pisses himself at the right moment ends up living longer than the brave ones.</text></string>
<string id="story2_text_6"><text>I still don't get the point of all this...</text></string>
<string id="story2_text_7"><text>The point is that the figurine really was Ochkarik's. It was his talisman, see? A boxer friend gave it to him. That friend had never lost a single fight, not once. He gave him this figurine carved from a special rosewood. He told him that if he rubbed it before every fight, that's it, victory was in the bag. He was just joking, I reckon. But this Ochkarik believed it and lost his talisman somewhere. Got spooked by dogs, started running, and it fell out. Because, you see, "he forgot to rub it"... He figured if he’d had the talisman on him, he would’ve felt much bolder and gone into the Arena.\nIsn't he a moron? Tell me. The stalker gave him the talisman back, he felt sorry for the kid, but told him this: "You can rub this thing as much as you want, rub it on your backside for all I care, but only if you promise you won't test your confidence in the Arena! Get the hell out of here, and if I see you anywhere near the Arena!.." Long story short, the kid got the message. And it worked... seemed to set his head straight. Met him later at the Garbage. Just a simple way of helping a person out.</text></string>
<string id="story2_text_8"><text>Yeah, he got lucky, I guess. There sure are some strange ones...</text></string>

<string id="story3_text_0"><text>What are you laughing at? Care to share?</text></string>
<string id="story3_text_1"><text>Have you heard the story about the cultist priest? So... this priest appeared in the Zone. Not Diodor, everyone knows him, but another one... and not really a priest at all, just a weirdo, a cultist in short. And he had some kind of epiphany in the Zone, met HIM... God knows who, but he believed in Him so much he nearly lost his mind.</text></string>
<string id="story3_text_2"><text>How do you know? Did he tell you himself or something?</text></string>
<string id="story3_text_22"><text>Ah... I've heard this one, you don't need to continue.</text></string>
<string id="story3_text_3"><text>I never met him, I was told... But you wanted to hear something interesting, so listen and don't interrupt. Anyway. When he came out of his "vision" for a bit, or maybe just woke up from a haze, who knows... he saw that he was holding an icon. Or rather, what do you call it... a panagia... there, I remembered the word. It's a little icon with stones around the edges, in gold and diamonds, usually. But his was simple, just a painting on wood: a controller in the center, and zombies on the sides, six on the left and six on the right. How do I know the details... I met an artist here, he's the one who told me. He said he was the one who painted it. He paints all sorts of things; I've even seen his drawings with other people, a Zone avant-gardist... Only he hasn't been seen for a while, vanished somewhere, and I wanted to commission something from him...</text></string>
<string id="story3_text_4"><text>Don't get distracted, you started talking about the priest.</text></string>
<string id="story3_text_5"><text>Right, so the artist and I got to talking, and he mentioned the priest. He met him somewhere in an empty trailer. The guy was barely clinging to life, starving to death. So the artist, being a kind soul, offered him some food, but the little priest wouldn't take it and said: "I don't need food. I am meditating and fasting. You all scurry about, looking for something, never knowing peace. And you don't understand that it's all vanity of vanities, and there is only Him." "Who's Him?" the artist asks. "The High Controller and his 12 apostles appeared to me and left me this panagia so I would not forget Him, but pray to His glory. But I have sinned, for I did not protect His gift. And now I will fast until He appears again and forgives me."</text></string>
<string id="story3_text_6"><text>Damn... sounds like the guy got hit hard by a controller's gaze or just smoked too much weed...</text></string>
<string id="story3_text_7"><text>Exactly, probably the latter, because the artist said there was a very specific smell in there. The artist sees that the old man is about to kick the bucket from hunger, but he won't touch the food. So he says: "What kind of faith in a controller is this that you have to torture yourself like this? Drop it, I saw him... he's out there sunbathing in a hollow already, said with his last breath that he forgives you..." But the priest wouldn't have it: "You're talking nonsense. And I won't enter into such a discussion with you right now. You must be new to the Zone and haven't understood anything yet. Live here long enough and you'll have questions for which you'll seek answers but find them nowhere." Fine, the artist replies: "Is a controller going to answer all your questions then? I've seen all kinds of preachers here. If you've decided to promote your faith, why sit here? Go to the masses, spread the 'good and eternal,' or you'll just rot away here." And the priest tells him: "Your questions haven't ripened yet. We'll talk later, if you survive... But here I fast and pray, for I have lost His precious gift." \nMan, what a lost cause... or so the artist thought. He said: "And if HE sends me to search for your panagia and I find it, will you heed His words?" "Yes..." So the artist had to urgently paint a controller and 12 little zombies. Found a piece of wood, had his paints with him, he does sketches of the Zone, after all. Found a bottle, broke it, stuck bits of glass around the edges... anyway, the thing turned out great, could've put it in an exhibition, he's got real talent, I've seen his work... He went back and said: "Here, father... HE himself gave me your panagia, and a couple of cans of stew to boot. Said you're already at death's door from fasting. You can go preach, He gave permission. Oh... and He added that you should go to the people, maybe you'll recover there." I don't know what happened to the artist, like I told you, but someone met that priest later near the Rostok area.</text></string>
<string id="story3_text_8"><text>What can you say... everyone comes to the Zone for their own reasons, but in the end, no one survives alone.</text></string>

<string id="story4_text_0"><text>So, how's the Zone treating you?</text></string>
<string id="story4_text_1"><text>It varies. Sometimes she hits you so hard sparks fly from your eyes, and other times she gifts you like a king. There was this one time... Interested?</text></string>
<string id="story4_text_2"><text>Go on, tell me. I'm listening.</text></string>
<string id="story4_text_22"><text>Nah, people say all kinds of things... Better just have a drink.</text></string>
<string id="story4_text_3"><text>Hmm... Me and "Kostya Machinegun" were hired by the eggheads to check on a brew. \nWe geared up at the Bar, reached the Warehouses, everything was going smooth. Found a Vortex, Kostya used ropes to pull everything needed into it, we sat in a nearby shack, made a fire, the whole bit—just waiting!\nAn hour later, we went out to see if it was ready. I see our beauty jumping and shimmering near the Vortex. I covered it with a container, slid a board under it, and flipped it so I wouldn't have to touch it. Well, we were so happy we decided to celebrate with some vodka right there in the shack.\nVodka's flowing, feeling good...\nIt got dark already.\nI lift my head, and through the window, two eyes are looking at me, huge ones. Holy mother of god, a Chimera! My partner saw it too; he jerked his rifle up and let out a burst at those eyes.\nDidn't hit it, apparently.\nHe jumped up and bolted for the exit, screaming something. I propped myself up and saw her shake him like a rag doll.\nLegs one way, body the other.\nI just froze, like I was paralyzed. I could only see Kostya looking at me, opening his mouth and wheezing...</text></string>
<string id="story4_text_4"><text>Damn, that's grim. What about you?</text></string>
<string id="story4_text_5"><text>What about me... The Chimera sat down, rubbed its snout against the tiles, and just stayed there. I backed away, but I tripped over something and fell. I look down, and there's nothing there. I shined my flashlight and saw that the floor was flat. But there was definitely something there. And then some sparking started, like a match being struck at my feet. I didn't believe my eyes. An artifact, maybe? But invisible? Can't be! What a situation: death is right there, my friend just got torn apart, and I'm thinking about what I tripped over. I reach out to the spot where it sparked, and just then the Chimera's claws scraped against the wall. I felt that sound with my whole skin, made my teeth ache. The veil lifted from me, I jumped up—and went head-first through the opposite window. I ran without looking back, clutching the container to my chest. Now I'm thinking about going back there to find that invisible thing. But no, I can't yet. I just can't...</text></string>
<string id="story4_text_6"><text>Where, where did it happen? Maybe I'll go and take a look?</text></string>
<string id="story4_text_7"><text>You'll take a look?\n...\nI'll search it myself once I've recovered. That thing must be valuable. So... keep that in mind...</text></string>
<string id="story4_text_8"><text>Well, suit yourself.</text></string>

<string id="story5_text_0"><text>Why the long face? Tell us a story or something...</text></string>
<string id="story5_text_1"><text>Gloomy? Nah, I’m just always like this. But as for stories... Uh... You ever hear about artifact sets?</text></string>
<string id="story5_text_2"><text>Go on, I'm listening.</text></string>
<string id="story5_text_22"><text>Heard it, heard it. Forget it, relax.</text></string>
<string id="story5_text_3"><text>I had a strange experience, even though I've been in the Zone a long time and not much surprises me anymore. I got hired to deliver some artifacts to an egghead at the Swamps. The artifacts were all emeralds, a Wrenched, a Stone Blood, and a Jellyfish. Beautiful bastards, protection against impact and rupture is great, they're just a bit heavy. The reward he promised was pretty good, honestly. It was on my way, so I agreed. Decided to rush through Agroprom. Everything was going fine, but then I decided to take a shortcut over the hill near the military base, and ran into a pack of blind dogs and a pseudo-dog. I climbed onto a concrete foundation, they knocked the rifle out of my hands, I pulled my pistol and dropped four of them, but then I ran out of ammo. Well, I thought, I need to climb down and grab my shotgun, but to keep from getting torn apart while I’m fumbling around, I'll activate the arts. I put on all three emeralds, turned on the belt... Something flashed, dust, and then darkness...</text></string>
<string id="story5_text_4"><text>Hm? And then what? How'd that happen?</text></string>
<string id="story5_text_5"><text>Listen, don't interrupt.\nI turned on my flashlight and lost it: I'm in the Agroprom underground... How? What happened? Well, I slowly made my way to the exit, found a soldier's corpse, picked up a Kalash and about ten rounds... Anyway, I got outside, reached the guys at the complex, looked, and the arts weren't on my belt! Drank half a liter, mourned, slept it off, and went into the lab to look for them. Ran into a bloodsucker, killed it by a miracle, but never found the artifacts. I Went to the Barkeep after that. I tell him the story, and he just cusses me out, doesn't believe a word. Says I probably drank the money away or they got stolen while I slept. Basically, my loot went up in smoke, and Barkeep is still sore about it. Only, I heard later that three Emeralds on a belt is a set, and it somehow affects teleportation. But you're not exactly going to collect a set like that just to try it out in front of witnesses. It might drop you into some hellhole you can't crawl out of...</text></string>
<string id="story5_text_6"><text>I don't really believe it. Sounds like a bunch of bull, doesn't it?</text></string>
<string id="story5_text_7"><text>Bull? Have it your way... When it happens to you, then you'll believe it.</text></string>
<string id="story5_text_8"><text>We'll see...</text></string>

<string id="story6_text_0"><text>Why so gloomy? Tell us a story or something...</text></string>
<string id="story6_text_1"><text>Gloomy? Nah, I’m just always like this. But as for stories... Uh... You ever hear about artifact sets?</text></string>
<string id="story6_text_2"><text>Go on, I'm listening.</text></string>
<string id="story6_text_22"><text>Heard it, heard it. Forget it, relax.</text></string>
<string id="story6_text_3"><text>Me and Gena Brigadier were crossing the Wild Territory. Suddenly, bandits show up. We were coming from Yantar, from Sakharov, and we’d offloaded a ton of loot. Well, we figured we wouldn't go down without a fight. We traded lead, as usual; lucky for us, Genka brought grenades, that’s what saved the day. We fought them off. We moved on, but wouldn't you know it, one of those punks survived. He waited until our backs were turned and unloaded his gun right into Genka's back. The suit was tough, but what's the point? A Point-blank from a shotgun, there’s just no chance he would live. I didn't miss my turn, though; emptied a whole AK mag into the bastard. I ran to Genka, but he was already breathing his last. Man, I thought, my brother’s done for, how can this be? Then I remembered we hadn't turned in the Soul, Stone Blood, and Meat Chunk artifacts to Sakharov, thinking we might need them ourselves. Talk about a jinx. I cracked the container open right then and there, stuffed them into Genka's belt, and hooked up the battery, thinking we’d make it to the Bar. The arts started working; I saw color coming back to Genka's face, and I felt relieved. But I celebrated too soon. A blowout hit out of nowhere! What kind of rotten luck is this, I thought. I threw Genka over my shoulder and dragged the loot across the ground...</text></string>
<string id="story6_text_4"><text>Well? What happened next?</text></string>
<string id="story6_text_5"><text>Listen, don't interrupt.\nIt was heavy! Ammo, rifles, a couple of containers each. Couldn't just leave it. I realized I wasn't going to make it; the peak of the blowout was coming, my head was spinning, I started feeling sick, but I kept dragging Genka, if we’re dying, we’re dying together, brother! I crawled into the hangar and collapsed inside, losing consciousness...\n...\nI don't remember how long I was out, but when I opened my eyes, Genka was sitting right next to me warming up some canned food. He just smiled, like, "enough sleeping, wake up already." I couldn't even say a word. How? He was dying, and here he is heating up food for me. We talked for a long time after that. Turns out those arts I put on Genka completely "rotted" during the blowout; they lost all their beneficial properties, it must have been a really powerful surge.\nBut as Genka said, at the moment of the blowout, something happened to them, some kind of flash, and his strength just started surging right before his eyes. The bleeding stopped, the pain vanished...\nAnd so, my brother came back to life...\nOnly trouble is, those artifacts disappeared completely—nothing left to turn in. But it makes me think, maybe that was one of those "sets" the veteran stalkers are always whispering about.</text></string>
<string id="story6_text_6"><text>Were the artifacts special in some way, or just regular ones?</text></string>
<string id="story6_text_7"><text>Who the hell knows. We didn't pay attention at first, and afterwards, there was no way to tell.</text></string>
<string id="story6_text_8"><text>Damn... the Zone...</text></string>
