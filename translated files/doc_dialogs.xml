<string id="tex_mikhalych_item"><text>\nMikhalych asked me to find some lost devices. Landmark — an old column of military vehicles, somewhere in the eastern part of the Tesla Zone.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_start_0"><text>Why are you squinting like that, wanted something?</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_start_1"><text>I've got a proposal for you. There's a small problem. If you help us—well, me specifically—solve it, I'll be able to reward you properly.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_start_2"><text>What kind of problem? And I'd also like to know right away what "properly reward" actually means.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_start_3"><text>A certain Professor Sakharov came to me—the one at Yantar, sitting there in his tin can. The thing is, two rather valuable devices were lost in that damned Tesla Zone.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_start_4"><text>Got it… And about the second question?</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_start_5"><text>Alright, listen up. You already know that artifacts have different properties. Some are a bit better, some a bit worse. Take a "Medusa" for example—there's one that pumps out radiation like crazy, but helps against telepathy and other nasty stuff, and then there's another that radiates like hell and doesn't protect from anything at all. Still, a "Medusa" is a "Medusa" anywhere you go. Beyond the Border they won't really care whether it irradiates or not. It's here, in the Zone, that it matters for a regular stalker—you'd rather it protect your ass without frying you with radiation.\nThat's where the business comes in: if you want a better artifact, you come to me, give me two slightly worse ones, and I give you one—but a better one. So, are you in?</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_start_61"><text>Uh-huh… So I bring you two good artifacts, and you give me one excellent one? Got it… If I agree, where do I look for Sakharov's devices? Tesla isn't the kind of place where you can wander around all day, poking under every bush.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_start_62"><text>No, I'll manage without it.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_start_71"><text>Sharp kid. Got it right away… They were lost somewhere in Sector Twenty-Three. A rough landmark is a column of military vehicles in the eastern part of Tesla. The devices aren't very heavy—about five kilos each. I've already talked to a few stalkers about this problem, but it seems to me that you've got, how should I put it… a sense of responsibility.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_start_72"><text>Your loss, but that's your choice.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_start_8"><text>I'll try to look for them, but no promises.</text></string>

<string id="mikhalych_item_done_0"><text>Mikhalych, I found those damn "devices".</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_done_1"><text>Well I'll be damned, you made it back. I thought you were done for already… They don't irradiate, do they? That's the last thing we need.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_done_2"><text>No, doesn't look like it. These "devices" look more like containers. Maybe there's something valuable inside?</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_done_3"><text>Containers or not, what's it to you? Whether there's something inside or not—that's for Sakharov to figure out. Our job was just to find them. Got it?</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_done_4"><text>Alright then, take them. Let them sort it out themselves.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_done_5"><text>Yeah, seems they're not irradiating. Interesting, really interesting… What were they trying to haul out of Tesla that they sent a whole army column in there?</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_done_6"><text>So they really are containers?!</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_done_7"><text>That's none of your concern. Here's your reward for running around, and you can start collecting artifacts. Bring them to me, I'll trade.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_item_done_8"><text>Not exactly generous… You can tell right away whose godfather you've got.</text></string>
<!-- sidor_outfit -->
<string id="tex_sidor_outfit"><text>\nSidorovich asked me to find out about Duty's supply routes. In return, he promised a good suit with a mask. Need to go to the Bar and talk to Plichko.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_0"><text>Sidorovich, I've got urgent business.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_1"><text>Where you running to? The Zone isn't a stadium. Out here you walk, watch your step, and keep your head on a swivel.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_2"><text>No time for jokes… I need a suit, with a gas mask—better yet, a full mask. Got to head down into some catacombs, and the gas down there is brutal.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_31"><text>Decided to play at being a digger? Didn't happen to hire yourself out as Mole's assistant, did you?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_32"><text>Don't have one. Ask around at the Bar, or go talk to the military at Agroprom.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_4"><text>I need to check something in the underground tunnels at Agroprom. Supposedly Strelok had a base there. Maybe something's still left… maybe I'll find something, remember something.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_5"><text>Very interesting… And the military set up shop there too. I don't believe in coincidences like that. Looks like there really is something there we don't know about yet. Hm… You need a suit? Then buy a jacket with a gas mask—brand new. Oh, and grab a canteen too, for wiping the glass.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_6"><text>A jacket's fine, sure, but I need something more serious, with a roomy backpack. I'm not going down there with just a pistol—and what if there's some kind of beast?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_7"><text>Hmm… something more serious… I do have a very good outfit for you, with a big backpack. Not new, but still. It's called the "Tourist" suit. Exclusive piece, by the way. They don't make them like that anymore—craftsmen have gone downhill. Vergas is still puffing along, sure, but who knows how much time the Zone's given him.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_8"><text>And what do you want for such a "valuable" item? I take it you're not giving it away out of the kindness of your heart.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_9"><text>And how did you guess?! There's a small problem. Need to clear up a situation—take a trip to the Bar, to a certain someone, and ask him a few questions.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_101"><text>And he'll want something extra on top of that… Scientists already taught me that lesson, without you.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_102"><text>Alright, tell me what needs to be done.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_11"><text>Suit yourself, Marked One. I made the offer—you refused.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_12"><text>Then listen up. Lately, facts have been surfacing that Duty's main needs are being supplied through some kind of secret channel. None of the stalkers know—or are willing to share—who supplies Duty, how, or with what. As far as I can tell, even the Barkeep isn't really in the loop! That kind of situation could come back to bite us traders, who are bound by mutual agreements on currency and the list of staple goods.\nIt'd be best to clear this up as soon as possible. I've got an acquaintance among the Dutiers who can be carefully leaned on about these "phantom caravans." So what do you say? Will you go have a talk with our "planted Cossack"? If you manage to sort this out, then… my gratitude won't leave you empty-handed.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_13"><text>Any chance I could get part of that gratitude up front, you know, for the road?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_14"><text>Unbelievable… You know the way to the Bar? Then go—everything will be arranged there. His name's Plichko, just so you know.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_start_15"><text>Yeah… guess I'll go.</text></string>

<string id="plichko_rpk_start_0"><text>Hey there, soldier. Holding the line?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_1"><text>Well hello! Looking to sign up with us? Good gear, food till you're stuffed… weapons are a bit lacking for now, sure, but otherwise—welcome aboard!</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_2"><text>You paint a nice picture. But where do all these goodies come from anyway? Don't see any tailor workshops around here.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_3"><text>Don't worry, our gear isn't some local cottage-industry stuff! All factory-made. With a quality seal!</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_4"><text>Hmm… hard to believe. So how does all that factory gear even get here?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_5"><text>How does it get here? That's classified business, not for public disclosure! Though…</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_6"><text>Care to elaborate on that "though," if you don't mind?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_7"><text>I clocked you right away—you're not asking questions for nothing! Let's make a deal: first, you help me out with a little job. You look like a quick one, shouldn't be any trouble.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_8"><text>And what exactly are you talking about?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_9"><text>They put me in charge of defending a checkpoint, but we've got no serious firepower. The warehouse is short on "heavy artillery" right now, and the mutants—you see it yourself—come in packs. Lately they've gone completely nuts. Last night a pack of pseudodogs almost broke through, we barely made it out alive.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_10"><text>I get it… So what are you proposing?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_11"><text>Get me an RPK machine gun. Then not even a mouse will slip through—we'll mow all that filth down from a kilometer away. And you won't lose out either, the road will be a lot safer. You do a good deed, and then we'll have a nice, friendly talk about whatever it is you're interested in. Sound like a deal?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_12"><text>And where am I supposed to get you an RPK?!</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_13"><text>There's a warrant officer over at Agroprom, goes by Sherstyuk. You can get proper army gear from him, straight off the warehouse shelves. He's got a real soft spot for vodka… Try to strike a deal with him. Just don't drag your feet.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_start_14"><text>If it works out, you'll get your machine gun.</text></string>

<string id="plichko_rpk_done_0"><text>Got you the machine gun—this thing's a beast.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_1"><text>Thanks, Marked One. You really came through!</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_2"><text>You didn't forget about our little talk in all the excitement, did you?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_31"><text>And where's the ammo, huh? Bet you kept the armor-piercing rounds for yourself? What are we supposed to shoot with?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_41"><text>Hey, don't get your blood up—we'll load it now.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_32"><text>Duty pays its debts. So, what was it you wanted to find out?</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_42"><text>Take the machine gun… And what I wanted to know was about your gear—what kind of overseas countries it's being supplied from.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_5"><text>Alright, here's how it is. Just don't flap your gums about it too much. Our commanders have connections in the structures of one not-so-small country. And, well… you get it? They ship various scientific devices to the big shots in the Swamps, and the crates have some clever markings on them. Our guys intercept those crates, stockpile them, and then—when needed—deliver them where they're supposed to go. Catch my drift? Here, take this suit—the manufacturer's markings are still on it, I grabbed it straight from the crate. We usually scrub those off later. And remember—I didn't tell you anything, and you didn't ask me anything!</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_6"><text>Through the Swamps, huh… Hm… Alright, see you around.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_7"><text>Hey, wait up—you've bailed me out more than once now. Write this recipe down… for keeps.</text></string>
<string id="plichko_rpk_done_8"><text>If you need anything, come by.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_outfit_done_0"><text>I met with the Dutyer. Had a nice, heart-to-heart talk.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_done_1"><text>Well? Don't drag it out. Where do they get their gear from? Find out?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_done_2"><text>He let it slip that they pull it straight from the factories, under the cover of supplies for the scientists in the Swamps. Here's their armor, with the manufacturer's markings still intact.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_done_3"><text>I see… So that's where Duty's abundance comes from.\nAnd what use is… although… Yeah, it's clear enough.\nWhy are you standing there like a post?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_done_4"><text>You owe me compensation for expenses and the rest of the reward! You didn't forget, did you?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_done_5"><text>What people… Instead of sitting down for a calm, friendly chat about life, remembering the good old days… everyone's always running, rushing somewhere.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_done_6"><text>Sidorovich! Get out of your basement sometime, take a walk to the ATP, admire the scenery—you could get so many pleasant impressions… Me, I don't have the time.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_done_7"><text>Don't get smart. Here's your suit, a water flask, and some medical supplies.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_done_8"><text>Generous, didn't expect that. Though the suit is kind of… well…</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_done_9"><text>Take the suit to Vergas to get it fixed up. The old man could use the spare change too. If you find anything interesting in that underground, bring it by—we'll see, maybe something mutually profitable will come of it. And don't forget about our business at Agroprom.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_outfit_done_10"><text>You're getting old, Sidor… getting old…</text></string>
<!-- marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_new -->

<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_new_21"><text>I've got a couple of packs for an AK.</text></string>

<!-- barmen_outfit -->
<string id="tex_barmen_outfit"><text>\nThe Barman asked me to look into a shipment that two stalkers agreed to deliver but never brought to the client. In return, he promised a good suit with a mask. One of them was seen at the Garbage.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_0"><text>Barman, I've got urgent business.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_1"><text>Urgent, you say? Maybe it can wait?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_2"><text>I need a good suit, with a gas mask—or better yet, a full mask. Got to go into some underground place, and the gas down there is brutal.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_31"><text>Decided to become a digger? Didn't hire yourself out as Mole's assistant, did you?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_32"><text>I don't have anything good. Ask Sidor, or go talk to the military.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_4"><text>I need to check something in the underground at Agroprom. Supposedly Strelok had a base there. Maybe I'll find something… maybe remember something.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_5"><text>Interesting, very interesting… And the military settled there too. All of this is strange.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_6"><text>I need decent armor, with a roomy backpack. Can't go down there with just a pistol—what if there's as much wildlife as in a zoo.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_7"><text>Hmm… decent. I do have a very good suit for you, with a roomy backpack, though it's not new. One Dutyer handed it over to settle a debt. Duty hunters sometimes wear suits like these when they go on raids against monster lairs. Reinforce them with something special. Get it? An exclusive item—almost nobody makes them like this anymore, craftsmen are getting worse. Longshanks is still puffing along, sure, but who knows how much time the Zone has left him.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_8"><text>And what do you want for such a "valuable" item? I take it you're not giving it away out of the goodness of your heart.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_9"><text>And how did you guess?! There's a small problem. Need to clear something up—go to the Garbage, to a certain person, and find out a few things.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_91"><text>And he'll want something extra on top… Scientists—we've been through that already. Count me out.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_101"><text>As you wish. Everyone chooses their own path.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_92"><text>Tell me what needs to be done.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_102"><text>Not long ago I sent two jokers to deliver a package to someone. Two for reliability, so they'd keep an eye on each other. It wasn't anything extremely important—just a couple of good artifacts in a locked container. But the delivery was urgent, and it never reached the addressee. Both of them vanished at once. It's the Zone, sure, they could've gotten into trouble. But just recently I was told one of them was spotted. So I want you to go see him and find out what's what. Maybe they resold it—which I really wouldn't like—or maybe they fell out with each other and ditched the job—I don't know. Their relationship isn't my concern; I'm only interested in business and money. You get the idea: I need them to return the contents or an equivalent value, then I'll resend the package with someone more reliable. The client's annoyed, sure, but he's still waiting for what he ordered. Bottom line—sort this out as quickly as you can. And when you're back, we'll discuss your reward.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_11"><text>And if they refuse? Then what?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_12"><text>Then do your best—I only care about the result. Remember who you're looking for.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_13"><text>I'll go talk to him.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_start_14"><text>I've already made my choice.</text></string>

<string id="barmen_outfit_done_0"><text>I found your couriers.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_done_1"><text>What about those screwups? What happened to the shipment?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_done_2"><text>Same old story—they got themselves into trouble. Here, take this artifact, they sent it with apologies. They promised to return the shipment contents to you before nightfall.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_done_3"><text>Good. And what kind of artifact is this? Strange one… I'll give it to the Docent, he'll sort it out. You're done, then?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_done_4"><text>I am. Where's the suit?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_done_5"><text>I set something aside for you in advance. Take the armor, a water flask, and some medical supplies. The suit's seen better days, sure—but take it to Longshanks, he'll patch it up. The man's got to earn his bread too.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_done_6"><text>Yeah… I'll go.</text></string>

<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_101"><text>Stalker, you looking for someone?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_102"><text>Looks like I'm looking for you… The Barman sent me. Where's the shipment? Don't give me that surprised look—the container you were carrying with someone else to the client. Where is it?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_103"><text>Damn bad luck… I thought this would all blow over in time. Here's how it went: we had to run from a chimera, and there was that container… Heavy thing. The chimera slashed me—just the tip of a claw, glancing blow, but I still get bleeding at night. I ditched the container, figured we'd pick it up after fighting back. Then an emission started, had to look for shelter. When we came back, the container was torn open and empty. We searched the area and found a couple of rare artifacts—"Night Star." I figure some anomaly shifted after the emission and ripped the crate open, the artifacts fell out. They wouldn't have just appeared after the emission—there'd have been capsules then. And now, how do we bring a busted container to the client? And without it, the "Stars" radiate like hell. Can't go back to the Barman either—he'd skin us alive. He'd say the shipment wasn't these artifacts, but a pair of "Pendulums"—and you'd never prove otherwise… My partner said we should lie low for now, pretend we vanished. We split the "Stars," but agreed not to sell them yet, just hid them—in case we still had to return them. Looks like that time's come…</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_104"><text>You ever heard of the Barman just letting his goods go? He wants you to return the contents or an equivalent value as soon as possible. Otherwise, he'll get pissed. Remember a simple truth: nothing ever just blows over—and when it resurfaces, it's usually too late to fix anything.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_105"><text>Yeah, I get it… But I've only got one "Night Star," the other's with my partner. And I've got to go to my stash for mine. Maybe you could go see my partner? While I'm running back and forth… time's already tight, like you said. What do you think?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_1061"><text>For crying out loud, you sat around waiting for this to sort itself out… and now I've got to run around like my ass is on fire? To hell with you!</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_1062"><text>Is it far? I had my own plans.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_107"><text>Not really. He's usually around the Gut, seems to have hooked up with the hunters. But he might be roaming somewhere nearby.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_108"><text>Damn it… Who am I looking for, then?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_109"><text>Help me out, brother, I'll remember it for life. My buddy's a dark-haired guy:</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_110"><text>Uh-huh… off I go.</text></string>

<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_201"><text>Any news, or are you just passing through?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_2021"><text>Just passing through.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_2022"><text>I found your buddy. We talked… sharp guy. He promised to come see you tomorrow and bring his share. Also said to pass along apologies to the Barman from you, as I understand it—something material.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_203"><text>Ah… well… I've got something. Left over from previous runs. Not quite an artifact, seems to have no properties, but I've heard scientists are very interested in these. Pass it on to the Barman from us, he'll sort it out.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_204"><text>Hurry up with the shipment—time's ticking…</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_1_dlg_301"><text>Anything else?</text></string>

<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_101"><text>Stalker, looking for someone?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_102"><text>You, pal. I'm here from your partner—the one you botched the Barman's delivery with. You catch what this smells like? That's right. You need to return the contents, and preferably fast. Your partner went to fetch his share, so the rest is on you.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_103"><text>And who are you supposed to be? You've got a lot of swagger.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_104"><text>Name's Marked One. Been here a short while—or maybe a long one, can't remember. But I do know this: your business with the Barman won't just sort itself out. Traders have long memories… you get the idea.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_105"><text>Yeah… I get it, I get it. If it wasn't you, someone else would've come—meaner.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_106"><text>Quick learner. So grab your artifact, get to your partner, and the two of you go beg the Barman—maybe he'll forgive you.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_107"><text>I was thinking the same, but… I don't have that artifact anymore. When I crossed the Cordon, I sat down in the village with those Wolkhov idiots to drink and snack—and things got out of hand.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_108"><text>Decided to show the lads what a hotshot stalker you are—blew a good artifact just like that, and not even your own. Familiar story. You didn't just screw yourself, you set up your partner too. The Barman won't sort out who owes what—he'll want it all. What're you gonna do? You're almost out of time.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_109"><text>I swear, I meant to return everything… Listen, I've got an idea—will you help me? When I was boozing it up on the Cordon and bragging about the rare artifact we were drinking away, some guy told me you can supposedly brew the same one from a "Slime" and a "Stone Flower." A seasoned stalker shared the recipe with him, but he trusted his memory, didn't write it down—and of course forgot. Believe it or not, I've had a "Stone Flower" stashed away for a rainy day, and I found a "Slime" just yesterday. I thought about getting the full recipe from Tooth, but first—I'm dead broke, and second—the Bar's off-limits to me anyway. Save us, Marked One—they'll whack me and my partner both.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_1091"><text>You finally came to your senses. Sat around waiting, and now I'm supposed to chase down a recipe for you? Get yourself out of it.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_1092"><text>That's the thing—both of you. If not for my own interest in this… Alright. I'll pay Tooth a visit. I think the Barman will wait till I get back.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_110"><text>Yeah, thanks. I'll go hunt some critters in the meantime—sure something'll be useful for brewing.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_111"><text>Just don't get eaten yourself. Would be a fine mess if all my running around turned out to be for nothing…</text></string>

<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_1_dlg_0"><text>Tooth, I need the recipe for a "Night Star" from a "Slime" and a "Stone Flower."</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_1_dlg_1"><text>I've got it. What, forgot the other brewing components? Happens. I can dig through my notes… when I've got the time… Sheesh.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_1_dlg_2"><text>Alright—so how much?</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_1_dlg_3"><text>Why jump straight to "how much"? Not everything can be bought with money… at least, not always.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_1_dlg_4"><text>Fine. Then what do you want for the recipe?</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_1_dlg_5"><text>I want you to check a lead for me. Trivial stuff—probably bunk—but I need all options covered. Let's do it like this: you put down a deposit, say, ten PDAs. If you come back empty-handed, they're mine and you get your recipe. If there's a result, I return everything and throw in something extra—on top of the recipe, of course. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_1_dlg_61"><text>Trivial, you say? Uh-huh… Fine, I'll take your word. Wait here—I'll be back with the PDAs.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_1_dlg_62"><text>Sounds fishy. I think I'll pass.</text></string>

<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_0"><text>About that "deposit" for your errand…</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_1"><text>Well? Brought the PDAs?</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_21"><text>Yeah. Take them.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_22"><text>No. I'm backing out. Got a bad feeling about this.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_31"><text>Excellent! Then listen up. You've probably seen the abandoned vehicles rusting along the roads in the Gut—especially under the ruined overpass. All of it was part of a large evacuation convoy that once hauled property out of… various places that ended up inside the Zone's perimeter. Most of that transport's been looted long ago, but every now and then you hear rumors of lucky stalkers bringing traders something new from there. Recently I got a tip about a spot where the convoy stopped—a gas station. Why do I think something interesting might still be there? I sent a man to scout it. A few days ago he reported seeing some serious-looking types poking around the station and nearby, clearly searching for something. They didn't finish, though—a big family of boars drove them off. My observer didn't dare stick his nose in after that.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_32"><text>Your call.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_4"><text>So you want me to head to the Gut and check if anything interesting's left at that gas station?</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_5"><text>Exactly. And I reckon if there's anywhere worth looking, it's inside the building. The surroundings have been turned over a hundred times, but inside… Say someone from the convoy ducked in during the stop and hid something there—what do you think?</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_6"><text>You're asking me? I don't even know what they were hauling. Or… are you so confident because you know more than you're saying?</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_7"><text>You're sharp, Marked One. Yeah, I did get info from my informant—he went to the mainland to talk to one of the convoy drivers. The driver hasn't been in the Zone for ages, but he remembered that evacuation. Shared some interesting details. Riding with him in the truck was—let's call him—a courier. During the stop, he got out with a bundle, went into the gas station building, and stayed gone a while. Came back without the bundle.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_8"><text>So? Could've been anything in that bundle, and anything he did with it. And why do you think it hasn't been found yet? You're holding something back.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_9"><text>What do you think those "serious-looking" guys were sniffing around for? They likely got the same tip I did. If they had reason to believe the story, I'm not about to let it slide either. I'm not insisting the bundle will be there—but I want it checked.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_10"><text>Wants it checked… Feels like you're still not telling me everything, but to hell with it. I can go to the gas station and carefully search the inside. I'll even shoot some boars if they're still there. But don't expect me to dig up the whole place or check every bush around.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_11"><text>That's perfect. I'm not asking for more.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_2_dlg_12"><text>You bet. Don't forget—I've already put down a "deposit," and I'm not breaking my back for you beyond what's necessary for my own loot.</text></string>

<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_3_dlg_0"><text>There are, and what kind! I'm just not sure whether for you they're simply bad… or a complete clusterf—</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_3_dlg_1"><text>Here we go… You know how many times people have tried to start a conversation with me in that tone?</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_3_dlg_2"><text>Aren't you afraid this one might be the last? Because I'm real tempted to put a bullet in your head for stunts like this!</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_3_dlg_3"><text>Don't try to bluff me—I'm not some nobody here. Instead of yelling, you'd better tell me properly what happened.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_3_dlg_4"><text>What happened is I nearly got whacked at that gas station by those very same "serious-looking types." The place was clearly under surveillance, and as soon as I went inside, they set up an ambush on the way out. Nearly got me—barely fought my way through. For the record, I didn't find anything there except a fresh corpse in the back room, looked like an ordinary stalker. Oh, and the boars your observer warned about showed up too. So yeah, the full package of "fun."</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_3_dlg_5"><text>I see… So they knew or suspected someone might come, since they were watching the place. I don't deal in cheap setups like that, Marked One—you can take my word for it. Think about it: what would I gain? A bad reputation hurts my business badly. Which means either you blabbed about my errand to someone and got yourself a warm welcome… or—which is far more likely—my informant was playing a double game. Knowing of my interest in the evacuation convoy, he could've guessed I'd hire someone to search, and shared his "ideas" with those thugs. If they hadn't found the bundle yet, he might've even fed them a story that my man would know exactly where to look. That's why they waited for you so patiently.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_3_dlg_6"><text>Hmm… sounds plausible. Let's say that's how it went. But who was that dead man in the utility room? Could it have been your informant? Found out he was playing both sides, so they slit his throat… it does line up. Either way, even if I agree to believe your version, this won't fly without solid compensation, don't you think?</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_3_dlg_7"><text>Ah, so we've moved into bargaining territory—familiar ground. In case you forgot, our deal was that if you came back empty-handed, you'd get no PDAs and no extra bonuses, just the recipe. You were warned about the "gentlemen of fortune" regardless, so from my side everything's clean. What happened to you is pure force majeure.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_3_dlg_8"><text>Nothing but profiteers everywhere. One won't even tell the time for free, another would strangle you over an extra bandage. Fine, I've got you figured out. Dictate the recipe and let's be done.</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_3_dlg_9"><text>Hold on, Marked One, don't boil over. I just wanted to test your reaction—see if you'd start pressing for more reward, or if keeping your word mattered more than money. You handled it right, so here's a compromise: your "deposit" stays with me, I'll upload the recipe to your PDA right now, and… here's a little extra from me—a Walther P99. I carry one myself. So, no hard feelings?</text></string>
<string id="zub_night_star_receipt_3_dlg_10"><text>Now that's more like it. Alright, let's call it even. Take care.</text></string>

<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_201"><text>Hey there! Learn the recipe, or just passing by?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_2021"><text>I'm here on a different matter.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_2022"><text>Alright, write this down: toss a cat's tail, a snork foot, a "Slime," and a "Stone Flower" into a Whirligig for 7–12 minutes.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_203"><text>You're a real man, Marked One—a real one. I even traded Ignat for some sausage, knew you wouldn't let me down. Smells awful, sure, but it barely spoils and it's filling.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_204"><text>Didn't trade for their moonshine too? Folks say it's lethal stuff. Heh-heh…</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_205"><text>Still joking around… enough. I'm done with that now—quit for good. And tell my partner I'll be coming to see him no later than tomorrow. And have him pass his apologies to the Barman through you—he'll know which ones.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_206"><text>Where were you, such a sharp one, earlier?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_outfit_2_dlg_301"><text>Forget something?</text></string>
<!-- sherstuk_outfit -->
<string id="tex_sherstuk_outfit"><text>\nSherstyuk asked me to deliver crates of provisions to the military in the Swamps. In return, he promised to get hold of an army suit with a mask.</text></string>

<string id="sherstuk_outfit_start_11"><text>Pop a bottle open, and I'll answer all your questions with great pleasure. Feeling kind of gloomy today.</text></string>
<string id="sherstuk_outfit_start_12"><text>Not in the mood for talking late at night. Come by in the morning… and, uh… bring a bottle—for the hangover.</text></string>
<string id="sherstuk_outfit_start_21"><text>Why didn't I think of that before?</text></string>
<string id="sherstuk_outfit_start_22"><text>I always carry one with me—to flush out radiation.</text></string>

<string id="sherstuk_outfit_start_5"><text>You need a suit? Heading north, are you? Why would you want that? You can settle in just fine here too—even as a stalker.</text></string>

<string id="sherstuk_outfit_start_92"><text>We need to get provisions to our soldiers there. They're stationed by the tower on the southern edge of the Swamps, guarding some scientists.

<string id="sherstuk_outfit_2start_1"><text>Oh, you showed up?! Didn't expect that… I've prepared the shipment—there, under the bush. Canned food and other provisions. Try to deliver it quickly. Wouldn't want the commanders showing up any day now—I don't need extra trouble. And one more thing… a personal request. The soldiers there set up a small business, trading ammo for food. Tell them the brass isn't aware yet, but Sherstyuk sees and knows everything. They'll get the message. And I'm warning you—get it done, or don't show your face again. I'll be waiting for your report.</text></string>

His birthday's coming up.</text></string>

<!-- Äóìåíêî -->
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_101"><text>So, if I understand correctly — Marked One?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_102"><text>Yes, Marked One. And who might you be? Feeling a bit uneasy standing next to such a menacing stranger.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_103"><text>I thought your kind had nerves of steel. Major Dumenko, counterintelligence.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_104"><text>What do I owe the pleasure?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_105"><text>Warrant Officer Sherstyuk told me you agreed to help him deal with a certain problem. Judging by the fact that you're standing here now, you handled it well.\nI could also use the help of a quick and military-friendly stalker. Catch my drift? Fine, just listen for now.\nWe're currently near our base, at the former Agroprom Research Institute. Some time ago, a directive came down from above: ensure the maximum possible level of security in this area. The local commander reinforced the posts, put snipers on the towers, mined the holes in the perimeter fence, and so on — all strictly by the book, according to garrison and guard duty regulations.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_106"><text>And why are you telling me all this…?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_107"><text>At ease! Don't interrupt. I'll finish, then you'll understand where this is going.\nSo. We more or less secured the Institute's perimeter against unauthorized access, but during an inspection I discovered that there is a descent into the underground right on the base — and from there, all kinds of filth keep pouring out! We tried collapsing the passage several times — didn't help. Then I sent a group of contract soldiers down there to clear it out. Only one came back. Shaking all over, mumbling something — can't make out a damn thing. That's when the idea came to me to turn to an experienced stalker.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_108"><text>I see. So you don't want to send your own men anymore, but throwing a random stalker into the meat grinder is fine — no great loss, right? Want to ride into paradise on someone else's back, Major? Earn yourself a medal? And how do you even imagine this working? A group of trained soldiers couldn't handle it, but a lone stalker supposedly can?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_109"><text>Don't get smart with me, Marked One! I'm not sending you to finish the cleanup — I'm asking you to find out what happened to the missing soldiers. You know the difference between "missing in action" and "killed in action," don't you? For all we know, they could've gotten lost down there in those catacombs, or some anomaly isn't letting them back out — in that case, they might need help. Bottom line: I need clarity so I can understand what steps to take next.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_1091"><text>Doesn't really put a smile on my face, poking around dark basements looking for your people, Major. What if they start shooting in panic? Assuming they're even alive. You said it yourself — plenty of monsters down there. No, you go looking for your clarity without me.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_1092"><text>Let's assume I agree. Especially since I have my own interests in that underground. Might as well help you along the way. So, are you suggesting I use the descent on your base?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_1101"><text>Predictable. Then get lost. And don't let me see your face again, understood? And keep this in mind — I'll warn Sherstyuk that you're on my personal blacklist. I'm sure after that he won't dare do business with you.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_1102"><text>No, that won't do. See the ventilation shaft sticking out on the hill? You can go down there. Be warned — strict security protocols are in effect, and we regularly mine the approaches to the shaft. When you're ready, I'll order the mines to be taken off combat mode until nightfall — that is, until 21:00. At night, all threatened directions must be covered — orders are orders. If you don't make it down in time, look for another entrance. There should be one more near the eastern complex of the Institute. In short, I'm expecting you during daylight so I can give my men the go-ahead. Then we'll go over the details.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_112"><text>Understood. There's just one small issue: I heard that down there the air is heavily contaminated — without a proper gas mask you won't last long…</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_113"><text>What, hinting that you don't have one? Want me to hand over my own suit? Go haggle with Sherstyuk. He'll trade you a tank for vodka if you bring him five truckloads of it. Or look within your stalker circles.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_114"><text>A better suit will come in handy for me sooner or later anyway. Might as well start looking for one now…</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_131"><text>Did I warn you not to show your face again? I did. Now deal with the consequences.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_141"><text>And what are you doing here at this hour? We had an agreement.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_142"><text>I was just… passing by.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_151"><text>Ready to head down into the underground?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_1521"><text>Not yet. Need to put together some decent gear.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_1522"><text>Yes. Give me the task. Would be nice to also clarify… the size of my fee.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_153"><text>It's fairly simple. You need to go through as much of the underground as possible, assess the situation, and find traces of the missing soldiers. If they're alive, help them get out. If they're dead… well, carrying bodies out alone would obviously be impossible, so take their army dog tags. That way we can at least identify the fallen by their personal numbers, notify headquarters, inform the families… you understand.\nAs for the reward — don't worry about it yet, focus on the task. But I'll prepare something substantial for you, officer's word.\nOne more thing. On your way to the shaft, try not to be seen by our soldiers. They have orders to shoot at any movement. That's all. I'll be waiting for your report. Understood?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_201"><text>Have you already been underground and found traces of the missing soldiers? No? Then what is it?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_301"><text>You're back?! I was informed that you went down into the underground. Quite a bit of time passed — I was starting to think that was it for you. Did you find the missing soldiers?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_302"><text>I did… though there wasn't much left of them. The rats will finish the rest soon enough. Plenty of monsters down there — you were right. A whole nest of bloodsuckers settled in. In short, it's no place for people. Dark, damp, poisoned air, and death hanging in the air.\nHere — I collected the dog tags, as you asked.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_303"><text>Pity about the lads. Died for nothing. But bitter truth is better than ignorance — that's what I believe. Thank you, Marked One. This is for your help.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_304"><text>I was hoping to find my own truth down there. Instead, I've got more questions than answers. Take care.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_351"><text>Anything else?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_401"><text>Did you find out what's going on in the Gut?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_start_dialog_501"><text>I told you — you're dismissed.</text></string>

<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_start_dialog_0"><text>While wandering through the catacombs on your assignment, I stumbled upon… something of great interest to me. Could you order your men not to mine the underground entrance on the hill during the day? It's a very convenient descent for… well, for getting around quickly, where I need to go.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_start_dialog_1"><text>You're being cagey, Marked One. Some stalker business of yours? Frankly, I don't care. Complete one more assignment and we'll call it a deal. I'll even throw in a little something for your troubles.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_start_dialog_2"><text>Well… I suppose I can give it a try. And how can I help the dear army this time?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_start_dialog_3"><text>Being ironic? Very funny.\nI assume you've been to the area known as the Gut, haven't you? Perhaps you also noticed the column of rusting vehicles near the overpass. All valuables were looted long ago, but important technical documentation was stored in fireproof cases — useless to the uninitiated. It could have survived and, according to our intelligence, until recently it was still somewhere there. I sent my men to verify this information and soon received a report that they managed to locate a sealed case, which presumably contains what we're looking for. The squad leader reported they were heading back along the northern road. That was the last transmission we received. They've been silent for several days now, and frankly, I fear the worst. Among their equipment were special GPS trackers. The last signal came from the northern part of the Gut, almost at the border with the Dark Valley. Your task is to check the area, find out what happened to the squad, and if it turns out they're all dead, locate that case and bring it to me.\nI didn't want to involve outsiders until the very end, but the remaining troops under my command are tied up in another important operation, and time is running out. I'm afraid the documents may slip away for good this time. Questions?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_start_dialog_4"><text>What if I find your soldiers, but don't find the case?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_start_dialog_5"><text>That's unlikely. You see, the squad consisted of seasoned, experienced fighters. But they're trained to fight other people, not unknown creatures. So I'm inclined to believe that humans were hardly involved in their disappearance, and mutants — as you understand — have no use for a case. Therefore, find the squad, and you'll find the case.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_start_dialog_6"><text>Sounds reasonable. All right, I'm in.</text></string>

<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_done_dialog_0"><text>Greetings, Commander!</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_done_dialog_1"><text>Don't clown around. Did you find out what happened in the Gut?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_done_dialog_2"><text>You were right about the monsters. It looks like your men ran into a Controller and its entourage. That's one hell of a creature — makes your hair stand on end. Not just on your head, either. It twists a man's brain inside out in an instant, especially if you meet it in open ground. Its entourage usually consists of zombified stalkers — very tough guys, not every bullet will stop them. Took some doing, to put it mildly. As for your men — they didn't make it. All dead…</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_done_dialog_3"><text>That's more or less what I expected, though I still hoped… And the case? Did you find the case?</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_done_dialog_4"><text>Of course. You were right about that too. The Controller had no use for it. Here you go.</text></string>
<!-- ïîêàçàëè Ñèäîðó -->
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_done_dialog_51"><text>Yes, looks like the one. Why is the seal broken?</text></string>
<!-- íå ïîêàçûâàëè Ñèäîðó -->
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_done_dialog_52"><text>Yes, looks like the one. Well done!</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_done_dialog_61"><text>How should I know?! I brought it in the condition I found it in. Maybe the seal broke when it fell, or maybe your boys got curious. What about my request? The mines.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_done_dialog_62"><text>You can admire your briefcase later. What about my request? The mines.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_done_dialog_71"><text>Unlikely. Extremely unlikely. Seems to me you're not telling me everything, Marked One. Still, fine—the contents of the case appear to be intact, so you've completed the task. During daylight hours the passage will be open; don't try going there at night.\nThis is for you—a present. You've earned it. That's all, you're dismissed.</text></string>
<string id="agr_dumenko_kolonna_done_dialog_72"><text>As agreed. During daylight hours the passage will be open; don't try going there at night.\nThis is for you—a present. You've earned it. That's all, you're dismissed.</text></string>
<!-- upgrade_dialogs -->
<string id="vergas_upgrade_dialog_0"><text>Why so pensive, old-timer?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_upgrade_dialog_1"><text>Ah, Marked One. Here's the thing… Lately some stalkers have been bringing in suits for repair that are soaked with some kind of chemical. I won't take on repairs like that—I'm afraid I'll only make things worse.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_upgrade_dialog_2"><text>Why's that? You're a jack-of-all-trades.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_upgrade_dialog_3"><text>Don't try to sweet-talk the old man. You'd be better off heading to the Swamps and finding out what those eggheads have come up with there. Might be some use in it for me, too. They say this impregnation makes a suit a lot tougher—you can carry more weight, and wear and tear is reduced.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_upgrade_dialog_4"><text>You could've just said it's purely a commercial interest.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_upgrade_dialog_5"><text>What commercial interest? I'm just curious what kind of clever trick they've cooked up there.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_upgrade_dialog_6"><text>If I'm in the Swamps, I'll ask around.</text></string>
<!-- upgrade_2dialogs -->
<string id="vergas_upgrade_2dialog_0"><text>I've taken care of your request.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_upgrade_2dialog_1"><text>Marked One, what are you talking about? My memory's failing me—remind me.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_upgrade_2dialog_2"><text>About the suit impregnation in the Swamps. You were curious about what they use and how.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_upgrade_2dialog_3"><text>Ah, so what did science come up with?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_upgrade_2dialog_4"><text>They soak the suits in a decoction made from zombie hands and then treat them with some kind of rays. The technology's experimental and almost classified. The suit really does get tougher, but the effect doesn't last—only three or four days… and then it's goodbye.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_upgrade_2dialog_5"><text>Zombie hands?! Thank the Zone it's not their guts. And the fact the impregnation only lasts three or four days—that's good. Won't be left without work. Here, take this kit, and stay clear of those academics. The nerve of them, coming up with something like that…</text></string>
<string id="vergas_upgrade_2dialog_6"><text>Take care, old-timer. And you said it wasn't about business.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_glavn_upgrade_dialog_0"><text>People say you can reinforce armor?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_upgrade_dialog_1"><text>They're already talking? Figures… Did a favor for a few stalkers and the gypsy mail's spread it everywhere. We've only just managed to apply this technology in practice.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_upgrade_dialog_2"><text>So how much does it cost, and what exactly do you need?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_upgrade_dialog_3"><text>Here's the thing, Marked One. Sergeich, our professor, is worried that this experimental, not fully tested method might leak out somewhere, and then some unforeseen consequences could follow. He's concerned about his reputation. I'm afraid he might shut this whole armor-reinforcement operation down. Without his approval, I won't do anything. Go talk to him yourself—maybe you'll come to an agreement.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_upgrade_dialog_4"><text>I'll go talk to him.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="marsh_glavn_upgrade_2dialog_0"><text>Demyan, I've reached an agreement with the professor about the reinforcement.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_upgrade_2dialog_1"><text>Ivan Sergeyevich has given his approval.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_upgrade_2dialog_2"><text>What's required for that? And, if it's not a secret, what exactly did you come up with there?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_upgrade_2dialog_3"><text>Don't worry, it's not lethal. Of course, not everything is as smooth as we'd like. Let me explain:\nFirst, the effect of the "reinforcement" doesn't last very long—three to four days at most.\nSecond, the compound can be obtained from the muscle tissue of a "walking dead man"—a zombie, as stalkers call them. There aren't many of those, so mass-producing the "compound" isn't possible. That's why we have to refuse many requests. Still, we do have a small supply.\nThird, this procedure is quite costly. Equipment expenses, energy consumption, labor… I think you understand. A pair of first-tier artifacts or one second-tier artifact should be enough to cover the… expenses. But we only accept those in good condition—keep that in mind. It's important for our research.\nSo if you need it, drop by.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_upgrade_2dialog_4"><text>So it'll cost me either a couple of first-tier artifacts or one second-tier one?! And the artifacts can't be too worn, either… Did I get that right? Sounds pretty expensive.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_upgrade_2dialog_5"><text>What did you expect, Marked One? Be glad we didn't turn you away outright.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glavn_upgrade_2dialog_6"><text>You toil and toil, and then—bam—more expenses again.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_upgrade_dialog_0"><text>Demyan sent me to you for permission. To reinforce a suit.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_upgrade_dialog_1"><text>You're here about that too?! What a nuisance… As an experiment, we reinforced suits for stalkers who are among our regular helpers. But I'll repeat myself—only as an experiment. The reinforcement technology is quite complex, costly, and not yet fully studied. The positive effect achieved by applying this substance to a suit turned out to be very unstable. We still don't know what impact this technology has on the person wearing the suit. That's why I don't want to put people at risk for the sake of questionable scientific achievements.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_upgrade_dialog_2"><text>I'm agreeing voluntarily. Your conscience will be clear.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_upgrade_dialog_3"><text>I like you, Marked One, so let's do it this way… Our graduate students always have a couple of crazy ideas—I envy their energy. Talk to them, help where you can. Unfortunately, we have few people with real survival experience in the Zone. And those we do have, how should I put it gently, tend to help us mostly out of mercantile motives. Everyone always needs something.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_upgrade_dialog_4"><text>What did you expect, Professor? To survive in the Zone you need resources, and those usually come either for artifacts or for services. I've yet to meet anyone who gives me something for nothing.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_upgrade_dialog_5"><text>Perhaps you're right. I find your persistence and straightforwardness appealing. Then… a favor for a favor. Talk to the graduate students—maybe one of them will offer you a job. Provide whatever assistance you can. And then we'll return to the discussion about reinforcement. Does that arrangement suit you?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_upgrade_dialog_6"><text>It does. I'll go talk to them.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_upgrade_2dialog_0"><text>So, what about the upgrade?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_upgrade_2dialog_1"><text>I've been told you did a great deal of work. Thank you. I'll inform Demyan—he'll take care of everything. And… one more thing… Don't refuse to help our staff in the future. I've already mentioned their crazy ideas, but that's what science is built on. What once seemed fantastic is now mundane reality. We can always be useful to each other.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_upgrade_2dialog_2"><text>Who's refusing?! I'll help as much as I can.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_upgrade_2dialog_3"><text>I don't want you to misunderstand me. It's just a request.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_upgrade_2dialog_4"><text>Agreed, Professor.</text></string>

<string id="barmen_scafandr_start_2"><text>So when it comes to going into that damn laboratory, it's suddenly "for everyone's benefit," but when it comes to a suit, it's "not for free."</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_start_3"><text>Oh, stop playing the offended one. Finding a way north is in your interests too. So calm down and listen. I've got a job for you… a personal one. I wouldn't trust it to just anyone. Take it on, and you'll get a proper suit — a real armored spacesuit.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_start_41"><text>Alright, say what needs to be done — just as long as I don't have to off anyone, you know what I mean.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_start_42"><text>I know your routine. First it's a run from one end of the Zone to the other, your ass on fire, and in the end nothing but losses from that kind of "exercise." I'll pass — I'll look elsewhere.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_start_51"><text>Not long ago, one guy used to drop by here all the time. I liked having a good, heartfelt chat with him, over a mug of tea with a little something in it, talking about life. Yeah… Then he stopped showing up. I figured the Zone finally wore him down too. But the other day a stalker mentioned the guy's still alive. Maybe you can find him? Ask why he doesn't come by anymore. Maybe he took offense? Or maybe he needs help with something. Just don't drag it out… alright? The stalker who saw my friend is Vovan Dneva. He's working somewhere in the Swamps.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_start_52"><text>Suit yourself. Maybe you'll find something better.</text></string>

<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_103"><text>Alright then, we'll know each other, Marked One. What brings you here — business, or just dropped by for a visit?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_104"><text>Depends on what you call business. The Barman is wondering — why don't you come to the bar anymore? He's worried he might have offended you somehow.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_105"><text>Why don't I come by? Well… how do I put it… Embarrassing to admit, but… I'm hiding. I owe Baldy — damn fool me, got talked into throwing dice with him. At first it was small stakes, seemed like luck was on my side. But once we started playing big… I went bust. Even borrowed to keep playing. Lost big. So the Bar's off-limits for me now. I've scraped together something already, but I can't pay off the whole debt yet.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_106"><text>I've heard about your debt. I've got a bit of loot.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_107"><text>And you're ready to help me just like that? I'm in deep — I owe two third-tier artifacts. I've got one, but where to get the second — no idea… And that bastard Baldy insists the artifacts have to be in good condition.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_1081"><text>You sure had yourself a night, no doubt about it. If it weren't for my own interest in this matter… and the Barman asked me to help you. Alright, I'll try to sort out your problem. Wait here, don't go anywhere. I need to swing by my stash.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_1082"><text>You sure had yourself a night, no doubt about it. If it weren't for my own interest in this matter… and the Barman asked me to help you. Alright, here's a suitable artifact.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_1091"><text>Where would I go? I'll wait.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_1092"><text>Well I'll be… Thanks. I'll be at the bar in a few days then. Tell the Barman so. Let him wait.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_1102"><text>I will, I will…</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_201"><text>Marked One, well hello. How are you?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_202"><text>Doing alright. You said you needed a third-tier artifact, right?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_203"><text>Yes, badly. In good condition.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_2042"><text>Soon. Wait.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_2041"><text>I've got one. Here, take it.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_dlg_301"><text>Hey, Marked One, what are you doing here? I'm heading to the bar soon, and you're still busy with your own business?</text></string>

<string id="barmen_scafandr_proha_0"><text>People say you're the one in charge of pouring around here?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_proha_1"><text>What?! Want me to pour happiness into your ugly mug with an axe?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_proha_2"><text>Sorry, bad choice of words. I need a couple of jars of your moonshine. The guys in the Swamps asked for it badly.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_proha_3"><text>What, did Silvestr run out of booze? The boys feeling sad?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_proha_4"><text>Stalkers say — and I've heard it myself — your stuff packs more punch than his technician's brew. So, can we make a deal?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_proha_51"><text>Hmm… Maybe we can, if you do one thing for me. Been wanting a new cloak sewn from flesh hides for a while now. This one's completely worn out, filthy, won't clean anymore. There's an old man in the Swamps, goes by Stepanich — you probably know him. Order the cloak from him. Just a work outfit for me, nothing fancy. By the time you're back, the first run will be ready. And don't even think about trying to pass off some worn-out rag as new.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_proha_61"><text>A new cloak?! I'll need to think about that…</text></string>

<string id="barmen_scafandr_2proha_0"><text>I'm here about your moonshine. The guys in the Swamps must be waiting already…</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_2proha_1"><text>Ah, it's you, Marked One. Brought the cloak?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_2proha_2"><text>Brand new, just like we agreed.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_2proha_3"><text>Look at that workmanship — can't even see the seams, and the finishing…</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_2proha_4"><text>Prosha, you can admire it later. The boys are burning up over there.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_2proha_5"><text>They won't die. Here, take the jars — pure distillate… crystal clear.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_2proha_6"><text>God, it stinks like hell…</text></string>

<string id="barmen_scafandr_done_0"><text>I met your friend.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_done_1"><text>And? How is he — alive and well? Did he say when he'd come to the bar?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_done_2"><text>He's planning to come by in a few days. He owes Baldy. I helped your friend out a bit, like you asked. I think it'll work itself out.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_scafandr_done_31"><text>Yeah, I figured. I knew I could count on you. Now to business — the PSZ-9Md armored spacesuit. The batch was made to order for a defense research institute.

We started singing left and right that the stash was gone, that stalkers stole it. But it never went anywhere! It's all hidden in a safe place. And nobody knows where! Only the Boss!

<string id="sidor_scafandr_ignat_1"><text>Liked it that much, or decided to start a business?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_scafandr_ignat_2"><text>Some brothers in the Dark Valley are complaining about Borov's rations. Asked me to bring them... something tasty. And a couple jars of your drink — the boozy kind.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_scafandr_ignat_3"><text>So they can drink and eat at the same time. That's right. And what are they offering?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_scafandr_ignat_4"><text>They're not offering anything — it's kind of a trial run. What do you want? I mean payment.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_scafandr_proha_4"><text>The bros say, and I've heard myself, that your stuff hits harder than their bootleg. So, can we make a deal?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_scafandr_proha_5"><text>Hmm... maybe we can, if you do a job. Over in the Swamps, the scientists' quartermaster is peddling three-liter jars.

<string id="sidor_scafandr_done_2"><text>That bandit of yours is only good for eatin' and boozin'. Seemed to me he doesn't know squat. Says Borov hid the common stash real safe.

<string id="voron_colt_start_0"><text>Raven, I need a revolver, called the "Raging Bull". Can you get one?</text></string>
<string id="voron_colt_start_1"><text>Let's assume I can. But I'll ask you to get something for me in return. I've received a rather specific order, so I'm actually looking for someone to handle it.</text></string>
<string id="voron_colt_start_2"><text>The phrase "specific order" makes me uneasy. I'd like to hear the details first.</text></string>
<string id="voron_colt_start_3"><text>There's a client from abroad. I think he's a bit nuts, but he pays well, so I try to fulfill his orders when possible. I don't know, maybe he's a taxidermist or something like that, but he's interested in mutant body parts and internal organs. Even ones that don't seem to have any special properties, or that the nerds pay peanuts for because they've been studied for ages. Whether he makes stuffed trophies out of them or tosses them into soup — I couldn't care less. This time he asked for a fracture's spleen. Ever heard of those freaks?</text></string>
<string id="voron_colt_start_41"><text>Doesn't ring a bell. Who are they?</text></string>
<string id="voron_colt_start_42"><text>Yeah. Even took part in a hunt for a fracture pack leader once, actually.</text></string>
<string id="voron_colt_start_51"><text>From a distance, they can be mistaken for a human, just badly hunched over. One arm is much longer than the other — they lean on it when walking. That same arm is what they use to smash their opponents. And they hit so hard no heavyweight boxer could dream of it. Extremely tough. Poorly affected by small-caliber rounds. Fractures almost never appear in the south of the Zone, but just the other day I was told that a group of these mutants was spotted in the southwest of Agroprom, somewhere near the border with the Swamps. Your task is to cut out the spleen from one of them and get back to me fast. I've already prepared the formalin.</text></string>

<string id="voron_colt_start_6"><text>Formalin? What for? And what's the rush?</text></string>
<string id="voron_colt_start_7"><text>Ah, so you don't know about that quirk... Fractures' internal organs start rotting very quickly once the host is killed. Literally a day, sometimes a bit more — and all the guts turn into a foul, stinking sludge. That's what the "preservative" is for.\nSo, what do you say? You taking it on, or should I assign it to my guys, even though they're not too eager?</text></string>

<string id="saharov_controler_start_1"><text>You see, Marked One, after you disabled that ill-fated installation, we decided to send a research group onto the plant grounds. At the moment, the emitter is operating in a safe mode, but another problem has arisen... A controller was spotted in the central building, where the entrance to the underground laboratory is located. Alas, among my colleagues there are no brave souls like yourself. They cannot handle such a dangerous opponent, and they do not wish to try... which I understand. Could you somehow resolve this problem? Not for free, of course.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_controler_start_2"><text>What about Duty, the military... You have an agreement with them.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_controler_start_3"><text>That is true. They agreed to guard only our bunker and the surrounding area, but after one unfortunate incident they categorically refuse to go to the plant. So, will you help science? As a reward I can offer a very good suit. This particular specimen was developed at a research institute and has been tested under the most extreme conditions.</text></string>

Your assistants can safely go there and do their work. I think they can handle a couple of snorks on their own.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_controler_done_3"><text>Ah, that. Well then — thank you, that's one less headache. I believe I promised you an experimental suit. Or did I forget something again?</text></string>

Maybe he went on a bender... If you're in the Gut, walk around, ask the hunters if anyone's seen Vasya. He's got a distinctive gun too — a TOZ, side-by-side, sixty-six. Not many people have those. Check a few houses... buildings, just in case. Maybe you'll manage to find a trail.</text></string>

One "hero" from the local youngsters decided to poke around it the other day. Someone filled his head with the idea that artifacts are drawn to large metal objects. Funny thing is, he actually did find some kind of art nearby. But the fool didn't know the radiation near that truck is heavy, and he didn't have a counter on him. Long story short, he managed to grab the art and stash it in his backpack, then suddenly felt real bad—barely crawled out of the radioactive hotspot. Lucky for him, a couple of experienced stalkers were coming back from a run, hauling loot to Sid. They spotted the kid, jabbed him with anti-rad, and dragged him to the village. Now to the point: the rookie ditched the backpack with the artifact right there by the truck, thinking it was what made him sick. If you get it, it's yours—no change needed. And don't forget to stock up on anti-rads from Sidorovich.</text></string>

That's where you go. A path starts there — after a couple of kilometers it'll lead you to the Southern Farmstead. From there, head west, past the old church, by the guard tower, to the next farmstead. After that you'll either find your way yourself or ask the local old-timers.</text></string>
<string id="ivan_cs_dialog_done_6"><text>Alright, I'll try to find it.</text></string>
<!-- ðóæüå Îðåõà -->
<string id="ivan_toz34m_dialog_start_0"><text>Ivan, I wanted to ask you about your shotgun.</text></string>
<string id="ivan_toz34m_dialog_start_1"><text>You like it? I do too... I traded for it from some stalker over at the Garbage. Had a few artifacts on me, so I went for it. Solid little piece, handy against all kinds of critters. So what's your interest?</text></string>
<string id="ivan_toz34m_dialog_start_2"><text>I'll be honest — I've been promised some very important information for that shotgun. Maybe we can strike a deal?</text></string>
<string id="ivan_toz34m_dialog_start_3"><text>You want to bargain for it?</text></string>
<string id="ivan_toz34m_dialog_start_4"><text>If you don't ask for too much... I won't say no.</text></string>
<string id="ivan_toz34m_dialog_start_5"><text>Hmm... I won't try to cash in. I paid artifacts for it myself. Let's do it this way: you give me a couple of good artifacts, second-tier ones, and I'll hand over this piece to you in good faith. And I'll need a weapon in return too. Get me a rifle — a proper one — chambered for 7.62! I blew all my loot on booze, had a hell of a time celebrating here with the guys. So what do you say? Deal?</text></string>
<string id="ivan_toz34m_dialog_start_61"><text>Well then... we have a deal. Take the artifacts and the rifle.</text></string>
<string id="ivan_toz34m_dialog_start_62"><text>I don't have them on me yet, I'll bring them soon.</text></string>
<string id="ivan_toz34m_dialog_start_7"><text>Excellent! Take it...</text></string>

<string id="tex_ivan_toz"><text>Ivan Sky promises to hand over the shotgun that belonged to Nut, a gopnik from the Garbage, in exchange for two second-tier artifacts and a rifle chambered for 7.62 caliber ammo.</text></string>

<string id="ivan_toz34m_dialog_done_0"><text>Ivan, I'm here about your shotgun.</text></string>
<string id="ivan_toz34m_dialog_done_1"><text>Didn't we already agree on everything? Two second-tier artifacts plus a good assault rifle, and you become the owner of this marvel.</text></string>
<string id="ivan_toz34m_dialog_done_21"><text>Yeah, I remember, I remember. Here are the artifacts and the assault rifle.</text></string>
<string id="ivan_toz34m_dialog_done_22"><text>I don't have them on me yet, I'll bring them soon.</text></string>

<string id="ivan_lim_dialog_2"><text>Found the road to the center of the Zone, or what? Care to share?</text></string>

<!-- new_case_blokpost -->
<string id="sidor_bp_case_have_dlg_0"><text>I'm here about the briefcase with the kompromat.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_have_dlg_11"><text>You found a similar case?! No way!</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_have_dlg_12"><text>You took your sweet time, my friend. That little case has sailed. Now I'll have to keep the capital bigwigs happy. You know what their appetites are like?!</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_have_dlg_21"><text>Your call.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_have_dlg_22"><text>Sidorovich, quit whining, you won't go broke. I'm giving you the briefcase. Might come in handy again.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_have_dlg_31"><text>Looks like the same one. Excellent... We should see this through to the end. I'll give Kuznetsov a call, he'll arrange a courier on the spot. You come up to their barracks at night, from the fence side. Where the concrete slabs are.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_have_dlg_32"><text>I was really counting on you, Marked One, by the way.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_have_dlg_4"><text>Can you be more specific?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_have_dlg_5"><text>Alright, listen carefully: if you look at the checkpoint from the road, there's an APC with thermal vision standing right in the middle — best stay clear of that. But you can slip through on the left side. Stick as close to the barbed wire as you can, there's a gap near a fallen tree. Climb through it and you'll see a fence on the right, a guard tower with a sentry. Where the fence ends, there are several concrete slabs piled up — that's where a soldier will be waiting for you once it gets properly dark. You'll make the exchange right there.\nBring the briefcase straight to me... Come by in the morning, I'm not young enough to lose sleep over this. And Marked One — please, don't make any noise.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_have_dlg_6"><text>There's the question of compensation. That case didn't come cheap for me. I'd like to be reimbursed.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_have_dlg_7"><text>We'll settle up later. Grab some vodka for the soldier and get moving.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_0"><text>Brought the briefcase with the kompromat.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_1"><text>Well done! Everything go quietly?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_2"><text>Smooth as butter... Met up, had a drink, grabbed a bite, talked about life, then went our separate ways. Take the briefcase.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_3"><text>You really did me a favor, Marked One. Though of course you can't live on "thanks" alone. So here — take ten... no, eight thousand tugriks, and we're square!\nLet's see what we've got here... Well, well... A tricky little lock... Aha!\nHere's what's shaping up... According to my information, besides the kompromat, this case also contains some documents about the military's dealings in the Zone and all that. The Barkeep has a sharp lad who can crack this briefcase open. Take this box to him. Looks like we'll get some useful information out of it. You might get something out of it too. You in?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_4"><text>Sidorovich, I thought we were talking about your godfather. Remember?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_5"><text>Ah! Right, of course! Alright, listen up. My godfather, Mikhalych, settled down in an abandoned town — Limansk. According to him, there's an installation there that might be clearing people's minds. That's what one smart guy told him, anyway. Bottom line — when you get to Limansk, you'll talk it over on the spot. Give him my regards.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_6"><text>Limansk? Where's that?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_7"><text>A small town just beyond the Red Forest. I've never been there myself. Stalkers say there's a direct route, through the Army Warehouses. Though mercenaries have settled in there now. Ask them about it... As they say, the tongue will get you where you need to go. Got it?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_8"><text>I think I got it.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_9"><text>So what do you say? Shall we come to an agreement about the box? Will you take it?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_10"><text>Sidorovich, you said it yourself — you scratch my back, I scratch yours. Or what?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_11"><text>Ah! By the way!\nWhy didn't I suggest this right away. There's a nerd working in the Swamps, nearby. Once, after a bit of this and that, he bragged that he could dig up a dossier on anyone here in the Zone. Claims he's got connections in the authorities.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_12"><text>I don't get it — what does that have to do with me?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_13"><text>Looks like you really smacked your head good and hard. I'll spell it out for the especially gifted:\nFingerprints can tell you who you are! Come on, think. If you're in their database, you'll get a hint about your name and why you came into the Zone. Got it or not?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_14"><text>Now I get it. Who's this nerd, and where exactly?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_15"><text>There's a small military post on the southern edge of the Swamps. Almost at the Zone's border. That's where the nerd hangs around. Studying something along his nerdy line. You'll find him if you want to.\nSo, are you taking the briefcase to the Bar?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_16"><text>Alright, I'll take it.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_done_dlg_17"><text>Just don't lose it.</text></string>
<!-- Tesla -->
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_start_0"><text>Sidorovich, did you call for me again?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_start_1"><text>Oh, Marked One! You were looking for a stalker by the nickname Ghost, right? Found him or what?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_start_2"><text>No, not yet. Why?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_start_3"><text>Hmm, well, here's the deal. A mutual acquaintance of ours, Kuznetsov, tossed me an idea on how to smooth things over with the new battalion commander.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_start_4"><text>So you want to fix your problems at someone else's expense? Enough already, stop trying to ride on my back.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_start_5"><text>You listen first and don't interrupt. So... About a month ago, maybe more, that same Ghost volunteered to escort a group of scientists and the soldiers guarding them to some northern point in the Zone. The group vanished. Never checked in. No news since. The current battalion commander decided to organize a search. Looks like he got chewed out from above if he's finally moving. But you understand — charging blindly deep into the Zone, and with unprepared troops at that, means losing them and getting yourself killed too. Those damn soldiers only know how to shout "Attention!" and "At ease!". For raids like that, you need experience.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_start_6"><text>Get to the point already.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_start_7"><text>You're an experienced stalker. Need supplies, proper gear? Yeah? And you want to find Ghost too... Whether you find that group or not is secondary. What matters is you'll learn something about Ghost, and at the same time we'll do the battalion commander a favor by agreeing to look for those people. And if you do find any traces, you'll earn respect and gratitude from all sides. You get it?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_start_81"><text>If the army can't handle it, how am I supposed to help? Let them deal with it themselves.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_start_82"><text>What do you need from me?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_start_91"><text>Then we'll look for someone else.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_start_92"><text>I told the commander that there's an experienced guide who can track down the group's trail. You need to go to the checkpoint. You'll find the deputy battalion commander there and talk it over with him. Just don't show off your weapons there, you know how it is. I'll warn the guys, sure, but soldiers are jumpy — they might open fire if they see your arsenal. And don't go there late at night either, they'll shoot first and won't ask your name. Once you sort things out with him, come back to me. Tell me how it went. Off you go.</text></string>

<string id="escape_trader_tesla_have_0"><text>I talked to the battalion commander.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_have_1"><text>How did they receive you?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_have_2"><text>Everything's fine. He gave me some gear, food, medicine, and sent me off to the middle of nowhere... I need to go to Limansk, to your godfather, Mikhalych.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_have_31"><text>That's not close... But you're used to it. You're a seasoned guy, go on.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_have_32"><text>Since when did that old geezer start getting along with the military? What a sly one. Well then, since you're heading that way, maybe you could pass a little gift to my godfather? As a favor, so to speak.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_have_4"><text>No idea about contacts — you sort that out yourselves. And if it's anything heavy, I'm not carrying it. I've already got a ton of gear to haul. The road there isn't short.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_have_5"><text>You're a seasoned guy, you'll manage. And you won't have to strain yourself either. Remember that container with the artifact you brought me? The one Butterfingers lost. There was a special artifact in it. And my godfather's a bit... obsessed with that sort of thing. Do the man a favor, pass the artifact along to him. Who knows, maybe something will come your way too.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_have_61"><text>Decided to grease your godfather's palm? Alright, but without the container. I've got my own.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_have_62"><text>Your godfather will manage without a gift... Crafty bastard.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_have_71"><text>Suit yourself, take it. I'll let Mikhalych know to expect a courier.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_have_72"><text>Your loss.</text></string>
<string id="tex_lim_trader_bauble"><text>Sidorovich asked me to deliver a rare artifact as a gift to Mikhalych. Something should come of it.</text></string>

<string id="escape_trader_tesla_done_0"><text>Let the battalion commander know there's news for him.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_done_1"><text>Maybe I should snap to attention too? Not even a hello or a please. Look at you, found yourself a commander already. Five minutes talking to soldiers and you've picked up their habits... Or maybe you're one of them, military? Why not? You've got the posture, you shoot well, and all that other stuff. Mug like a seasoned soldier fits you just fine. Even your voice has changed. Maybe you really are military, or from some similar outfit. What's got you thinking?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_done_2"><text>I don't remember... But that's not what this is about right now. Please inform the battalion commander.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_done_3"><text>It's better when a man shows some respect. Did you at least find out what they were interested in?</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_done_4"><text>I did, I did... I'd rather not spread it around. It concerns the missing expedition. I need to meet with him.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_tesla_done_5"><text>Then get moving to the checkpoint, they're waiting for you. Asked about you five times a day. Just don't rattle your weapons, I remind you.</text></string>
<!-- amk_af_night_star -->
<string id="lim_trader_bauble_0"><text>Mikhailych, there's a little present for you, from your godfather.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_bauble_1"><text>From Sidor?! And what is it, a pood of sea salt?</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_bauble_2"><text>Why salt of all things? He sent an artifact. Said you're really into them... you know.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_bauble_3"><text>An artifact is good. But salt wouldn't hurt either. Wanted to take a bath, warm up my bones. They say it helps you relax. Heart, blood vessels, nervous system — everything's at the limit.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_bauble_4"><text>You even have a bathtub here? Some people sure live well...</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_bauble_5"><text>I'm joking, but still — you want to live like a proper person. So what did he send?</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_bauble_6"><text>Said it's a very rare... specimen.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_bauble_7"><text>Don't make things up. Sidor's never known words like that. But it's a nice trinket... When you see that old rat, give him my thanks. And this is for you — for cheering up an old man.</text></string>

<string id="borov_zaval_no_dialog_4"><text>I get it... I'll try to compensate you as best I can.</text></string>
<string id="borov_zaval_no_dialog_51"><text>Compensate, you say? And what am I supposed to tell the brotherhood — that they're busting their backs for some random schmuck? And how do you think they'll look at me after that? I do business with you 'cause it don't break our code. But the boys ain't gonna slave "for some uncle." That's not our suit.

<string id="borov_zaval_no_dialog_52"><text>Compensate, you say? And what was all that shooting about, huh? Some guy came running to me with his eyes popping out... You didn't happen to lay some crooks out at the factory, did you? Alright, I'll smooth it over. Those lads figured they could live without Papa Borov, by their own rules. Serves 'em right! But I'm not giving you my people to clear that blockage. Today you're "compensating" some, tomorrow you'll go after mine, huh? Bottom line — I'm closing my eyes to this little "incident," but not a single crew is gonna help you with that blockage. Clear it yourself or find someone else. There's plenty of different folks roaming around here. Got it?</text></string>
<string id="borov_zaval_no_dialog_61"><text>I got it. Only thing is, your people settled in at the factory. If I find someone, how's that gonna work?</text></string>
<string id="borov_zaval_no_dialog_71"><text>Mine, yeah — but not mine anymore. Those lads figured they could live without Papa Borov. Wanted freedom.

<string id="borov_zaval_yes_dialog_21"><text>I checked the entrance to the underground. There's a blockage, sure, but it's not that solid — could be cleared in half a day if there were helpers. You wouldn't send your boys on the job, would you? I'd compensate somehow...</text></string>
<string id="borov_zaval_yes_dialog_22"><text>I actually wanted to ask about your night scares. Still bothering you?</text></string>
<string id="borov_zaval_yes_dialog_31"><text>Compensate, huh... It ain't really kosher for drifters to sweat like regular laborers, but... alright, let's do it this way. You, Marked One, you're a straight-up kid, show respect to the brotherhood, helped sort out our messes too. Help us deal with one more bit of trouble, and I'll give the word for the punks to get busy with your job.</text></string>
<string id="borov_zaval_yes_dialog_32"><text>You could say that. Half the deck's already pushing weight during the day, and keeping watch at night. Some folks are stirring the pot, saying we should bail from here. We've got one trump hideout far up north, as a backup. If things get real bad, we'll have to haul ass there.</text></string>

<string id="borov_zaval_yes_dialog_42"><text>Yeah, you're really pressed. I've thought it over, I'll try to help. So it all happens at night, huh? Gotta admit, my knees are already knocking, but curiosity's got the better of me. Let's see what kind of glowing ball's taken up behind the gas station.</text></string>
<string id="borov_zaval_yes_dialog_5"><text>Some crap's gotten into the habit of flying around at night behind the gas station. Looks like a glowing ball, kind of translucent. And sometimes a flame just flares up in the middle of the clearing, all by itself. The boys on watch are totally on edge — say this dread just rolls over you, chills you right to the tailbone. And they ain't bullshitting, looks like. I've been sleeping like crap myself, seeing all kinds of stuff half-asleep. And Veiny was yapping the other day that he heard voices around midnight... Devilry, basically. You stalkers are used to this kinda voodoo. You'll take a look, yeah? See what's there? Think you can wipe this filth out or chase it off? My goons'll clear your blockage in no time then.</text></string>
<string id="borov_zaval_yes_dialog_61"><text>At night, huh? My knees are already knocking, but curiosity's getting the better of me. Alright, let's see what kind of glowing ball it is.</text></string>
<string id="borov_zaval_yes_dialog_62"><text>I'm not ready to jump in right away. Need to think it through.</text></string>
<string id="tex_borov_zaval_article"><text>I made a deal with Borov that he would send his people to clear the blockage at the entrance to X-18 if I helped rid his gang of the strange entities that fly around near their base at night and terrify its inhabitants.</text></string>

<string id="borov_zaval_done_dialog_0"><text>You can sleep easy again, I took care of your night nightmares.</text></string>
<string id="borov_zaval_done_dialog_1"><text>Yeah? Fo' real? Damn, nice work! So what was it? What kinda balls?</text></string>
<string id="borov_zaval_done_dialog_2"><text>Those mysterious balls turned out to be... well, just another of the Zone's spawn, nothing special.</text></string>
<string id="borov_zaval_done_dialog_3"><text>Would you look at that! "Nothing special," he says! Alright then, you're tight with our brotherhood now, which means it ain't beneath the boys to play regular workhorses for once. I'll send a construction crew to the factory right away, and I'll drop you a note when they're done.\nBy the way! I figure this is something useful for you to know. Word came in from some punks who dropped by Mongol to throw bones. They were planning to crawl into some underground too, but it didn't pan out for 'em at first. Supposedly, in those labs, before they bolted, the eggheads pumped in some hardcore gas. Without special suits with a closed breathing cycle, there's jack shit to do in there. Keep that in mind.</text></string>

<!-- new_kvest -->
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_0"><text>I received your message, Professor. What did you want?</text></string> 
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_1"><text>Marked One, I am glad to see you in good health. Do you remember our conversation about the scientist you found on Radar?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_2"><text>The one who survived the helicopter crash? Prikhodko, if I remember his name correctly?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_3"><text>Yes, yes. You see, that time I was not completely frank with you. In fact, a total of five helicopters were involved in that operation. One of them carried Prikhodko's group, the others had personnel from a departmental institute and the military. Our curators insisted on mandatory scientific support for this mission, and we could not refuse. They also took full responsibility for the financial and technical provision of the expedition. As you already know, it failed. Not a single chopper returned to base. Moreover, the fate of three helicopters is still not known for certain. Indirect evidence suggests that they made emergency landings at different points in the Zone. All passengers and crew members, except for Prikhodko, are listed as missing, but to be honest, they most likely perished. The higher-ups did not raise much of a fuss until I recently informed them about the survivor you discovered.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_4"><text>I don't understand what you're getting at.</text></string> 
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_5"><text>It appears that the leadership initially deemed it impractical to allocate resources for a search operation, however your success convinced them otherwise. Now they demand that I organize additional searches, since, in their opinion, I have already managed to assemble such a qualified operative for the Radar mission. That is, of course, you, Marked One. First of all, I wanted to involve General Voronin's fighters, as we quite often cooperate with his group. However, it proved impossible to contact him through the old channels and, as it turned out later, there is no longer any point in doing so. I honestly do not know whom else to turn to. I need reliable, proven, experienced people; the matter is delicate. Broadening the circle of those in the know is highly undesirable. At the same time, the management is putting pressure on me daily, threatening to cut funding for my project if I take no action. And that would mean the complete collapse of my scientific career.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_6"><text>Let's not beat around the bush, Professor. You want me to take care of this?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_7"><text>You understood correctly! Your skills have allowed you to reach such corners of the Zone that other stalkers can only dream of visiting.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_8"><text>Better they keep dreaming than get eaten by monsters or torn to shreds by an anomaly. Or worse — join those mumbling wretches wandering around Radar.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_9"><text>What I mean, Marked One, is that your knowledge and your ability to penetrate the most hidden places of the Zone give you a high chance of completing this mission without any particular... complications.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_10"><text>Oh, you've really wrapped it up nicely, Professor... Just say it outright — you don't really care what happens to me. Who am I to you? Just another stalker, a bit luckier than the rest. If not me, you'll find another, a third...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_11"><text>Marked One, why so harsh? I hold you in very high regard. And I turned to you because I am confident in your integrity. You are better suited for this task than anyone else. Think about my words. Only, if possible, I would like to receive your answer no later than within a day, otherwise I will have to look for another... contractor. Please understand my position: too much is at stake for me.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_12"><text>Maybe I'm not right... I'll think about it.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_2_0"><text>Professor, I've thought over your proposal.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_2_1"><text>Do you agree?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_2_21"><text>I agree, but first I'd like to discuss the terms.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_2_22"><text>No, I don't want to risk it unnecessarily.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_2_3"><text>As I understand it, first and foremost you want to know the size of the reward? Well, that is perfectly businesslike, in the spirit of the times, so to speak. In that case, make your own proposal. I will try, as far as possible, to satisfy your demands.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_2_4"><text>I am interested in modificates transformed from artifacts of the "Dummy" class. The methods of obtaining them, to be precise. I think it would be fair if I rummaged through your database and chose the recipe I need myself, from the categories up to and including absolutes. If nothing suitable turns up, then so be it — I am willing to accept payment in foreign currency. I believe two thousand dollars in bearer's checks would be equivalent to a rare recipe, wouldn't you agree? And you will also reimburse the consumables I spend during the upcoming mission. Does that work?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_2_5"><text>The terms are accepted. Then let us not waste any more time and proceed straight to business.\nUnfortunately, I do not have precise reference points for the search, as I already mentioned, but approximate areas have nevertheless been established. One helicopter should be located in the southern part of the Swamps, the second in the eastern part of the Tesla Zone, the third in the north of the Ivankovsky District Center. In addition to determining the exact coordinates of the helicopters, you will need to inspect them for the presence of "black boxes," which recorded not only the data of the helicopters' flight systems, but also the readings of other scientific equipment installed on each of them. There may be extremely valuable information there. I propose starting with the Swamps. And please do not delay, I ask you. I am expected to provide a report to the higher authorities.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_crash_vertolet_2_6"><text>They've waited this long, they can wait a bit more. Alright, alright, I got it. I'll try to handle it as soon as possible.</text></string>
<string id="tex_marsh_crash_vertolet"><text>Sakharov needs the "black box" from the helicopter in the Swamps.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_marsh_crash_vertolet_0"><text>I managed to locate the helicopter in the Swamps and retrieve the "black box" from it.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_marsh_crash_vertolet_1"><text>Then please hand it over at once. And send the coordinates to my tablet.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_marsh_crash_vertolet_2"><text>Yes, of course. Here you go.</text></string> 
<string id="sakharov_marsh_crash_vertolet_3"><text>This is exactly what we need, judging by the markings. It was not in vain that I entrusted you with this task, Marked One. I will now credit your account so that you can replenish your stock of consumables, as we agreed. You will be able to choose what you need from our exchange fund yourself.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_marsh_crash_vertolet_4"><text>Yeah, certainly. Where to next? To the Tesla Zone?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_marsh_crash_vertolet_5"><text>Do not rush. I would like you to head to the Dark Valley first. Another helicopter crashed there recently as well. Although this incident is unrelated to the Radar expedition, it occurred to me that the authorities would not mind digging into the flight recorder of that aircraft too. The crash site coordinates are known to us. It is south of the old factory, in the hilly terrain lying east of the large swamp.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_marsh_crash_vertolet_6"><text>What? The deal was to search for three helicopters! That's not how business is done!</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_marsh_crash_vertolet_7"><text>An extra "black box" will serve as a sort of bonus for the armchair intellectuals. For you, however, the bonus will be any, as you put it, artifact creation recipe from the line commonly referred to as "unique." So, does that motivate you to take a little detour?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_marsh_crash_vertolet_8"><text>You are quite the adventurer, Professor... Very well, then here is a countercondition: if there is no suitable recipe in your database, I will take an additional thousand dollars from you in a bearer's check. Get it however you like. And I am heading to the Dark Valley. We'll see if anything can be extracted from that helicopter.</text></string>
<string id="tex_dar_crash_vertolet"><text>Sakharov needs the "black box" from the helicopter in the Dark Valley.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_0"><text>I managed to retrieve the "black box" from the helicopter in the Dark Valley.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_1"><text>Then please hand it over at once.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_2"><text>Here you go. It's in decent shape. You can even make out the letters and numbers.</text></string> 
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_3"><text>Very good. I had concerns that the recorder might be badly damaged. I will now credit your account so that you can replenish your stock of consumables, as we agreed. And now, regarding your reward. Please, choose a recipe.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_41"><text>I am interested in this one — "Battery" from "Snow".</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_42"><text>I am interested in this one — "Jumper" from "Springboard".</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_43"><text>I am interested in this one — "Electro-Beads" from "Snow".</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_44"><text>I am interested in this one — "Spray Can" from "Witch's Jelly".</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_45"><text>I am interested in this one — "Airship" from "Snow".</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_46"><text>I am interested in this one — "Eye" from "Snow".</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_47"><text>I am interested in this one — "Gorgon Jellyfish" from "Witch's Jelly".</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_48"><text>I don't see anything suitable here. Let's have the check, as agreed.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_51"><text>Please provide the communication code of your PDA so that I can send you the information you are interested in.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_52"><text>Here you are. I had to pay for its processing out of my own savings. You see how much I value our cooperation?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_5"><text>Uh... and where do I look at that?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_6"><text>Let me do everything myself. Done. Please note, you are the only stalker to whom I have ever granted access to our database of artifact transmutation transformations. You see how much I value our cooperation?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_7"><text>Deeply touched. Let's move on. Now it's the Tesla Zone for me, as I understand it? A nasty place, I must say.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_8"><text>I have no doubt about your words. But since you have been there before and returned alive, I dare hope that luck will accompany you this time as well.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_9"><text>Professor, do you have any idea what happened there in that "Tesla" Zone? The ground looks as if it was turned inside out. Something burst out from underground there — but what?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_10"><text>The events that took place there are unknown to me. Attempts by research groups to penetrate the area generally ended in failure. You yourself say it — a dreadful place.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dar_crash_vertolet_11"><text>That's true. Alright then, no point in dragging this out any longer... I'm off.</text></string>
<string id="tex_gen_crash_vertolet"><text>Sakharov needs the "black box" from the helicopter in the Tesla Zone.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_gen_crash_vertolet_0"><text>I managed to locate the helicopter in the Tesla Zone and retrieve the "black box" from it.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_gen_crash_vertolet_1"><text>Then please hand it over at once. And send the coordinates to my tablet.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_gen_crash_vertolet_2"><text>Yes, of course. Here you go.</text></string> 
<string id="sakharov_gen_crash_vertolet_3"><text>This is exactly what we need, judging by the markings. It was not in vain that I entrusted you with this task, Marked One. I will now credit your account so that you can replenish your stock of consumables, as we agreed.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_gen_crash_vertolet_4"><text>The last one is in the district center, right? No more unpleasant surprises, I hope?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_gen_crash_vertolet_5"><text>That is correct, this is the final stage of the mission.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_gen_crash_vertolet_6"><text>Listen, Professor, why were they scattered all over the Zone in the first place? According to your story, they were flying to a single point.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_gen_crash_vertolet_7"><text>I would very much like to know the answer to that question myself. I hope the "black boxes" you found will shed some light on this mystery.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_gen_crash_vertolet_8"><text>Then I'm off to the district center. I'd like to wrap all this up as soon as possible.</text></string>
<string id="tex_dead_crash_vertolet"><text>Sakharov needs the "black box" from the helicopter in the Ivankovsky District Center.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_0"><text>I managed to locate the helicopter in the Ivankovsky District Center and retrieve the "black box" from it.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_1"><text>Then please hand it over at once. And send the coordinates to my tablet.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_2"><text>Yes, of course. Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_3"><text>Excellent! You handled this extremely difficult task masterfully, Marked One. I will now credit your account so that you can replenish your stock of consumables, as we agreed. Now please, choose your reward.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_41"><text>Let's take a look at the modificate recipes.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_55"><text>Nothing. Let's return to the category list.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_56"><text>No, none of this works for me. Professor, I think I'd rather take the money.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_61"><text>Are you absolutely certain?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_62"><text>As you wish. On such an occasion, I do not mind paying out of my own pocket. Thank you very much, Marked One!</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_71"><text>Yes.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_72"><text>No, let's return to the category list.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_81"><text>The information has been sent. Thank you very much, Marked One!</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_82"><text>Choose.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_9"><text>I still have a few questions...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_10"><text>Forgive me, Marked One, but all questions later. I must attend to the transfer of the flight recorders. There are other urgent matters as well. No offense, but we will talk another time.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_dead_crash_vertolet_11"><text>I understand... not saying goodbye.</text></string>

<string id="tex_saharov_scientist_rf"><text>\nSakharov asks you to clarify the fate of the scientific reconnaissance group in the Red Forest. You should search in the old mine working near the entrance to the reserve.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_scientist_red_forest_0"><text>I found traces of your group in the Red Forest.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_scientist_red_forest_1"><text>As I understand it, no one survived?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_scientist_red_forest_2"><text>That's right. Who even advised them to set up a base in that place? It's a nest of snorks and poltergeists. Those creatures, as I've noticed, are very fond of such spots.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_scientist_red_forest_3"><text>Regrettable... lately we have been losing our colleagues far too often. Well then, thank you for clearing things up. Please accept medical kits and a small sum credited to your personal account as a token of gratitude. It should help you out.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_scientist_red_forest_4"><text>Contact me if you need to find someone else. I'll help however I can.</text></string>

<string id="tex_semenov_green_art"><text>\nSemyonov asks you to find an "emerald" artifact for him. He promises a good reward.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_start_0"><text>Listen, have you heard about "emerald" artifacts?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_start_1"><text>Ha... not only have I heard of them, I've even held them in my hands. Ghost brought a few from somewhere. That was back when he and Vasilyev were getting ready to search for the entrance to an underground laboratory.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_start_2"><text>Did he say where he got them?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_start_3"><text>No. He's not a talkative type. These "emeralds" are very rare in their own right. Their properties are poorly studied. Whether the Zone produces them or they are the result of artificial transformation, I cannot say for sure. Ask around at the Bar, talk to Tooth. He has all kinds of information. Maybe he knows something about the "emeralds" too.\nIf you happen to come across such an artifact, bring it to me. I promise a very good reward.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_start_4"><text>That's for later... Here in the Gut, I spoke with one of yours — Petrov was his name. According to him, three "emerald" artifacts assembled together can move a person somewhere downward, by several meters. It's just not clear how... What do you think about that?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_start_5"><text>What am I supposed to think? The Zone — that says it all. Who really knows anything about it for certain? Teleportation here is, you could say, a fairly ordinary phenomenon. Just recall the Bungees. So go ahead and try it, why not?! Just before experimenting, make sure there's some space below you, and not just solid earth. Otherwise you might end up burying yourself alive.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_start_6"><text>Yeah... It's clear that nothing is clear. I'll think about your proposal regarding the "emerald."</text></string>

<string id="semenov_green_art_done_0"><text>I managed to find an "emerald" artifact.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_done_1"><text>Whoa! Will you donate it to science… I mean, trade it?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_done_2"><text>You said this artifact is very rare. What can you offer for it?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_done_3"><text>I have a recipe for one modificate, it's called "Porcupine". There's also some information about a stash with artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_done_4"><text>What kind of stash? And what artifacts are there?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_done_5"><text>When Ghost was scouting a route to the laboratory, he complained that he blundered onto the factory grounds at a bad moment. A whole pack of snorks came out of nowhere. He had to leave part of his gear and a container with artifacts there. Had to make his escape light.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_done_6"><text>A container, you say? Wouldn't it be the one with the "emeralds"? Although… how did they get into the laboratory then, if the artifacts were left at the factory?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_done_7"><text>That's a big question — where they ended up. No one has seen Vasilyev or Ghost since then. He left the "emeralds" here before the reconnaissance, and those artifacts were meant for Sakharov as trade goods. Ghost always had very fine specimens. Stalkers rarely bring in ones like that. In the end, he had to take some of his gear on credit, since the artifacts stayed at the factory.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_done_81"><text>Artifacts come and go. Better hand over the recipe.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_done_82"><text>So where should I look for that container?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_done_91"><text>Then write it down, it makes a very good modificate.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_green_art_done_92"><text>Ghost said that by the far wall, on the right if you're facing in from the entrance, there's a green construction trailer. That's where he left it.\nIt's probably still lying there. After that incident, as far as I know, no one dared to poke around the factory grounds.</text></string>

<string id="proha_samogon_start_0"><text>About your moonshine.</text></string>
<string id="proha_samogon_start_1"><text>Ah, it's you, Marked One. There's moonshine, but no containers. Bring me five empty jars and you'll get one cherished full one. Heh-heh.</text></string>
<string id="proha_samogon_start_21"><text>Five jars… That was the deal.</text></string>
<string id="proha_samogon_start_22"><text>And where am I supposed to find them? There's no glass factory around here.</text></string>
<string id="proha_samogon_start_32"><text>Ever heard about the eggheads in the Swamps? Through their quartermaster — Pakhom, that's his nickname — you can get all kinds of things.</text></string>
<string id="proha_samogon_start_42"><text>Those Swamps are a long way off…</text></string>

<string id="proha_samogon_done_0"><text>Prokha, I brought the containers, five of them, just like we agreed. Pour it!</text></string>
<string id="proha_samogon_done_1"><text>You're quick. The glassware all intact?</text></string>
<string id="proha_samogon_done_2"><text>Carried them like a maiden, take them.</text></string>
<string id="proha_samogon_done_3"><text>Yeah, intact. And here's your jar. Carry it carefully too, don't spill it.</text></string>
<!-- hunters_toz -->
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_start_dialog_0"><text>I've got a word for you.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_start_dialog_1"><text>Listen, what the hell do you stink of like that? You could at least watch where you step once in a while. Where'd you manage to smear yourself with so much crap? What if the pseudodogs catch the scent? They've got a thing for fleshes, and you reek of them from a mile away. You want something, or just passing through?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_start_dialog_2"><text>Yeah, got myself into it, happens to everyone. When you're running flat out, you don't always notice what kind of crap's under your feet...\nSay, did you buy a shotgun from Baldy?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_start_dialog_3"><text>Hmm, yeah, that did happen. Gave him a "Flash" and a "Meat Chunk" for it. Fair and square. Why the sudden interest? My fragrant friend.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_start_dialog_4"><text>Hey, cool it. Careless words can earn you a solid reply... I've got my own interest in that shotgun.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_start_dialog_5"><text>Don't sulk or you'll burst — or crap your pants again. You've gotta appreciate a joke, otherwise life ain't worth living. As for the shotgun — just between us, it's nothing special, that's why I don't use it. Wasted good artifacts on it, got tempted by the brand name, thought it was from a decent manufacturer. If you really want it, bring back what I lost — and it's yours.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_start_dialog_6"><text>So you specifically need a "Flash" and a "Meat Chunk"?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_start_dialog_7"><text>No, why would I. Any two artifacts of that tier will do. Or one of a higher tier. When you've got them, we'll talk. And you should really clean that crap off your boots — you'll feel calmer yourself, and the air around you will be fresher.</text></string>

<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_done_dialog_0"><text>Our deal still on?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_done_dialog_1"><text>Still interested in the shotgun? Brought the artifacts?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_done_dialog_21"><text>Not yet. Haven't made it to my stash.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_done_dialog_22"><text>Brought a couple of second-tier ones.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_done_dialog_23"><text>I've got a really good artifact. I'm handing it over.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_done_dialog_3"><text>Hmm. That'll do. I stashed that shotgun in a hideout. Not far from the tunnel that leads to the Cordon — I was hiding from boars in a bus on the road. Wrapped that little piece of junk in an old backpack and left it there.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_hunter_toz_done_dialog_4"><text>I'll try to find it. Hope I won't have to come back — to smash your face in.</text></string>
<!-- new_ecolog_mutant -->
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_0"><text>Ivan Sergeyevich said you needed help.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_1"><text>Yes, there's one urgent matter. Do you remember our conversation about the biopsy?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_2"><text>You'd better refresh my memory, I've been having some problems with it.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_3"><text>If you're joking, that's good. We were talking about researching mutant tissues. If you've noticed, among specimens of the same species there have started to appear individuals with more pronounced traits — as stalkers put it, seasoned ones. The Zone is changing, and so are the mutants. They adapt quickly, alter their behavior, and become more resistant to external factors. Some even believe they are beginning to show rudimentary intelligence. The Zone works wonders. The evolutionary process that took millions of years on Earth unfolds here in just a matter of years. Studying the genetic code of these creatures and comparing their DNA to earlier samples will provide yet another irrefutable confirmation of the theory of evolution. And it will be of enormous benefit to other fields of science as well. Our colleagues from the capital institute have taken up this problem.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_4"><text>Then let them deal with it. What does it have to do with me?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_5"><text>I promised that, through my own channels, I would get in touch with the Hunters. They'll help with tracking down rare mutants. But to hunt them themselves they... refuse. Some principles of theirs. And you, Marked One, seem to me the most suitable candidate. Legends are already being told about you.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_6"><text>Let's skip that. What exactly do you need from me?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_7"><text>The Hunters reported where they encountered specific mutants. You'll need to bring me parts of their bodies, and I'll handle the processing and preservation of the material myself. Will you help?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_8"><text>And which mutants will I have to hunt?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_9"><text>Bloodsuckers, chimeras, controllers, pseudogiants. They sit at the top of the food chain, and the biotransformation of these organisms proceeds at a much faster pace than in other species.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_10"><text>That's quite a demand! You said it yourself — seasoned ones. So much for all those hunting principles. This isn't chasing dogs and cats through the swamps.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_11"><text>It's clear that killing them isn't easy, but still...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_12"><text>Exactly — not easy. You'll be advancing science here, and I'll be putting my ass on the line. What's the point for me? What exactly do I get out of it?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_13"><text>I'll compensate you for shotgun ammo and medical supplies. Ivan Sergeyevich allocated some funds for these purposes. I can also share information on the sequential modification of the artifact "Pellicle" into more advanced, let's call them that, specimens. Scientists at our institute are working on this problem, even if it's not their main field of activity. I can say they've achieved certain successes, although with the category often referred to as "absolutes" things aren't working out for them yet. Thus, upon completion of the job, you'll receive practically the entire line of transformations, from modificate to hypermodificate.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_141"><text>Not interested. I'll manage without your modifications.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_142"><text>Deal. The main thing is not to regret it later, if I manage in time.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_151"><text>Well then, I'll look for other volunteers.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_mutant_start_152"><text>Believe me, you won't regret it. We can get started right away.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_bloodsucker_start_3"><text>No, it's not far, in the Dark Valley. Hunters reported seeing a pack of those bastards there. Said they were of some special kind, black. Looks like exactly the ones we need.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_bloodsucker_start_4"><text>And what exactly am I supposed to do?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_bloodsucker_start_5"><text>You need to cut three tentacles off them.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_bloodsucker_start_61"><text>I'll try to bring you the tentacles.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_bloodsucker_start_62"><text>Three?! I don't like this idea. Count me out.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_bloodsucker_start_71"><text>I've sent you a marker to their habitat on your PDA. Take these rounds, you'll get more when you return.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_bloodsucker_done_4"><text>Don't worry, they're the real deal. Take them before they start stinking even more. Nasty creatures, they were.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_bloodsucker_done_5"><text>That's good then... I asked the hunters to pick only seasoned monsters. The DNA we need is found specifically in such specimens.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_bloodsucker_done_7"><text>Here you go, just like I promised.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_bloodsucker_done_8"><text>Hold on! What about the modificate recipe?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_bloodsucker_done_9"><text>We discussed that right at the very beginning. You'll get the recipes once all the work is done, and you've only completed a quarter of it.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_bloodsucker_done_10"><text>You're a crafty one, covering your bases.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_chimera_start_4"><text>What's needed this time?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_chimera_start_5"><text>Five claws from those beasts are needed, I think that'll be enough.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_chimera_start_6"><text>What?! Just cutting one takes a ton of running around. You'll burn through a mountain of ammo.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_chimera_start_7"><text>Then... at least three. I'll try to compensate you for ammo and medicine, and I'll chip in for the road.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_controller_start_6"><text>And how did controllers end up in the Swamps? It was a quiet place... used to be. Dogs barking, boars grunting, tushkanos "murmuring", kitty-cats purring. What's going on... A controller is a dangerous beast, you can't get close to it. You'll need a good rifle, and with optics too.</text></string>

<!-- êîíòðèê, ïîëòåð, ãèãàíò, ïî÷êà ÝÕè -->
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_monster_save_0"><text>I'd like to ask about something.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_monster_save_1"><text>Any problems, or just curious?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_monster_save_2"><text>That mutant stuff I brought in for biopsy, how did you preserve it, what did you treat it with? Parts of rare mutants are valuable goods, but they spoil fast. Sometimes they just disappear before you can even put them to use. Maybe you can advise what needs to be done to keep them longer. Or preserve them for me, if that's possible.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_monster_save_3"><text>Preserving mutant parts is a rather troublesome and labor-intensive process. There's also the issue of the preservative. To stabilize the flesh, we use a substance from the "Fruit Punch" anomaly. Here, in the Swamps, this anomaly does not occur. We made an arrangement with a couple of stalkers, and they supply us with the necessary amount of preservative, but the reserves are limited. No one will just hand it over to me for personal needs. Even our quartermaster, Pakhom, has his rats getting their little crumbs strictly by quota.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_monster_save_4"><text>I'll deal with the preservative, I'll bring as much as needed. Jars are sold by that same Pakhom. You just tell me how many and which parts you're willing to preserve. And how long can they be stored?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_monster_save_5"><text>They can be stored for quite a long time, provided certain conditions are met. As I understand it, you need to preserve the flesh itself, without any prior processing. That, by the way, will take less time. The preparation process for preservation takes about a day, plus time for the preservative to properly soak into the flesh. So count on this - if you bring it in today, you'll only be able to take it back, should the need arise, in two days, no earlier. The technological process must not be interrupted, otherwise you'll be left with nothing. I warn you right away, in a normal environment, without refrigeration and preservative, tissue spoilage will be the same as before treatment, or even faster.\nIf these terms suit you, then I'll talk to Ivan Sergeich, I think he won't be against it, considering your previous merits. And we ourselves might urgently need something from rare parts. You wouldn't refuse us, would you?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_monster_save_6"><text>No, of course not. The terms are acceptable. So how many jars should I bring?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_monster_save_7"><text>One jar is enough to preserve a single part.\nBut in any case, the issue of preservation will have to be handled through our quartermaster. Containers for the preservative, and most importantly the refrigerators, are under his supervision. That's why he's the quartermaster.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_monster_save_8"><text>I'll come to some kind of agreement with Pakhom.</text></string>

<string id="lim_fraer_pripyat_start_3"><text>So that's the layout you're paintin'. Well then, lemme chew on it...\nYeah, got it now... A little shuffle... You bring me a suit, one of them scientific ones, the kind Sakharov's eggheads wear over at Yantar, and I'll give you a tip on a sweet stash. That work for ya? Kinda brotherly, yeah?</text></string>
<string id="lim_fraer_pripyat_start_4"><text>Brotherly?! What'd you promise me? I get you a path — you give me a stash tip. How you get there ain't my problem.</text></string>
<string id="lim_fraer_pripyat_start_5"><text>Marked One, why you raisin' a wave right off the bat? How was I supposed to know about them hassles. I figured if they killed that brain-crusher, you could slip through easy-like.</text></string>
<string id="lim_fraer_pripyat_start_6"><text>You figured. Fraer, that ain't how business works. Either you answer for your talk, or we split and forget this whole thing.</text></string>
<string id="lim_fraer_pripyat_start_7"><text>Man, what a stubborn mug, and God just had to stick me with ya. Fine, I'll toss in a dozen more Pee-Dee-As. And if you bring a suit that's mo-de... mu-de... fa-ci-ri-zed... damn, tongue-breaker! Anyway, that green one, seen it maybe? For that you'll get word on another stash too. Honest, tooth I swear. So what, we settled?</text></string>
<string id="lim_fraer_pripyat_start_8"><text>Swearin' on his tooth, yeah right. You know how many mugs like you already tossed me their teeth? Plus, I don't see your cut in all this.

<string id="lim_fraer_pripyat_start_9"><text>That ain't for your sick head to worry about. What else is there — that's mine business. Got it? See you got it.\nNow listen up. You gotta sort things out with that noggin of yours, right? Everyone knows you're diggin' dirt on Strelok and his sidekicks. So if we come to terms, I won't point you to just any stash, but for real, to that Fang-toothed guy's hidey-hole... Or whatever they called that handy buddy of Strelok. And I can spill about Strelok's own crib in Pripyat. Back in the day some real serious people were stirrin' deals with him, and I bet they still are, just keepin' it quiet. One of ours, Mishka the Tramp, told me once over a heavy drink. He used to guide them types. That's how they sniffed out Strelok's pad. Tramp poisoned himself on rotgut a few days later and croaked, but the info's solid, not drunk crap. I told no one — not even the boss — just you. Outta respect. So what, we dealin'?</text></string>
<string id="lim_fraer_pripyat_start_10"><text>We're dealin'. Even though I'm fed, clothed, and geared just fine, you did hook my interest. Strelok... more and more feels like some kinda myth than a real man. From the stories — he's been everywhere, left his stink everywhere, but nobody really knows squat about him.</text></string>
<string id="lim_fraer_pripyat_start_11"><text>What'd you expect, he's a big-shot, not some riffraff, a seasoned stalker through and through. Truth be told, the whole Strelok thing's fishy. Not many dealt with him and his crew straight up. Those who did are damn hard to find, or keep their mouths shut. And some the Zone swallowed whole. But that he was here and stirred up hell — that's a sure thing. Even now some folks got tails hangin' on 'em, walkin' around, lookin' over their shoulders.</text></string>
<string id="lim_fraer_pripyat_start_12"><text>Alright, I'll try to get you a good suit. I'll send the route anyway. With a life like this, maybe we won't see each other again.</text></string>

<string id="lim_fraer_pripyat_done_0"><text>I brought you the scientific suit, hope the size works.</text></string>
<string id="lim_fraer_pripyat_done_1"><text>Now that's respect, brother, real respect! Always knew I could count on you. Been feelin' it — you're a straight guy, not some flashy bullshitter like most stalkers.</text></string>

Listen close.\nIn Pripyat, on the central square, right across from the monument to "our bright future", there's a cross — can't miss it. Who they buried there, I ain't in the know, but that don't matter. That grave's where Fix stashed his junk. What's in there... even a naked hedgehog knows the loot's gotta be solid, you don't haul booze and grub all the way to Pripyat.</text></string>

<string id="tex_barmen_freeman"><text>\nThe Barkeep asked me to find out about one eccentric foreigner. Supposedly he was heading to the Red Forest through the Wild Territory</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_start_0"><text>Why are you staring like that? Something else happen?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_start_1"><text>Everything's more or less the same. I've got a small request. There's been a curious fellow wandering the Zone. Supposedly a foreigner... though who really knows. A drunkard, a joker, a real oddball. If he showed up at the Bar, you could barely squeeze through here for a week straight. People would just pour in to listen to him. He was great at spinning tales. Where he claimed he'd been... obviously nonsense, but damn, he sold it with talent. An actor, plain and simple... And a nice profit for me. Stalkers eat and drink well while listening.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_start_2"><text>Half the people around here have talents like that.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_start_3"><text>Maybe, but not all of them. This one's special. And a foreigner, too.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_start_4"><text>Could be an alien for all I care. What do you want from me? I didn't sign up to be a clown. Entertain your own crowd.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_start_5"><text>No one's asking you to sing or dance. He needs to be found, the guy's gone missing. Last I heard, he was heading for the Red Forest. Duty boys at the checkpoint said he went through the Wild Territory. Carried away, the fool. If you're around there, have a look. Sure, monsters are nasty, anomalies and all that... It's not urgent, but still — a man was here, and now he's gone. Kind of a pity.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_start_61"><text>Any distinctive features? How do I recognize him? And what's his name?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_start_62"><text>Say your profits dropped, that's all. This whole "pity" thing...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_start_71"><text>He called himself Freeman. As for features... nothing special, really. Looked like an ordinary stalker. Oh, I remember! He had a fine pistol — a Desert Eagle. And he shot it damn well, even when drunk.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_start_72"><text>No need to be like that, Marked One. He was still a man...</text></string>

<string id="barmen_freeman_done_0"><text>Pour one, Barkeep. Let's drink to your storyteller.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_done_1"><text>You found him? Where, what happened?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_done_2"><text>In the Wild Territory, in an old tunnel. He set himself up a little den there. A bedroll in a container, a small campfire nearby, only... Looks like after the Blowout the tunnel exit got blocked by "Electras". He didn't get out. I figure he died of thirst or starvation.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_done_3"><text>Imagine that... better to fall into an anomaly or get torn apart by a bloodsucker. But like that... horrifying.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_done_41"><text>It happens. Better tell me this instead. How do you get from the Wild Territory to the Red Forest? He was heading there, right?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_done_42"><text>It happens. In the Zone, an easy death is a real rarity. Unless it's from a bullet...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_done_51"><text>You don't know? There's a passage, I'll mark it on your PDA. This road will take you to the eastern part of the forest, roughly around here. And thanks for not brushing my request off, you did the right thing.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_done_52"><text>Ah... Thanks for not brushing my request off, you did the right thing. And this is for you, as a token of gratitude.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_freeman_done_6"><text>Yeah, it's nothing... Just somehow it's not very cheerful again...</text></string>

<string id="lim_trader_parcel_dialog_1"><text>Well I'll be, you showed up. How should I know who he was. The guy described your mug, I knew right away it was about you. I don't care about his name. What matters is he shelled out the cash.</text></string>

<string id="shustriy_dummy_fire_dialog_1"><text>You actually ran into it? How was it?</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_dummy_fire_dialog_2"><text>A terrifying creature, I'll tell you. To take one like that down you'd need a howitzer. Burned through a ton of ammo before I put it down.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_dummy_fire_dialog_3"><text>Didn't you know that among identical monsters there are especially seasoned ones. Against those, you shouldn't even think of going in with a regular gun. The only good thing is they're extremely rare around here. They mostly live closer to the center of the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_dummy_fire_dialog_4"><text>Then I guess I got lucky.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_dummy_fire_dialog_5"><text>By the way, did it have an artifact on it? I told you about the "Bubble". I'm thinking of heading to the Bar one of these days, sick of this place already. On the way, you know it yourself, there are dogs everywhere. An artifact like that would really come in handy.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_dummy_fire_dialog_6"><text>And what in return? I'll warn you right away — junk won't cut it. For an artifact like that I can gear up at Sidorovich's.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_dummy_fire_dialog_7"><text>Yeah, just make sure you don't end up owing me. So... this... I can offer a pump-action shotgun, shortened — an "MP-133". Very compact and handy, five-round capacity. I'll also throw in some buckshot for it. For the local wildlife it'll be just right. And with buckshot you can go after more seasoned beasts too, not just dogs and tushkanos. Decide!</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_dummy_fire_dialog_81"><text>Hmm... deal.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_dummy_fire_dialog_82"><text>You're trying to swindle me, Shustry. No deal.</text></string>

<!-- new_dar_greens_yan_way -->
<string id="dar_greens_yan_way_dialog_0"><text>I'm here on an assignment from one of the Duty bosses.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yan_way_dialog_1"><text>From Voronin or what? They've got a habit of turning their noses up at regular folk over there. Like — "We're DUTY, and you're nobody"... Well, screw that... What do you want?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yan_way_dialog_2"><text>Yeah, they're like that... Not from Voronin. He's got a deputy in charge of food. Says he wants to make a deal with you about supplies...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yan_way_dialog_3"><text>Ah, that one. What's his name... Anyway, I get who you mean. Well... in principle, we're not against it. Those Duty guys are hunters too, seems like, also cleaning up the Zone. In their own way, sure. If they offer something worthwhile, we're in. I reckon we could feed fifty mouths, maybe even more...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yan_way_dialog_4"><text>He's asking for samples. For testing, sort of...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yan_way_dialog_5"><text>Oh yeah! Let's be straight, friend Marked One. You're a solid guy and all that, sure, but put yourself in my shoes — someone shows up, says he's from someone, and asks for our goods... Words alone don't fill a stomach, right?\nI can put together a box of samples for you, no problem, but you know how it is — quid pro quo. I sometimes travel a bit farther than the Bar on my own business. And in those parts the air's a bit poisoned. You get a cloak made for me from Stepanych, there's a craftsman like that. Just a regular one, but with a gas mask built in. Stepanych usually hangs around either in the Swamps or at the Forgotten Farmstead. I'll give you the material for the cloak — a couple of cured flesh hides — and as for the work itself, you'll settle that on the spot. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yan_way_dialog_61"><text>Hand over the hides, you'll get your cloak.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yan_way_dialog_62"><text>The Duty boys can manage without sausage.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_start_2"><text>Care to share, or is it a secret?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_start_3"><text>With you I can share, you're a proper man. You see, Marked One, I've put together a small arsenal, more or less. But ammo's a problem. I went to the military guys over at the pumping station, but they jacked the price up sky-high, and in hard currency to boot.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_start_4"><text>That's like them, sure enough — "one man's war is another man's business".</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_start_5"><text>Exactly.... How are things between you and Duty? I'm interested in their logistics deputy — Petrenko.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_start_6"><text>So far, fine. You could even say excellent.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_start_7"><text>Then I've got a favor to ask. Check with him, but don't push too hard, whether they could set up ammo supplies for us. I'm interested in 5.45x39 and 7.62x39 calibers. We've got plenty of pistol rounds and shotgun shells.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_start_8"><text>And how are you planning to pay? I'm not asking for myself.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_start_9"><text>The Swamps may be the edge of the Zone, but some artifacts do turn up here. Sometimes even second-tier ones. A tin or two doesn't interest me. I need at least a crate of ammo every month. If he agrees, we'll discuss the exact price personally. Either way, you'll get something for your trouble. A good recipe, for instance. Will you go and ask?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_start_91"><text>What you need that much ammo for is your business. I can ask, no skin off my nose.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_start_92"><text>Planning a little local war, are you? Count me out.</text></string>
<string id="tex_marsh_cook_ammo"><text>Sylvester asked me to check with Petrenko about the possibility of supplying ammunition</text></string>

<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_done_0"><text>Pour it up, Sylvester! I've got good news for you.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_done_1"><text>Could you keep it down? I'll pour later. What did Petrenko say?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_done_2"><text>He's not exactly against it, but there won't be a meeting with him. A Duty unit is currently stationed in the Swamps. Major Cherepanov is in charge. You'll have to settle everything with him.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_done_3"><text>So he didn't want to talk to me personally?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_done_4"><text>Busy man. Second in their hierarchy, practically the whole of Duty rests on him. A crate of ammo is peanuts to him. One wagon here, one wagon there — that's more his scale. And... where's what was supposed to fall my way?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_ammo_done_5"><text>Sorry, I got my head all muddled. Here... write down the recipe. Picked it up from the prof's assistant the other day...</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_0"><text>I'm here on an assignment, from the Swamps.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_1"><text>And who would need me there?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_2"><text>There's a certain character there at the scientists' base... He's their cook and a small-time trader, stands behind the counter... Long story short, his name's Sylvester, and he's very interested in the possibility of trading artifacts for ammo in 5.45x39 or 7.62x39. And straight up a full crate. He won't agree to less.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_3"><text>So what's happened in the Swamps that he suddenly needs that much ammunition? It's supposed to be a quiet place. What's there to fight over?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_4"><text>Personally, I don't care who's fighting whom over what. Maybe he just wants a stockpile. In case... someone attacks.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_5"><text>Could be... I've heard about their scientists from Sakharov. Studying all kinds of mutant trash, don't poke their noses beyond the Swamps... Strange... So he's offering artifacts? Well then, I'll need to think about it. And also check on your Sylvester through my own channels, see what kind of man he is, what makes him tick.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_6"><text>How long will I have to wait? Maybe I should come back later?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_71"><text>Hold on, don't rush... I've got a delicate matter for you. About a month ago, one of our fighters, a good one, suddenly left the unit and disappeared in an unknown direction. We're not the army, of course, but we don't encourage desertion! I'd like to find out what happened.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_72"><text>Hold on, don't rush... I've got a delicate matter for you. About a month ago, one of our fighters, a good one, suddenly left the unit and headed toward the Army Warehouses. As I later learned, he died there soon after. I don't know what pushed him to desert, and it doesn't matter anymore. What matters is that he left with all his gear, and it's still listed on our books.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_81"><text>You want me to convince him to come back... or something else? And where am I supposed to look for him, scour the whole Zone?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_82"><text>So what, you can't just write it off as combat losses?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_91"><text>Don't worry, others dug before you. He's at the Army Warehouses now, goes by the nickname Scarecrow. Go see him, talk to him. And try to get an answer to the question — should we expect this "prodigal son" back or not. If not, then the equipment he received from us ought to be returned. Why I'm not sending my own people, I think, is obvious. Hostile territory and all that. And would he even be frank with former comrades... You, on the other hand, are neutral. Maybe he won't clam up with you.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_92"><text>Can't sign it off while there's still a chance to return everything to the warehouse. The thing is, a friend of the deceased, who brought us the sad news, also shared information about where the dead man stashed our property when he bailed to civilian life. There's a little village in the Warehouses stalkers call "Krovososovka". That's where it all is, in the stove of one of the ruined houses. As you understand, I can't send my people to retrieve the gear on territory controlled by Freedom. That's why I'm asking you to handle it.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_101"><text>Talking to him is doable... I'll try.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_start_102"><text>Sounds simple enough. I'll try.</text></string>
<string id="tex_petrenko_ammo_article"><text>Petrenko asked me to find out why their former fighter nicknamed Scarecrow suddenly left the ranks of Duty. I should look for him at the Army Warehouses.</text></string>
<string id="tex_petrenko_ammo2_article"><text>Petrenko asked me to find and return property belonging to his faction that was taken some time ago to the Army Warehouses by a deserter. It should be hidden in the stove of one of the houses in the village of "Krovososovka".</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_ammo_done_0"><text>Greetings, commander. I met with your runaway.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_done_1"><text>And what did he say? How did he explain his... disappearance?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_done_2"><text>Long story short, he's tired of the Zone. Lost a friend not long ago. He's not coming back. Decided to wax his skis. Says he's going home. Asked me to return his gear so he wouldn't be considered a thief.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_done_3"><text>That's a shame. He was a good fighter. Not like some others. And you, I see, didn't disappoint either — could've pocketed it. I respect that.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_done_4"><text>Expenses ought to be compensated, don't you think?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_ammo_done_5"><text>Compensated... fine. Tell that Sylvester that a platoon under Major Cherepanov is currently quartered in the Swamps. Let him settle all matters with him. I've already warned him. I don't have time to be distracted by such trifles.</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_chuchelo_dialog_7"><text>No. I thought it over in my spare time — I spent half a year slogging it out in that "Duty", and what do I have to my name? Three holes and nothing else. I'll try the stalker life. I know the Zone pretty well by now. I think I can save up a bit for a rainy day. And then I'm gone. Home.\nYeah, by the way. To feel completely "clean", I should return the gear I got while in service. You heading to the Bar?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_chuchelo_dialog_8"><text>Sure, I'll take it. I'm headed that way anyway. I'll give it to Petrenko.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_chuchelo_dialog_9"><text>I stuffed it into a backpack in Krovososovka, it's in the stove of a ruined house. Keep it if you want, or give it back. There's body armor and an "Abakan" there.</text></string>

<string id="luber_darkscape_dialog_1"><text>Command ordered a change of position. For now we're sitting here, waiting for orders.</text></string>
<string id="luber_darkscape_dialog_2"><text>Ah... Wanted to ask something, if it's not a secret.</text></string>
<string id="luber_darkscape_dialog_3"><text>Depends on what you're interested in. Might answer.</text></string>
<string id="luber_darkscape_dialog_4"><text>So where were you planning to ski off to on that raid? Maybe I could tag along. I'm sick of all this running around. Time to get down to some serious business.</text></string>
<string id="luber_darkscape_dialog_5"><text>Hmm... You're a solid guy, Marked One, but we in "Duty" have our own rules and routines. We may not be the military, but we follow established rules strictly. You can't just go by "feel like it, don't feel like it". Regulations...</text></string>
<string id="luber_darkscape_dialog_6"><text>I've seen plenty of your regulation-style relations in the Bar. Some are on duty, while others rinse their throats from morning till night. Where does it all even fit.</text></string>

<string id="green_dan_passage_start_0"><text>Dan, how long are you going to take stinking tails as payment for passage?</text></string>
<string id="green_dan_passage_start_1"><text>What did you expect? Stinking or not, the Zone's getting cleaner.</text></string>
<string id="green_dan_passage_start_2"><text>Maybe so, but that's not what I mean... How about I bring you something worthwhile once, and then I can walk through calmly, without looking over my shoulder. There are plenty of people to cleanse the world of all sorts of filth. Around here it's step left, step right — if it's not a tushkano, it's a dog, or something even meaner. If I brought in all the monster parts I shoot just to trade for buckshot, you'd have to hand me a whole wagon of that ammo.</text></string>
<string id="green_dan_passage_start_3"><text>You've certainly proven your usefulness. And we treat you with all due respect. But breaking the rules...</text></string>
<string id="green_dan_passage_start_4"><text>Oh come on, Dan. What rules, who approved them? Tell the village guys about lofty ideals. You're not throwing that monster meat in the trash anyway. You're running your own little business too, right? Food, water, clothes, weapons — none of that falls from the sky. You get it somewhere, for something.</text></string>
<string id="green_dan_passage_start_5"><text>You haven't been drinking today, have you? Doesn't seem like it smells... Alright, we'll make a deal if you bring me either three cured flesh hides or five raw ones. I'll order myself a cloak from Stepanych.

<string id="tex_green_dan_passage"><text>Dan asks that, in exchange for permanent free passage to Kishka, there and back, I bring him either three cured flesh hides or five raw ones. He also promises to set aside more buckshot for me to trade.</text></string>

<string id="green_dan_passage_done_1"><text>If you're talking about the hides, then yes.</text></string>
<string id="green_dan_passage_done_21"><text>Take the three cured ones.</text></string>
<string id="green_dan_passage_done_22"><text>Brought five raw ones.</text></string>
<string id="green_dan_passage_done_23"><text>Just wanted to check if you'd changed your mind.</text></string>
<string id="green_dan_passage_done_3"><text>Well then. From now on, the passage is always open for you. Just don't go rushing headlong — stop by, exchange a few words now and then, otherwise other stalkers might see and not understand. They might think we've got favoritism going on here.

<string id="shurup_instrument_start_0"><text>Why the sour mug? Down in the dumps again?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_start_1"><text>No, not really. Mental work's got my body all tense, not used to it.\nSome kind soul brought me a pile of technical manuals on weapons. I'm trying to figure out how to do various upgrades and tuning in these local, makeshift conditions. So far it's going rough.\nWithout a bottle, all my brain folds got tangled up. You don't happen to have one on you?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_start_2"><text>Soon there won't be anything left to tangle, you'll drink it all away, brains included.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_start_3"><text>You're wrong, Marked One. I've more or less grasped the principle, the noggin's still working. I just need narrowly specialized tools, for fine tuning and calibration. Where are you supposed to find those in the Zone? I tried working with what I had, but only messed everything up.\nMaybe you could swing by Sidorovich, and grab some vodka while you're at it?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_start_4"><text>Have you lost your mind, pal?!</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_start_5"><text>You got me wrong. I ordered the tools from Sidorovich. He opened a line of credit for me a long time ago, and I help him out from time to time... with various things. I figure my limit isn't used up yet, so I'm just asking you to work a bit as a courier. Well, if it turns out to be short by a bit, you can top it up from your own, alright?\nAnd once I've got the tools, I'll upgrade some gun for you free of charge. For example, right now I'm getting my hand in on pump-actions. Our guys just got a batch of new shotguns, and I'm planning to convert them to semi-auto fire. It'll be a killer piece, high rate of fire. And considering the magazine capacity — any critter's done for. Cool, right? So, will you help?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_start_61"><text>If I'm at Sidorovich's, I'll ask about your tools.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_start_62"><text>Getting his hand in, huh... Find someone younger to run to the Cordon.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_start_71"><text>That's great then. And grab some vodka too, yeah?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_start_72"><text>Pity... Oh well, I'll keep poking around like this for now. Maybe someone more agreeable will turn up later.</text></string>
<string id="tex_shurup_instrument"><text>Shurup offered me courier work: I need to bring him a crate of new tools from Sidorovich. Supposedly payment between them is already arranged, but as a last resort he asks me to pay out of my own pocket. In return he promises to upgrade some gun for me.</text></string>

<string id="shurup_instrument_done_0"><text>I brought you the crate with the tools.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_done_1"><text>I was starting to worry something happened to you... Did you bring any vodka?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_done_2"><text>You bastard, why didn't you warn me your credit with Sidor's been maxed out for ages? By the way, I had to hand over a valuable artifact for that crate. Take it. You owe me big time now, keep that in mind. And to hell with you, no vodka for you, got it?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_done_3"><text>Alright, alright, why're you yelling like that? Well, yeah... now that I think about it, my credit really did go "poof"... back last summer. Don't be mad, but I really need these tools. Big thanks for bringing them anyway. Here, take a few repair kits, might come in handy.\nLet's check the shipment... So much stuff here... There's even a caliper. Now that's what I call it!</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_done_4"><text>You can admire it later. Better tell me, what about the shotguns? Your Lukash issued me a "USAS-12". Can it be upgraded or what?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_done_5"><text>Bring it over. I'll do it right. You won't regret it.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_instrument_done_6"><text>I'll believe you this time.</text></string>

<string id="esc_trader_shurup_instrument_0"><text>I'm here about the tools for Shurup. He said everything's settled between you.</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_shurup_instrument_11"><text>Settled, yes. I just thought he'd come for them himself. Sent you instead, did he? And what's that master-fixer planning to repair that he had to order a whole set of tools straight from the capital?</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_shurup_instrument_12"><text>Marked One, I already told you: the order's here. Pay and take it. A "dummy" class artifact in good condition. Verstehen, nicht?</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_shurup_instrument_21"><text>As I understand it, he's taken up improving weapon characteristics. So, the order's arrived — can I take it?</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_shurup_instrument_221"><text>Ah, damn, right! The artifact... There'll be an artifact, but later.</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_shurup_instrument_222"><text>Look, will this one do for you?</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_shurup_instrument_31"><text>Yeah, it's lying over there in the corner, waiting. You didn't forget the payment, I hope? I warned Shurup right away I'd ask at least a good-condition "dummy" class artifact. He's lucky I didn't have to import the goods from abroad. That would've cost him twice as much.</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_shurup_instrument_32"><text>That'll do nicely. I don't get ones like this often. You wouldn't tell me where you dug it up, would you? Ah well. Take your crate.</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_shurup_instrument_41"><text>What do you mean? And what about the credit? I was told the payment would go against the credit opened for Shurup. Supposedly the limit wasn't used up yet, and if it was a bit short I could add some. You don't mean to say it's short by the equivalent of a whole "dummy", do you?</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_shurup_instrument_42"><text>I'll go "congratulate" Shurup on his new acquisition and say a few kind words.</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_shurup_instrument_5"><text>Snap out of it, you poor soul. It's been almost a year since I stopped giving that drunk anything on credit. At first he paid back at least somehow, then he did small errands for me when I had liquidity problems, but how much debt can you write off like that? The ordered tools are really damn expensive, you heard it yourself. So there are no options here: pay, or I'll have to look for another buyer.</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_shurup_instrument_6"><text>Well damn... Quite a situation. I need to think.</text></string>

<string id="shurup_spas_improve_start_0"><text>You taking on upgrading the "USAS"?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_spas_improve_start_1"><text>If you brought it, hand it over. I reworked a couple for our guys here for field tests. They can't praise them enough.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_spas_improve_start_2"><text>And how long will it take? And in general...</text></string>
<string id="shurup_spas_improve_start_3"><text>I'll do it in half a day. Experience, you could say, is already there. I won't charge you, like I promised. Just show some respect with a bottle, that'll be enough.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_spas_improve_start_41"><text>Feels kind of sketchy handing something like this over to you. Ah, whatever, here.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_spas_improve_start_42"><text>Seems to me if you take it apart, no one will be able to put it back together. Better later.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_spas_improve_start_51"><text>I'll let you know when it's ready.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_spas_improve_start_52"><text>If it seems that way — cross yourself, and when you decide, come by.</text></string>

<string id="shurup_spas_improve_done_0"><text>How's my "USAS" doing?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_spas_improve_done_11"><text>Marked One, don't hover over me, you're getting in the way.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_spas_improve_done_12"><text>Better than before. The barrel's a sight to behold. Shiny as a cat's private parts.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_spas_improve_done_21"><text>Work, work...</text></string>
<string id="shurup_spas_improve_done_22"><text>I'm not here to admire it. Done yet?</text></string>

<string id="shurup_spas_improve_done_42"><text>I'll go too, test it out in the field.</text></string>

<string id="fal_up_quest"><text>Shurup's Rifle Upgrade</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_start_0"><text>Hey there, "thinker"! What's got you wracking your brain? Don't tell me it's about where to get another drink? The fumes from you hit from ten steps away...</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_start_1"><text>That's just me wiping down some mechanisms with alcohol. What I'm racking my brain over is how to get my hands on a certain little thing.\nSee, a close buddy of mine ordered himself an "FN FAL" rifle from beyond the perimeter, and it arrived yesterday. Powerful and reliable piece, but here's the snag — turned out the model that came has no mounts for attachments, and the magazine's small, only 20 rounds, and in general... it turned out to be a really awkward weapon. Returns, obviously, aren't an option. Sure, they smacked the middleman trader around for not warning them in advance, but what good did that do? My buddy burned a lot of money, and the rifle can't really be used properly.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_start_2"><text>There's a saying about situations like that, but I'll keep quiet. So what's this little thing you're trying to get? Some kind of "consolation prize" for your friend?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_start_3"><text>You're almost spot on. I saw in one weapons magazine that there are special upgrade kits like that, with all the necessary parts and gadgets to turn basic models into mega-advanced ones. Like special forces would take a break. So I want to get such a kit for the FAL.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_start_4"><text>So what's the problem then? Afraid you'll run into a shady trader yourself? I could recommend someone, if you need.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_start_5"><text>No need, I know who to talk to. The thing is, I've spent a lot lately after that last tool purchase, and I don't want to ask our guys for help — they'll laugh us to death over this whole story. Will you help me out, Marked One? I don't really have much to repay you with, but if you ever need to upgrade a FAL yourself, I'll be ready to do it for a purely symbolic fee — those kits come with everything in duplicate.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_start_61"><text>Well, what can you do with you "poor souls"... Alright, I'll try to help. An identical upgrade might come in handy for me too. For a "purely symbolic" fee...</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_start_62"><text>So basically, your buddy got fleeced, and now you're offering me to pay for his expenses? Find yourself a fool!</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_start_71"><text>There we go, thanks, Marked One! I already checked around through some contacts: the required FAL upgrade kit should be with Voron. You know that slick guy from the Dark Valley? The goods were delivered on special order for some stalker, but for reasons unknown to me the deal fell through, so Voron will be only too happy to find a new buyer.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_start_72"><text>I didn't really expect you to understand anyway...</text></string>
<string id="tex_shurup_fal_upgrade_article"><text>Freedom mechanic Shurup is asking for help upgrading an "FAL" rifle for his friend. To do that he needs a special weapon upgrade kit that should be in Voron's possession. In return, he promises to help me with a similar upgrade if needed.</text></string>

<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_done_0"><text>Dance for joy, Shurup Samorezovich! I hauled in your weapon upgrade kit.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_done_1"><text>Whoa! Now that's news! Show me already.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_done_2"><text>Here, and don't drop it — the case is pretty bulky.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_done_3"><text>Let's see what we've got here. Alright, rails... fittings... stocks here... Awesome! I'll do everything top-notch, my buddy won't even realize it's the same rifle. Huge thanks, Marked One!</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_done_4"><text>Happy for your buddy. You owe me now, don't forget.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_done_5"><text>No question about it. If you ever need it, come by with your own FAL, I'll do some slick tuning for it too. Just keep in mind the rifle has to be in good shape — with a beat-up one, I'm afraid it won't work.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_done_6"><text>Alright. See you.</text></string>

<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_refuse_0"><text>Shurup, I talked to Voron about your issue. You know what price he named for the upgrade kit?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_refuse_1"><text>I don't know, but I can guess. What, can't afford it?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_refuse_2"><text>I'll be straight: it's not worth it. Sorry, but you'll have to look for another seller or drop the whole idea. Either way — without me, I've already run enough, that's it.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_upgrade_kit_refuse_3"><text>Thanks for at least trying, Marked One. I'll think about what to do next.</text></string>

<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_start_0"><text>Hey, Shurup, I want to upgrade my "FN FAL" rifle. Remember our deal?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_start_1"><text>I don't seem to be complaining about memory loss yet. Take it out, let's see.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_start_21"><text>Here. Looks like a regular base model, right? Can you work your magic on this one like you promised?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_start_22"><text>Uh... looks like I'm the one with memory problems after all. Left it somewhere... I'll be back soon.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_start_3"><text>No problem. I told you, it'll be like special forces gear. As agreed, the payment for the job is a "purely symbolic" one — a crate of the white stuff.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_start_4"><text>Have you completely lost it, pal? First I bought you a tool kit from Sidor, then I handed you a weapon upgrade kit for free, lent a helping hand in a tough moment, you could say, and now you're demanding a whole crate of vodka from me for a trivial service. Got any conscience?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_start_51"><text>Oh come on, Marked One. By the way, last time I didn't take anything for working on your "USAS". And now I'm in need — I told you, I've got to wipe down parts and all that... Well, at least half a crate, huh? Why are you staring like that? Alright, alright, you'll spot me one bottle — and we're even.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_start_52"><text>Oh come on, Marked One. Maybe next time I won't take anything from you at all. And now I'm in need — I told you, I've got to wipe down parts and all that... Well, at least half a crate, huh? Why are you staring like that? Alright, alright, you'll spot me one bottle — and we're even.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_start_6"><text>That's more like it! By the way, what parts were we talking about wiping down? Parts of your own body? Alright, forget it. Get to work already. How long will it take?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_start_7"><text>I think I'll manage in about six hours. The technology's already been worked out. I'll give you a signal when everything's ready.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_start_8"><text>Alright. I'll go get some vodka in the meantime.</text></string>

<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_done_0"><text>Shurup, I got your message and came to pick up my rifle.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_done_1"><text>Yeah, I've been waiting for you. Brought the bottle? The piece turned out — pure fire. Should've bargained for cognac.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_done_21"><text>Say, you didn't happen to sell Herbalife in the past, did you? Take what's offered and show me what you did.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_done_22"><text>Damn it... I forgot about the vodka. Wait here, I'll be back soon.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_done_31"><text>Here, take it. Mounted rails for optics, replaced the fittings, installed a new stock, cleaned it, lubricated it. On top of that, there's a set of extended-capacity magazines. With a rifle like this you can march straight into Pripyat.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_fal_upgrade_done_4"><text>It really does look top notch. I'd better get going, I can see you're already itching to "wipe" something down with vodka...</text></string>

<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_start_dlg_0"><text>Hi, Voron, I'm here on business. Freedom mechanic Shurup asked me to drop by and get a weapon upgrade kit for an "FN FAL" rifle. You do have one, right?</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_start_dlg_1"><text>Oh, another one! That kit lay around useless for ages after the original buyer disappeared, and now two new contenders show up in a single day.</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_start_dlg_2"><text>Are you saying I'm too late? The goods already gone?</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_start_dlg_3"><text>Lucky for you — no. We couldn't agree on the price right away, your competitor decided to take time to "think it over".</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_start_dlg_4"><text>So how much did you ask? Or...</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_start_dlg_5"><text>Exactly — "or". You know I'm primarily interested in unusual and rare items. At the moment I have an order for a mercenary exoskeleton. That thing is fairly rare even among the mercs themselves. I'm not on the best terms with that rabble, and few dare to deal with them. Still, I know there's a merc post at the Army Warehouses, and there's a guy hanging around there nicknamed Vakhtang. He's quite loyal toward stalkers and even trades with them. I'm sure getting an exo through Vakhtang won't be too difficult.</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_start_dlg_6"><text>Oh hell... An exoskeleton in exchange for some weapon kit! Are you out of your mind?</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_start_dlg_7"><text>And not just any exoskeleton — a new one, absolutely new. No used cast-offs will do. That's my offer, period. Well, I might also throw in some ammo out of charity. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_start_dlg_81"><text>My kindness will be the death of me someday. On the other hand, I can always squeeze Shurup for his debt if needed. Bottom line — you'll get your exoskeleton, Voron.</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_start_dlg_82"><text>I don't like it when someone twists my arms first and then offers a handshake.</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_start_dlg_91"><text>Your squabbles don't concern me. You'll sort out who owes whom yourselves. You and I have our own deal — so get to fulfilling it.</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_start_dlg_92"><text>That's life. No deal, then no deal.</text></string>
<string id="tex_voron_upgrade_kit_article"><text>Voron offered to exchange the weapon upgrade kit he has for an "FN FAL" rifle for a brand-new mercenary exoskeleton. One like that can be obtained from Vakhtang, a merc at the Army Warehouses.</text></string>

<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_done_dlg_0"><text>I got you the merc exoskeleton, Voron. Everything as agreed.</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_done_dlg_1"><text>Excellent! Hand it over, I need to check its condition.</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_done_dlg_2"><text>I'm telling you, it's brand new — everything as agreed. But go on, check it, I don't mind.</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_done_dlg_3"><text>Yep, everything's in perfect order. Here's your weapon kit and the promised ammo bonus. A pleasure doing business with you, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="voron_upgrade_kit_done_dlg_4"><text>You all say that, but once you ask for something... Ah, forget it. See you around.</text></string>

<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_start_1"><text>That's it, this guy's got me fed up! U-u-ugh, bastard! He sucks the life out of people. Whoever goes on a raid with him — all die! He's the only one who comes back alive and well! Fifth case already! In short, something unclean is going on here. And about his last partner, Valerka Shkelet, they say his fate was downright terrifying.\nI was the one who invited Valerka into the Zone. And now what am I supposed to tell his father and mother? They don't even have anything to bury.\nWe need to find this bastard and sort things out our own way...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_start_2"><text>Careful there, you're getting worked up. I don't deal in bloody business, but I agree — something here is definitely not right. I could try to clear things up, if you want. Tell me his name and at least roughly where to look for him.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_start_3"><text>Ghoul's his nickname. A ghoul, plain and simple. He steals people's luck — get it? He was seen in the Dark Valley recently. Might still be there. Just be careful with him, who knows.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_start_4"><text>Sounds like the devil himself, horns and all. I'll go have a talk with him.</text></string>

<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_0"><text>Mind if I sit?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_1"><text>What? If you want something, say it. Otherwise, get lost!</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_2"><text>No need to be rude right away. I don't think I've done anything to you. By the way, my name's Marked One. And yours?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_3"><text>Marked One, you say? Heard of you... Is that you they hauled with corpses in a truck? My name's Renat. That's enough.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_4"><text>Then nice to meet you, Renat. As for the truck — who knows, I don't remember. I came to in Sidorovich's basement, and before that — nothing in my head, empty.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_5"><text>Yeah? Lucky you. I mean it. I'd gladly smash my head against a rock myself, just to wipe away everything that's piled up in there. Lost so many partners... Some kind of curse.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_6"><text>What happened? Why did it turn out that way?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_7"><text>Why? E-e-eh... Carelessness, overconfidence, refusal to think things through, greed — can't do without that. Everything's mixed in.\nMy first partner jumped at a rat! Either it bit him or something. He jerked, stumbled, and slammed full tilt into a "Trampoline". He was a good guy. Cheerful.\nThe second got driven onto a rock by blind dogs, they knocked the rifle out of his hands. And he didn't have a backup weapon... Said he didn't want to carry extra weight...\nThe third... The third was Slava the Runner. We did, what... three runs together, yeah. Made decent profit. Then he spotted an artifact in a little swamp. The Geiger's crackling like crazy, the artifact's bouncing around down there, and Slava keeps trying to grab it. He did grab it. Only an hour later he couldn't move anymore. Radiation burned out all his insides. And we didn't have any anti-rads. Thought we could just drink vodka if anything... I dragged him back to base, but the next day he passed away.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_8"><text>Yeah... That's something.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_9"><text>Diman, my fourth partner, basically died by accident. A tushkano flew into an anomaly, it collapsed and spat out the remains... Well, a bone went straight into Diman's eye. Can you imagine? Incredible, but... an accident.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_10"><text>No one's safe from that. And the fifth?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_11"><text>Shkelet? Yeah, he met a terrible death...\nWe were returning from a long raid through the Foggy Thicket, a deadly place. Picked up some decent loot. We were heading toward the Dark Valley, past a lake. There's one there, full of "Jelly". I went first, he followed. It was quiet. Suddenly — a crack, a scream... Valerchik fell through. Right into the "Jelly", dead center. He stepped onto the planks. What possessed him?! While I was trying to figure out what to do, he was already dissolved up to the waist, and then gone completely... His scream still rings in my ears.\nLater I went down there, scooped some of that sludge into a jar, and saw a gold crown floating on top. That's all that was left of the man...\nI've sworn off it now! No more partners. I'd rather die myself than go through that again.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_12"><text>I see. Do you want to give the jar with his remains to his parents? At least they'll have a grave. I can take it to the Barman — he has contacts with relatives.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_13"><text>Yeah? That's good. Then take it.\nBy the way, Valerchik's backpack with the capsule in a container is still in that lake. I didn't go in... I mean, the backpack was obviously dissolved by the anomaly, but the container should've survived. If you're in the thicket and need a good artifact, look for it. Let me mark the approximate spot on your map.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_14"><text>Alright, I'll remember. Take care, Ghoul... And don't envy me.</text></string>

<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_done_0"><text>So, Ghoul confessed, basically. Looks like he's not guilty.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_done_1"><text>Did you find out what happened to his partners?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_done_2"><text>Some died from their own foolishness, another lost his head to greed. And for someone else, fate dealt a bad hand. The Zone's like that. And your acquaintance ended up in "Jelly", in the Foggy Thicket. The plank under him cracked, probably rotted through.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_done_3"><text>Yeah... And how am I supposed to look Valerka's parents in the eye now. Didn't manage to keep the kid safe.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_done_4"><text>Ghoul gave me a jar with the substance that dissolved your acquaintance. You can see his gold crown in it. Give it to the parents, let them bury it.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_done_5"><text>I'll definitely pass it on. At least they'll have something to remember their son by. Ah... remember the lad.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_upir_dialog_done_6"><text>Well then, I'll be going. It's not very cheerful around here.</text></string>

<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_start_0"><text>Word is someone really took you to the cleaners. True... or just rumors?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_start_1"><text>Cleaned me out like a sucker. There was this schemer hanging around here. Took me for everything I had. Whatever he throws — he wins, again and again. I've got a suspicion about that. Needs checking.\nYou're not too well-known yet, maybe you could get him talking about that incredible "luck"? And I won't skimp on the reward. I'll thank you like a king! Just hurry, if you want a nice cut. He might up and vanish, and then good luck finding him.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_start_2"><text>First tell me where to go and who to look for. Then I'll think about it.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_start_3"><text>It's not far. He hangs around the Army Warehouses. They call him Brainiac. Maybe you've heard?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_start_4"><text>Maybe I have. Though I get the feeling he won't say much. Still... they don't charge for asking, right?</text></string>

<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_0"><text>You're Brainiac, right? Didn't get you mixed up?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_1"><text>That's me. And who might you be?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_2"><text>I've got just one name — Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_3"><text>We're all marked, one way or another. Got business, or is this just hello and goodbye?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_4"><text>I got curious about a rumor about you. They say at the Bar that luck treats you real wild? Like you left Baldy without his pants and all that?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_5"><text>Left Baldy without pants, sure! He's probably got so much loot piled up that if he ever decides to leave the Zone, he'll need to order a truck. And that's just to haul the artifacts out. But he won't leave. Plenty of suckers around. Every day's a profit. Now that's luck. And me — I placed a couple of bets, true, big ones, and luck smiled on me. And people are already happy to spin tales.\nGot lucky by chance... Or maybe not by chance. Ever heard of the artifact "Luck"? Lots of stories going around, but nobody's seen it with their own eyes. And if they have, would they tell?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_6"><text>The "Luck" artifact?! Haven't heard of that one.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_7"><text>Well, supposedly there's an artifact that brings luck — like you randomly hit a tushkano in the eye from half a kilometer with a shotgun, find good artifacts, always get invited on easy, well-paid jobs... And you're always lucky in cards or other games. That's the idea.\nAnd not long ago I found an artifact, hell knows what kind, nobody had seen anything like it before. I wanted to sell it at Yantar, but then my luck went crazy at the Bar! And after that, as soon as I stepped outside — picked up a couple more artifacts and a capsule! Maybe it's not because of it... but what if it is?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_8"><text>Yeah, sounds like a good thing... Maybe you'd sell it? Things haven't been going my way lately. What if your artifact really is that very "Luck"?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_9"><text>Selling it is possible... But you have to understand, I can't give any guarantees. Maybe I just got lucky that day. That happens, right?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_10"><text>Name your price.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_11"><text>Then, to cut to the chase... bring me a check for a thousand bucks and the artifact is yours. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_12"><text>That's not a small sum. I'll think about it.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_13"><text>Just think fast. If you came here, others will too. And someone will turn out more agreeable.</text></string>

<string id="lisiy_umnik_2dialog_0"><text>Haven't sold "Luck" yet, or already?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_2dialog_1"><text>A couple of people came by, but they're also... thinking. So, decided to buy it?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_2dialog_21"><text>Yeah, here's the check.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_2dialog_22"><text>Still looking.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_2dialog_3"><text>Well then, it's yours. Just, as they say... don't mess it up yourself.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_2dialog_4"><text>I'm not a believer.</text></string>

<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_done_0"><text>I talked to Brainiac, sort of heart to heart.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_done_1"><text>Heart to heart my ass! He's a con artist! I dug up something on that character. Sent a runner after you to warn you, but looks like you missed each other.\nHe plays rarely, but always big. If he scores a good haul, his accomplices spread rumors among stalkers about some exotic artifact that supposedly brings luck. You're lucky at dice, always get Blackjack in cards, artifacts fall into your backpack from the sky, and all that nonsense. The suckers bite, and he sells them all kinds of crap as a "curiosity" for good money. By the time people figure it out, he's long gone.\nI can tell by your face: you bought something from him. Right?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_done_2"><text>Yeah, an artifact, called "Luck"...</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_done_3"><text>Well aren't you something, a top-grade sucker. And how much did you give? Just curious. Heh-heh...</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_done_4"><text>A check for a grand... So what now? If I see him, I'll crush the bastard.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_done_5"><text>I think it's already too late. He most likely slipped away. Few people have seen his face. He either walks around in a gas mask or a mask. Changed his suit, gave different personal details, and that's it. Who'll recognize him? But don't worry, we'll nail the bastard. I've got an idea.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_done_6"><text>And what about me? Sit around waiting for you to catch that goat? Compensation would be nice. You're the one who sent me to him. Promised a "royal haul". So you pay.</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_done_7"><text>You're right there, can't argue with that... No cash right now, but I can offer a couple of artifacts. Sound good?</text></string>
<string id="lisiy_umnik_dialog_done_8"><text>When there's no fish... anything will do.</text></string>

<string id="dsc_ecolog_vasilyev_search_2"><text>Sakharov sent me to the swamp to look for traces of Vasilyev's group. I found a whole suit, tightly sealed. While I was examining it, something strange happened. Some kind of red flash and... nothing — no body, no suit, just the belongings. This PDA was there too. I listened to the recording and compared it. You can hear someone saying: "Sakharov is a coward, he's not responding!!!". Listen yourself — do you recognize this voice?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_vasilyev_search_3"><text>I don't know, I don't know... The recording is of poor quality, I wouldn't want to jump to conclusions. Could you leave it with me for a while? Besides that, there may be some scientific data on it. It will hardly be of interest to you.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_vasilyev_search_4"><text>I could even give it to you for good, but I'd like something in return. It didn't come easy to me.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_vasilyev_search_5"><text>I understand, I understand... A stalker-style... exchange. I'm having some financial difficulties, but I can offer a good specimen of a first-tier artifact. Artifacts with such properties, believe me, are extremely rare. I also have some anti-radiation drugs.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_vasilyev_search_61"><text>Alright, give me your artifact and the anti-rads.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_vasilyev_search_62"><text>I'd rather keep the PDA for myself, no offense.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_vasilyev_search_71"><text>Here you go. As stalkers say, the artifact is "all green".</text></string>

<string id="barmen_monsters_part_1"><text>If there's an urgent order for some kind of mutant, then I'll take it. Otherwise, no. There's more hassle with it than profit. The stuff's perishable. Where am I supposed to store it in such quantities? You'd need a cold storage facility, plus a refrigerated truck to move it. Nothing but overhead costs. Artifacts are simpler and more reliable. And the profit is several times higher.</text></string>

But don't expect big money, I'll tell you that right away. Otherwise... I'll repeat myself: I only take mutant parts on order. Sometimes, very rarely, for myself, but only for culinary purposes and in small quantities. As for the Swamps, the scientists there are interested in all kinds of guts, Sakharov from Yantar too.

<string id="mil_trader_aver_start_dialog_1"><text>In principle, yes... You already know that we managed to dig a passage into the Foggy Thicket. Strange place, I tell you, there's a bad smell coming from there. I can smell it — there's something there that should be greatly feared.</text></string>

<string id="mil_trader_aver_start_dialog_3"><text>Have you already dealt with our brave neighbors? I mean the mercenaries. We've got something like a truce with them right now. They're sitting quietly, peacefully, not bothering anyone. And that's suspicious. That gang didn't settle here for nothing — they're waiting for a signal, that's a fact.\nThere's information that somewhere in the northern part of the Foggy Thicket, those bastards set up and mothballed a base. They'll wait for reinforcements and then strike from two sides. It won't be pretty. We need that place scouted. What do you say?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_aver_start_dialog_4"><text>And what about your brave and daring boys? Or are they fearless only in words, and when it comes down to it... they crap their pants?</text></string>

I already reported my suspicions to Lukash, but he just waves it off. Like... says I should drink less.\nSo here's the thing — you're an outsider, hopefully nobody's tailing you. You come and go, who cares. You'll head into that thicket, take a quick look around, see what's what, and come back. If we send our own, they'll spend a week getting ready, then another week drinking to a successful raid. Not like the mercs — even the dogs on the Cordon would know who's going where.\nAnd when you get back, I'll either give you a recipe or pay you some cash. Then we'll celebrate.</text></string>

<string id="mil_trader_aver_start_dialog_7"><text>Don't rush to die, Marked One. If there were anyone there, those sitting here would've stirred up long ago. But it's all quiet and peaceful. You've got to understand these things.</text></string>

<string id="serafim_dialog_new_start_107"><text>Nice to meet you, Marked One! You're right, I'm not a stalker... Well, not exactly. I work for government agencies. Callsign "Seraphim-12". So that's what you can call me.\nAnd I did have medical supplies, and good ones. Probably no one around here has ever seen medicine like that...\nI ditched it, along with almost all my cargo. In the Wild Territory, zombified stalkers pinned me down in a tunnel with fire anomalies — barely fought my way out. But all my gear burned up.\nOnly the scanners I was tasked with installing survived.</text></string>

I've already installed two, three more left. But looks like it's not meant to be now...\nYeah, they're going to drill my brain out over this... I already took the advance.\nListen, maybe you could install them? I'll reward you! No doubt about it! So, what do you say? Just keep in mind — the scanners need to be installed quickly. You'll have five days for each scanner. No more.</text></string>
<string id="serafim_dialog_new_start_1092"><text>You can get onto an old road not far from here, it leads to the Rostok plant's railway depot.

<string id="serafim_dialog_new_start_11011"><text>One's with me, two more I left at the Bar — they're heavy as hell. If you install this one, find me there and we'll talk about the rest. Take it.</text></string>

<string id="serafim_dialog_new_start_11013"><text>Look, installation is simple as can be: place it exactly at the designated point and it starts working automatically.

<string id="serafim_dialog_2_scaner_3"><text>You can get there, through Limansk, straight north, I think you won't miss it. I'll send you the transition point. But not everyone who went there managed to come back alive and well. Supposedly the electricity hits so hard there it's no joke. And in some places there are high-frequency electromagnetic fields — you can get fried like in a microwave. This isn't a "Burner" anomaly — you can't just drop your suit and run.

<string id="serafim_dialog_2_scaner_5"><text>Never had the chance. If I had, I'd have installed the scanner myself already. I've heard stories from those who were there... They saw some weird large, round contraptions. They say that's what caused all of this. Knowledgeable guides claim that there actually is a more or less safe path there. But where exactly it is, I don't know. Ask around — maybe you'll get lucky and find out.</text></string>

It's on Radar, right at this point. As far as we know, the Brain Scorcher doesn't reach the installation site, so you shouldn't worry too much... It would be good if you manage to install it within five days.\nAnd a little gift for a job well done...</text></string>

<string id="serafim_dialog_done_31"><text>Hold on... Over at Yantar, some nerd managed—don't ask me how—to dig up information on a certain recipe. Sorry I didn't remember it right away, had other things on my mind. I'm no expert in this stuff, but among stalkers, as I understand it, such information is in high demand. That nerd swore, though he was drunk at the time, that if you cook up some artifact using that recipe, you can practically walk around the Tesla in your underwear. I'll send it to your PDA, and after that it's up to you.\nAnd I also heard, out of the corner of my ear, that you're looking for Ghost?</text></string>

<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_204"><text>Ivar? You're the one I need. Don't rush, calm down a bit. I'm Marked One. You're Ivar. Let's try to talk. Alright? Say something if you understand.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_205"><text>Yes... Marked One... Hard to speak. Let's try...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_206"><text>So here's the thing: I was on Radar, thought it gets shut down there. Poked at some switches, and then it... Damn it! I should probably keep it simpler.\nIvar, did you shut down the "Brain Scorcher"?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_207"><text>Mmm... Yes... No... Mine... There, underground... Strelok... Gave diagrams, blueprints, plans... Don't remember. In vain... He asked... shouldn't have...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_208"><text>Strelok gave you the diagrams? And where is he himself?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_209"><text>Yes... Diagrams, maps... he had them. Don't know... where from... He left... Asked not to do it. Not to shut it down. Dangerous... He turned it on... There was no other way... I didn't understand back then...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_210"><text>What did he ask you not to do? Not to shut down the "Brain Scorcher", right? But why?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_211"><text>There, beyond Radar, something... He was suppressing it... With radiation. I didn't understand... It was hard to grasp...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_212"><text>Yeah, well. And I don't understand you. So on Radar, Strelok turned on the "Brain Scorcher"? That's nonsense. How is that even possible? What was he trying to suppress with radiation? And how did he know?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_213"><text>Tired... Get to the point...</text></string> 
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_214"><text>Alright, sorry. What's beyond Radar, up north?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_215"><text>Monolith... That's what he called it... Creates a field... of powerlessness, apathy... Drives people mad. Illusions... Expanding. It'll get worse for everyone...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_216"><text>Monolith? That's all just fairy tales... Alright, that's not the point. Strelok's diagrams. Where did he get them and where are they now?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_217"><text>Don't know... where from. Later... about that. I'm getting worse... Listen, while I still can... talk.\nThe scientists. They can tell... more about the "Rainbow"... It must be turned on... The scientists. There. In the city. In the Ivankovsky District Center. Go... He said... And I didn't believe him... Mmmm...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_218"><text>District Center? Which District Center?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_219"><text>Yes, yes... There. Go...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_220"><text>So, the Ivankovsky District Center. If only I knew how to get there.</text></string>
<string id="radar_on_a"><text>Start the Brain Scorcher</text></string>
<string id="tex_radar_on_article"><text>As it turned out, the radiation from the installation on Radar, while preventing stalkers from advancing north, at the same time helped contain the spread of a certain field of powerlessness and apathy coming from somewhere in the center of the Zone, possibly from the station itself. It is necessary to restart the "Brain Scorcher" as soon as possible, otherwise I fear that the entire Zone will become deserted very soon. Or something even worse may happen. Easy to say — "restart the Brain Scorcher". But how is that to be done?</text></string>
<string id="tex_radar_on_deadcity_article"><text>First things first, I need to find a way into the Ivankovsky District Center. From Ivar's words, I understood that a group of scientists is stationed there. They may be able to share details about how the "Brain Scorcher" works. This installation is also known by another name — the "Rainbow".</text></string>

<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_401"><text>Hard... Can't...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_402"><text>Yeah, I get it... Rest.</text></string>

<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_501"><text>Mmm...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_502"><text>How are you?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_503"><text>Seems to be letting go. A doctor came, helped... And I... have I seen you somewhere before?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_504"><text>Of course you have — you sent me to the scientists in the Ivankovsky District Center, remember? Though you were barely speaking then. And now too.\nOr do you think we met earlier? Do you know who I am?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_505"><text>No... I don't understand myself. You reminded me of someone... well, anyway... That can't be... You can't be him...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_506"><text>I see. You're rambling again. You still don't look too good...\nAbout the information Strelok shared with you. You said we'd talk about it later. So what was it and where from?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_507"><text>I don't know exactly where from. There was all sorts... Diagrams, plans, blueprints, maps. Looks like it all came from some underground complex. I shared something with him too... Materials from my work... I wanted to understand... I thought zombies came from the "Brain Scorcher"... But the "Brain Scorcher" is gone, and there are new zombies... Even more... So it was all for nothing...\nStrelok said... the Monolith emits something, that's why there are zombies and psy...chic... disor...ders. I didn't believe him... Thought it was fairy tales... The Monolith and its call... Thought it was some illness... But he said the field of "apathy" overla...ys... the "Brain Scorcher"... Deliberately so. I realized on myself that it was true... Barely got away... Hard...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_508"><text>You got lucky. Don't worry so much, you start slurring your words.\nBetter not get distracted — let's talk about Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_509"><text>At our last meeting... he left me notes... of a completely different kind. So that I would understand why... I gave everything to the Doctor... In case I didn't make it... It's all there. Why it's on... And why it must not be turned off. I thought it was a mistake... He said something about modulation... That it doesn't let it... And now... Anyway, it absolutely has to be turned on... Even if not in that, then in another modu...lation...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_510"><text>If only I knew how to do that. Fedotov, the head guy from the Ivankovsky District Center, told me there's a control post on Radar. But it turns out it's not where I was, in another place. Where did you shut the installation down?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_511"><text>On Radar. From the fork on the road north... Until you run into the slope of a hill... There's an airlock there... But I didn't shut it down... Stayed outside... Monitored the radiation level on the instruments... Guys from my group shut it down... They all stayed there... Now there's no power. And the doors are blo...cked... Probably on purpose... Or by mistake... But there must be a backup... power source for sure.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_512"><text>Fedotov also mentioned some underground base in Dark Valley. The staff from the "Rainbow" supposedly lived there and, possibly, some of the complex systems were controlled from there.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_513"><text>Among Strelok's papers... there was something about that... Find the Doctor... Read them... He headed to the Foggy Thicket from me.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_514"><text>I've been looking to meet him myself for a long time. He promised to let me know when we could see each other, but so far, nothing. The Thicket, you say? I'll try to find him there myself. Get better.</text></string>
<string id="tex_radar_on_go_aver_article"><text>Some things are starting to become clearer regarding the "Rainbow", but for the full picture I need to talk to the Doctor and take Strelok's papers from him. Ivar said that Doc visited him in the Bar quite recently, after which he headed to the Foggy Thicket.</text></string>

<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_601"><text>Marked One? Finally... Have you been to the Doctor? Got the papers?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_6021"><text>Yes — the answer to both questions. Why are you so worked up?\nListen, I can't wrap my head around this... Is it really true? Everything that's written there... About the Monolith, about the madmen.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_6022"><text>It's me. I don't have time now, I'll come back later.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_603"><text>I first took it for... fantasy myself. But compared things... It matches too well. We need to turn the "Brain Scorcher" back on... That's why I'm worried — right now you're the only one... who can do it... It's important that you believe...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_604"><text>Alright, let's say I turn the installation on, and then what? The field of powerlessness will stop spreading, but the "fragment carriers" will remain. That means it won't solve the main problem, it'll only delay it. Break through to the Monolith? And then what? And how do you even get to it, if even Strelok couldn't? Or did he manage after all?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_605"><text>Ghost, Strelok's closest associate... I think he might know... Or suspect. They talked a lot with Strelok... but for some reason nothing worked out for Strelok... And you have a chance. At least, that's how it seems to me...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_606"><text>This Ghost... First he still needs to be found and persuaded to tell what he knows about all this.\nAnd in general, if you think about it: do I even need this? Did I sign up to be some hero-savior of humanity, to storm the CNPP, or wherever that Monolith is? And it's funny to say — there I am, standing before the Monolith, which isn't even material, if you believe the notes, but just a projection... How do you make it stop affecting our world? Nooo, turning the installation on — that at least makes some sense why it's done, but after that...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_607"><text>Let it be like that for now... Turn it on first... Then, maybe, your own motive will appear... To look for the Monolith... And then we'll see...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_608"><text>We'll see... as usual. Alright, I'll sort through the papers and plan how to pull this off.</text></string>

<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_701"><text>What's going on with the "Brain Scorcher", Marked One? Any progress?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_702"><text>Not yet. Working on it. Don't get nervous, most important thing — it's bad for you. I think it'll work out.</text></string>

<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_801"><text>What's going on with the "Brain Scorcher", Marked One? Any progress?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_802"><text>By all accounts, it looks like I managed to start it, but there's no full certainty yet. Time will tell.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_803"><text>The main thing is that you did it. Not even for everyone, but for yourself personally.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_804"><text>Personally... probably. I've still got business in the Zone, after all. Didn't want to get wiped out on some next run because of all those apathy fields.\nAnd you, I see, have come to your senses. Almost lively. Listen, Ivar, I've been meaning to ask for a long time: why does your group have such a name — "Seekers"? What are you looking for, if it's not a secret?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_805"><text>We are looking for ways to return zom... zom...bified and those obsessed with the Monolith fragment to a normal state. Sorry, my speech function hasn't fully recovered yet, so I pronounce some words poorly.\nAt first I used purely medi...cal methods, but quickly realized they don't help. Then I switched to searching for artifacts with special properties... That's when my first "followers" appeared. But here too we failed. Then I started considering the option of shutting down the "Rainbow". It was quite a long stage. Many left the group, only the most steadfast remained. And, well, you know the result... Almost everyone died. And that's my fault. But, as pompous as it may sound, I am obliged to continue, obliged to succeed, so that their deaths were not in vain.</text></string>
<!-- Êëûê ãäå-òî -->
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8081"><text>A worthy cause. All I can do is wish you good luck. But aren't the zombified just empty walking shells? In Strelok's notes it was said that the Monolith "empties" them and "absorbs the soul", whatever that is supposed to mean.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8091"><text>Maybe that's how it is. Some even justify their vile experiments with that. Saying it's the same as dissec... ting a corpse. But from a purely medical point of view, they still remain living people. And I think it's possible to somehow make the Monolith reject their absorbed... mind? Essence? Soul? Call it what you like. And then it will return to the empty shell.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8101"><text>There's probably something to that... Alright, it's time for me to go.</text></string>

You took a big risk with the "Brain Scorcher"...\nWhen I was heading back from Radar, I dropped part of my gear in the forest... where there's a hole in the fence... a big tree by the cliff ... there's a backpack there.\nIt was hard to carry it... there's plenty of wildlife all around. If you find it — it's yours. If not — sorry, I can't give you anything else for now.</text></string>

<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8102"><text>There's probably something to it... I was just thinking here... Did you know Fang?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8112"><text>I did. What does Fang have to do with it?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8122"><text>He had a similar problem... As far as I know, he fell under the influence of a controller. The Doctor saved him and brought him to... a secluded place. It's in the undergrounds beneath the Agroprom Research Institute. That's where I met him. If he tried to get to the surface, he immediately became, well, like a zombie — exactly so. But as long as he stayed underground, he seemed normal.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8132"><text>You say "became", "was"... What happened to him? Did he recover?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8142"><text>Sakharov made some kind of special protective helmet. I brought it to Fang and he was able to go up to the surface wearing it. Sakharov suggested that a helicopter pick him up at Agroprom and take him somewhere they could help him, but I had my doubts...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8152"><text>So did he make it out or not?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8162"><text>He did, but to a different place. It's a long story. Right now he's in the Foggy Thicket, basically. And now I'm thinking whether I did the right thing arranging it all like that. Who's going to help him in that thicket now? He could've been under the supervision of doctors and scientists...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8172"><text>No! Anything but those scientists! You'd have just delivered them a new test... subject. Do you really think they would've treated him? Like hell they would! More likely, they'd try to make sure Fang stayed half-zombified for as long as possible. To thoroughly study, for example, how his body reacts to ther... mal burns, or puncture wounds, or severe dehydration... After they'd had their "fun" with physiology, they'd move on to the psyche. And then they'd really go all out, you can believe me. Of course, all for noble goals. "One innocent sacrifice to save thousands" and all that kind of crap. Pfah, hypocrites! In short, you did everything right, don't doubt it...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8182"><text>Hey, calm down! You can't go on like that. You really worked yourself up. In any case, I wanted to ask you to visit Fang in the thicket. You're probably the best specialist in this field in the entire Zone right now.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8192"><text>Of course, I'll go see him. Even if I didn't know him, it would be my medical duty. As soon as I fully recover and regain my strength, I'll head out right away. Where should I look for him?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_8202"><text>Find the Doctor. He'll tell you the details and guide you to the shelter where Fang lives. And now it's time for me to go. We'll see each other again.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_start_new_dialog_901"><text>Hello, my friend.</text></string>
