<string id="doctor_dialog_start_101"><text>Greetings... How are you feeling?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_dialog_start_102"><text>I've got no strength left, I'm stumbling... Who are you? And who am I?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_dialog_start_103"><text>You didn't recognize me? That's a pity, I was hoping you would.\nI am the Doctor—many call me the Swamp Doctor, as I used to live in the swamps... I heard they found you and came to take a look. As for who you are... I'm not sure yet, you've taken quite a beating. I have a hunch, but it's too incredible. Until you remember for yourself, I won't say; there is too much danger that you'll build a personality around a name that isn't yours. For now, just relax... Perhaps you'll meet someone you know—memory loss often requires an external jolt.\nGo, talk to Sidorovich; he was nursing you back to health while I was away. As for me, I'll head slowly toward the center of the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_dialog_start_104"><text>Doctor? I don't remember... Sidorovich? Where, what... Ugh... my head...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_dialog_start_105"><text>Take a medkit, eat something, drink some water. It'll perk you up.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_dialog_start_106"><text>Ah... thanks.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_dialog_start_201"><text>I see you've recovered a bit. Anything come back to you yet?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_dialog_start_202"><text>No, I haven't remembered... I'll look for those who can help.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_dialog_start_203"><text>Right then! We'll meet again...</text></string>

<string id="wolf_document"><text>Find the document for Wolf</text></string>
<string id="esc_wounded_flash"><text>Find Nimble and his flash drive</text></string>

<string id="esc_lager_no_talk_101"><text>Pal, you should get out of here. If you don't go willingly, we'll help you along as best we can.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_no_talk_102"><text>What's gotten into you guys?</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_no_talk_201"><text>Hey! What do you want?</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_no_talk_202"><text>Hello!</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_no_talk_301"><text>Our leader wanted to see you. But that doesn't mean you're welcome here. Keep moving, don't loiter.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_no_talk_401"><text>Get lost, we're all gonna go up in smoke because of you.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_no_talk_402"><text>Don't sweat it, you'll fight 'em off.</text></string>

<string id="esc_provodnik_start_101"><text>Hello, stalker. Hm, life's certainly taken its toll on you. You here to see me? People call me Guide, what should I call you?</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_102"><text>Same to you. I'm the Marked One. Haven't heard of me?</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_103"><text>Marked One... I think I've heard you've been stirring up quite a ruckus. What did you want from me? You seem pretty resourceful yourself.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_104"><text>I'm looking for Strelok. Ever heard of him? Word is, you had a photograph. One with this Strelok in it.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_1041"><text>Maybe I did... You are a guide, after all.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_1051"><text>Yeah, and I'm not a loner. How about you stop pulling the pseudo-cat by its pseudo-tail and get straight to the point...</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_105"><text>About Strelok? Course I have. Who hasn't? About a year ago he caused a lot of noise up north. Plenty of folks would love to have a word with him. He was lucky. Or so they say...\nAs for the photo...\nI didn't even know it was Strelok and his crew. Found it by chance. Took it off a dead man in the Red Forest.\nAnother stalker told me it was Strelok, Ghost, and a couple of other guys.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_106"><text>Can I take a look at it?</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_107"><text>Eh... I don't have it anymore. Doctor was here recently; I showed it to him and he went and asked for it for keeps. Said he wanted to show it to someone himself. What do I need it for anyway?\nHe set me up with a bottle for my health.\nThen he waddled off. Said he was going to visit a friend, supposedly in the Agroprom underground. What the hell he's looking for there is beyond me! If you really need to know, I can show you the way...\nIf you don't mind parting with a Tier 2 artifact, I'll tell you about a direct path from here straight to Agroprom. Save you a lot of time. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_1081"><text>Don't have one on me. Maybe later.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_1082"><text>Is that the path through the Settlement? I already know that one.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_1091"><text>Suit yourself.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_1092"><text>That's the one. Well, since you already know it, don't bring it up again.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_151"><text>Hey, friend... How's it going? Not seeing double yet? Fancy a glass, or are you trying to find out something important again?</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_152"><text>I'm trying, I'm trying... It's just that all my attempts seem to be going sideways.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_153"><text>Just take a breather, man. Relax. You'll see, things will turn the right way eventually.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_201"><text>Greetings, Marked One. How are you holding up?</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_202"><text>Fine for now. About that direct path to Agroprom.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_203"><text>Didn't we already agree? No? A Tier 2 artifact and I'll map out a safe trail for you.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_2041"><text>I've got an artifact, here you go.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_2042"><text>I've got an even better one, here.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_205"><text>I appreciate it... Now listen close. There's a direct path to Agroprom. Cross the road and head past the farm, go beyond the tunnel under the railway, and you'll see two boulders. Behind them is a collapsed wire fence. Go through that and follow the untrodden trail straight to the Forgotten Village; from there, it's just a few steps to Agroprom. Good luck to you.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_2051"><text>By the way, do you happen to know anything interesting about Strelok's group or its stash?</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_2052"><text>Nah... Just heard various tales out of the corner of my ear... you know how people talk. As for the stash, all I know is that it exists, Doctor himself let it slip... if he wasn't pulling my leg, that is. Hm... come to think of it, maybe that's where he's meeting his friend?!</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_206"><text>Anything's possible. Alright, since you don't know anything else about Strelok and his crew, I'll be going...</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_207"><text>Alright then, watch your step out there.</text></string>
<string id="esc_provodnik_start_301"><text>Healthy? Good to see it. I was starting to have my doubts.</text></string>
<!-- Ïåòðóõà -->
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_101"><text>Hey there, buddy. Wolf already gave us the heads-up. You got any more questions for me?</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_102"><text>What's the situation? Where's Nimble? What's the plan?</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_103"><text>The Bandits kidnapped Nimble. They didn't scrap him right away, they're shaking him down for something. Seems they want something from him. So, we're gonna try and knock the sense out of those punks... You with me?</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_104"><text>Think we can talk to them? Seems to me if the lead starts flying, they'll finish Nimble off instantly!</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_105"><text>They're just thugs! You can't reason with 'em, you'll just catch a bullet for your trouble... We'll try to pull this off fast so they don't even have time to scratch their heads. Get it?</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_106"><text>Yeah. How many bandits are in the camp?</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_107"><text>Seven or eight guys. Two near the gates, two in the right building by the fire, and two in the building on the left, that's where they're holding Nimble. Someone usually wanders around the yard too... that's about it. So, shall we get to it, God willing?</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_1071"><text>Let's do it. Get your boys ready.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_1072"><text>No. I'll try to handle it myself to keep things quiet.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_1082"><text>Suit yourself. If things go south, just holler... Rambo.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_1073"><text>Seven or eight?! That's a suicide mission! We need another way...</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_1083"><text>Listen here, wise guy! What do you suggest? Sitting in the bushes and admiring the sky?</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_109"><text>Well... Sidorovich mentioned something about having ties with the military? I don't know... I just don't think we'll save Nimble with a frontal assault.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_1091"><text>I get it! But what are we supposed to do?\nFine, go back and talk to Wolf. I don't want to discuss this stuff over the radio. Maybe he can organize some support or something...</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_1101"><text>Yeah, I think that would be for the best.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_1102"><text>Hm... Let me try to do something quietly. Alone.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_1092"><text>I get it! But what are we supposed to do?\nWolf is dead, and Sidor couldn't care less about people...</text></string>

<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_201"><text>Well? Did you go? What's the verdict?</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_2011"><text>We haven't come up with anything yet...</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_2012"><text>What else... we gotta storm the place, that's what!</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_2020"><text>Ha! Exactly what I said! So, shall we? The boys and I will try to create a distraction from the right, and you flank them from the left...</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_2013"><text>Yeah, I talked to him. Basically, I'm gonna try to find that PDA the bandits are after myself. I'm heading to the Gut.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_20131"><text>The hunters there demand a toll for passage, you got any? Here, take this pseudodog tail; give it to them if they ask. They'll let you through no questions asked. Just don't loiter near the ATP! Give it a wide berth!</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_20132"><text>Right, got it, I'll keep my distance. I'm off.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_20133"><text>You told me already! Now get a move on! Make up your mind—how and what we're doing!</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_20134"><text>It's... my head isn't quite right... Anyway, I'm off.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_2014"><text>I'll try to negotiate. I'm going in unarmed...</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_20141"><text>Are you crazy?! Look... they'll smoke you! You sick in the head or something?</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_20142"><text>We'll see. Just back me up if things go south...</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_2015"><text>I spoke with Nimble. They're demanding some gadget from him. I'm gonna go consult with Wolf.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_20151"><text>Just don't drag this out too long! We'll wait half a day at most. If we don't hear from you by then, we're gonna give those bastards some hell!</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_20152"><text>I understand, I'll try to make it quick...</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_2016"><text>It's all sorted. The bandits let Nimble go and they're moving out.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_20161"><text>Damn, you're a real ace! I didn't think you had it in you to settle it like that... Seriously—you've got my respect, Marked One! Swing by sometime and we'll have a drink.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_20162"><text>I'll drop in. If I get the chance.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_2017"><text>I Found some kind of PDA, I'm gonna go show them. Keep your eyes peeled, we might have to fight our way out.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_20171"><text>Don't you worry! We've got your back.</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_20172"><text>I hope so...</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_2018"><text>Wolf is dead, I don't know what to do...</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_301"><text>Damn... we couldn't save Nimble. But at least we took those freaks down.\nSo, what about you, Marked One? How are you holding up?\nIf I ask you for a favor, think you could help me out?</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_401"><text>That was one hell of a firefight... I reckon Wolf will be pleased.\nThink you could help me out with one more thing?</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_402"><text>Wolf? You, uh, hold your horses on the favors... I need to talk to Wolf first!</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_501"><text>We haven't got 'em all yet! Find those bastards and take them out!</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_601"><text>Man, you're a real ace! I didn't expect that from you. Settling it like that... Well, bottom line, you've got my respect, Marked One!\nThink you could help me out with something else?</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_701"><text>So where are the piles of fallen enemies? Typical! You're all talk and no action... Get lost!</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_801"><text>Hey, Marked One. How's life treating you...</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_901"><text>Oh... Who are you? Ah! Whatever... What do you want? Think you can help me?</text></string>
<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_931"><text>Ah, it's you... What do you want? Gonna help, or what? If not, just keep on walking.</text></string>

<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_101"><text>Hold it right there, stalker! No one in the camp is gonna talk to you right now.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_1021"><text>Why not?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_1022"><text>Fine, have it your way.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_103"><text>You'd have to be a complete idiot to shoot the breeze with a passenger from a Death Truck! You go prove you're worth dealing with first.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_1041"><text>What Death Truck? I don't remember anything... nothing at all.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_1051"><text>Hell if I know... but they're nasty business, not much in this world is worse than those...\nAnyway, I shouldn't be talking about this with you! Call me superstitious, but you'd better beat it right now, pal, while we're still being nice about it.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_1042"><text>What do I have to do to make you guys trust me?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_1052"><text>Let Sidorovich vet you while we keep an eye out. If you're a straight shooter, don't go waving your gun around for no reason, and generally have a head on your shoulders, we'll find common ground eventually. Don't sweat it.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_201"><text>Hey, Marked One. What do you need?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_301"><text>Our leader wanted to see you. But that doesn't mean you're welcome here. Head on in, and don't linger.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_401"><text>Get lost before our boys knock some teeth out, you moron!</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_402"><text>What the hell! You lose your mind? Looking for a fat lip?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_403"><text>We told you, don't touch the military! But no! You had to go and do it... Now life's gonna be hell for everyone!</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_404"><text>Chill out, rookie...</text></string>
<!-- Ôàíàò -->
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_101"><text>Listen, Marked One, talk about good timing! Wolf said you're a tough nut to crack. We could really use your skills right about now.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_102"><text>What's happened? and who are you, exactly?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_103"><text>I'm Fanatic. I'm in charge here now that Wolf's gone. Yesterday, a few guys showed up, looked like bandits, but serious types, d-damn it... They came and laid it on thick: said we have one day to clear out of the camp, that this is their base now. They're supposed to come back today, and as you can guess, it won't end with just talk this time.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_104"><text>So, what have you decided to do?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_105"><text>We've decided to set an ambush, because I'm afraid we won't hold out in a head-on fight. The ones who came were well-equipped, and you could tell they know which end of a gun to hold... And here—I've got mostly kids. Anyway, we decided to hunker down quietly in the houses, make it look like we left, and attack when the moment is right. We're desperate for fighters like you right now. We'll settle up afterward, don't you worry! So, will you help?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_106"><text>It's all very strange. Why would anyone want this half-ruined village on the edge of the Zone, especially right under the military's nose? Seems to me it was just an excuse to start trouble... they're looking for something, or someone.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_107"><text>Oh, maybe you know why? You're a pretty shady character yourself, from what I see... No one really knows where you came from, and you either don't remember or you're playing dumb... I'm not sure I like this. No one touched this pond until you showed up!</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_108"><text>You what?! Who do you take me for? Does the fact that I've been breaking my back for Sidor, doing jobs for Wolf, and helping out stalkers not count? I'm curious myself as to why they showed up...</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_109"><text>Alright, sorry... just the stress talking. I don't get the point of this uninvited visit myself. So, will you help us?</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_1091"><text>I'll help.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_1092"><text>No, I've got enough of my own headaches. Figure it out yourselves.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_110"><text>I suggest we spend the remaining time preparing for the fight. Here's the plan: I'll send the greenest rookies to hide in the houses and cellars with orders not to show their faces, or the boys will get slaughtered for nothing... You, me, and a couple of the more experienced guys will take up positions with good firing lines around the campfire. As soon as they reach the fire, we let 'em have it from all sides! They'll be coming from the direction of the bridge... soon, I think. So, find some cover with a good view, and we'll start on my signal. I mean, it's up to you, obviously—but I think there's little chance of surviving out in the open. You decide.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_111"><text>Alright.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_121"><text>Yeah, I figured as much, you don't care about anything or anyone but your own skin. Guess we'll have to manage on our own then... What are you still standing there for? Beat it.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_201"><text>We're just waiting for these fine gentlemen. I have a feeling they'll be here any minute.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_202"><text>I'm ready.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_301"><text>You're a terrifying man, Marked One! Remind me never to get on your bad side. You handled that brilliantly! And those bastards weren't exactly born yesterday either—they had the sense to enter the village from two directions at once.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_302"><text>Yeah. Consider ourselves lucky we got off easy.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_303"><text>Here, take a couple of artifacts and some ammo as a souvenir from us. Shake on it! If you ever need anything, come by and we'll talk.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_401"><text>Hey, Marked One, good to see you!</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_4021"><text>Hello to you too.</text></string>

<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_4031"><text>Good to shake hands. Heh.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_4032"><text>He got some kind of message from a passing stalker recently. He packed up immediately, grabbed a crate of dynamite, and headed for the Warehouses. I was just recovering from a wound, so he asked me to keep an eye on the rookies.</text></string>
<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_501"><text>Roll on out of here, man! Always people wandering around...</text></string>

<string id="escape_shustryi_start_102"><text>But I do. I need the flash drive you were carrying for the trader. I'm here on his behalf. Do you have it on you?</text></string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_start_103"><text>You bet! You saved my life, after all, so no questions asked, take it. These idiots don't even know how to search a man properly, and I'm an expert at hiding valuables.</text></string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_start_104"><text>Hm... and where were you keeping it, if you don't mind me asking? You never know, might come in handy someday.</text></string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_start_105"><text>Not below the belt, don't worry. I've been in the courier business a long time and I've got my professional secrets, so sorry—can't share those.\nAnyway, I'm heading back to camp. Although, I'd better stay out of Sidor's sight for a while—he'll chew me out for sure. Why the hell did I decide to stop by that sawmill...</text></string>
<string id="escape_shustryi_start_201"><text>May your roads be like velvet, stalker!</text></string>

<string id="sidor_agro_quest_start_dlg_0"><text>Sidorovich, you called for me?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_start_dlg_1"><text>Marked One, I’ve been doing some thinking in my spare time and I want to offer you something... In the grand scheme of things, you need to find this Strelok person, right?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_start_dlg_2"><text>Let's say I do.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_start_dlg_3"><text>Well, I've found out a few things about Strelok. There really is such a stalker. Was, at least—there hasn't been a peep out of him for months. They say he found a way to the north of the Zone. Untouched territory, a real Klondike... m-hm...\nBasically, I'll help you track him down, but as you can imagine, it’s not just out of the goodness of my heart. You'll have to earn it. On the bright side, everyone wins: you deal with your Strelok business and find out what happened to you, and I'll find... well, I mean, I’ll gain something from our cooperation. Eh? Deal?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_start_dlg_4"><text>Keep going, I'm listening.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_start_dlg_5"><text>You’re a serious man, I can tell. We need people like you.\nMe and the other traders are conducting an investigation. We want to find a path north, to the center of the Zone, but something or someone is blocking the way. God knows how your Strelok managed to slip through... You see, there's a place up there where your brains just boil. Nasty stuff... m-hm... But to the point. Recently, a rumor started that some important documents fell into military hands. In fact, they’ve been showing some unhealthy activity around Agroprom lately. It’s possible the two are directly related, or maybe it’s just a coincidence. Word is those documents contain info on how to safely bypass the "brain-scrambling" area. So: everything the military has dug up is currently stored in the main building of the research institute. Guarded, of course—goes without saying... but we really need it. Do you catch my drift?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_start_dlg_6"><text>Not quite. You want me to go storm a guarded military facility based on some vague hunch of yours? Have you lost your damn mind, "esteemed" sir?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_start_dlg_7"><text>You're joking, I'm laughing. Don't go twisting my words! Who said anything about "storming"? I’m telling you that we need to find out as much detail as possible about this whole business with the documents and the suspicious military activity. Of course, getting the documents themselves would be ideal, but I’m a realist... So, I suggest you just head to Agroprom for starters and look around.\nBy the way, a few soldiers from over there came by the other day asking for vodka. They mentioned that a couple of boys deserted recently. Supposedly they're holed up not far from the base, out in the swamp. Try to get the full story out of them. Clearer now?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_start_dlg_8"><text>Clearer. Talk to the deserters, see what's what.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_start_dlg_9"><text>Exactly! Well, if you suddenly manage to get your hands on something tangible by any means, make sure you bring it straight to me.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_start_dlg_10"><text>Alright.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_start_dlg_11"><text>I'll upload the coordinates and the necessary info to your PDA. To put it simply: head north through the Garbage, then turn west; after a couple of kilometers, you'll come right out at Agroprom. By the way, there are more artifacts in the Garbage than here, but the radiation there is off the charts in some spots. So, I'd suggest buying some antirad or vodka from me. Otherwise, you'll be glowing like a Christmas tree... heh-heh. Just a little joke! Anyway, good luck.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_0"><text>I want to talk about your assignment to head over to Agroprom.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_1"><text>I'm all ears. Did you find out about the documents or what?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_21"><text>Yeah, I found out. But first things first. I met a soldier there, one of the deserters you mentioned. He told me the military is planning to sweep the Agroprom outskirts. They're bringing in some kind of commission at the end of the summer, world-renowned scientists and all that. That's why there's such a noticeable ruckus.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_22"><text>I found a photo album. That draftee I told you about used it to hide the papers you're so interested in. He tucked the sheets between the photos, so everything is safe and sound, even though it's been sitting in the damp... in a cellar. Here, take it.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_23"><text>I haven't had the chance yet. Actually, I think I was poorly prepared. I need to stock up on gear first.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_31"><text>Blast it all! That's bad news. I'll need to put out a warning over the stalker network. Well, what about the documents?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_33"><text>Ekh, Marked One... Fine, have a look, take your pick. Your money, our goods.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_4"><text>I managed to find out the following. Somewhere near Agroprom, the military gunned down a couple of stalks coming from the Gut. They had a briefcase full of scientific papers. I suspect that briefcase is out of reach now, or maybe they've already shipped it out of the Zone. But one rookie managed to swipe a few pages from that briefcase and hide them later...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_5"><text>I see, I see. And? I'd be very curious to have a look at them.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_61"><text>I bet you are... This album belonged to the draftee who swiped the papers you're so interested in. He tucked the stolen goods between the photos, so everything is safe and sound, even though it's been sitting in the damp... in a certain cellar. Here, take it.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_62"><text>I'm working on that right now. They're hidden in a real nasty spot. I'll drop by later.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_7"><text>Hm... yes, interesting. Not quite what I was hoping for, but still. I'll need to sit down and mull this all over. You can go for now. Oh, and take this album back with you, I don't need the extra scrap paper, I've got nowhere to put it as it is.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_8"><text>Wait... what, just "go" like that? I risked my life getting those scribbles for you, for your information!</text></string>
<string id="sidor_agro_quest_done_dlg_9"><text>Alright, stop whining. Take this as a token of my gratitude. Since you're such a tough guy and managed to handle this assignment, head over to the Bar. The trader there—Barkeep—could also use the help of a capable stalker. I'll give him a heads-up and signal the Duty guys at the checkpoint just in case, so they let you through without any trouble.\nOne more thing. If you happen to come across any other documents like these, bring them to me. I'll pay well. Now get going, I need to think.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_bp_case_start_dlg_0"><text>Sidorovich, I got your message. What kind of business has cropped up?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_start_dlg_1"><text>More like a problem... Here's the deal. The new commander of the security battalion wants to replace the entire old command staff. He doesn't like the fact that we've found common ground with them. This bastard—rot his soul—has gathered some "facts": various financial documents, photographs, and the like. He plans to hand all this over to the military prosecutor's office. To keep anyone from getting suspicious, he sent all the current officers to the Dark Valley to butt heads with Borov’s gang. Whoever stays alive and returns will be arrested on the spot. This could end badly for me... and for other stalkers too. It'll be hard to get certain goods, and smuggling loot will become much more difficult.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_start_dlg_2"><text>Don't feed me that crap, okay? It'll be harder for you, not the stalkers.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_start_dlg_3"><text>Fine, have it your way. Satisfied? Look, Marked One, you scratch my back, I scratch yours! I've got info from a contact of mine on how to help you with your memory. See? I’m looking out for you, I haven't forgotten—so you don't forget either. If this all pans out, I'll tell you how to meet him. I think you two can reach an agreement... So, how about it?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_start_dlg_4"><text>Quit beating around the bush already. What specifically do you want from me?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_start_dlg_5"><text>All the blackmail material is currently stored at the checkpoint. Right now, an officer loyal to the new commander is on duty there with his goons. We need to get that damn suitcase of documents. I've done some recon... the soldiers there still remember my generosity. Obviously, storming the checkpoint isn't an option. Plus, there's an APC right at the entrance. Even if you swipe the case quietly, they'll make life hell for everyone. The military will shake everyone down and smoke us out of here while they're at it.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_start_dlg_6"><text>So what’s the plan then?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_start_dlg_7"><text>You can't just pull the documents out of the suitcase, it’s locked with a combination. Our good friend Kuznetsov has an idea: if we could find an identical case and swap it on the sly. That way, we can frame the battalion commander himself while we stay above suspicion. Let him deal with his own mess. Anyway, Kuznetsov suggests trying to find the same kind of case. This commander must have gotten it from somewhere here in the Zone; one of the local stalker craftsmen made it. And how many of those are there? You can count them on one hand. Try to find out. Start with Vergas, maybe he can give you a lead. But you've got to resolve this quickly. We have four days at most. After that, a scheduled chopper arrives with supplies for the military, and they'll use it to ferry the case back to the mainland.\nHere, look... this is a photo of the suitcase. I'm uploading it to your PDA. If you find one like it, rush straight back to me. I'll manage to strike a deal with one of the conscripts to organize the swap. You'll just need to drop the case off at the specified time and place.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_start_dlg_81"><text>I'll see what I can do.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_start_dlg_82"><text>You know, I think I'll pass. I have no desire to get caught in the middle of a military squabble. If things go south, you'll wiggle your way out somehow, but if they find out I was involved—I'm a dead man.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_start_dlg_91"><text>Marked One, drop everything else, this is vital. And I'll make it worth your while. I'll tell you about my contact and throw in something for the road. If you solve this suitcase business, then Kuznetsov will be give you a bi-i-ig thank you when he returns, I'm sure of it. Remember— we only have four days, but I'll be waiting for you right here until the swap is done. Just don't come barging in at night; my sleep is sacred.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_bp_case_start_dlg_92"><text>And I was really counting on you, Marked One...</text></string>

<string id="tex_blockpost_case_article"><text>Sidorovich is asking me to find a similar briefcase. To start, I need to ask Vergas which of the repairmen is capable of making such a thing.</text></string>
<string id="escape_trader_jobs_50"><text>A bit of a problem has cropped up... The new commander of the security battalion wants to replace the entire old command staff.

<string id="sidor_dumenko_case_start_0"><text>Hey, Sidorovich! I've got a certain briefcase here with documents from that destroyed convoy rusting away in the Gut. You usually have an interest in this kind of stuff...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dumenko_case_start_1"><text>Oho, that's a real stroke of luck! How did you even manage to get it... Actually, never mind. Hand it over!</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dumenko_case_start_2"><text>Not so fast. I'm supposed to deliver this to a... client. He'll be very, very upset if I don't bring him this case. Besides, it looks like he knows exactly what's inside and will notice if anything's missing. Something tells me I won't live long if that happens.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dumenko_case_start_3"><text>Is that so... Well, what if I borrow it from you for just ten minutes? I've got a camera; I'll snap photos of everything real quick.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dumenko_case_start_31"><text>It's risky, of course... what if he figures out it was tampered with? Fine, I'll find a way to talk my way out of it. I'll leave you to it; I'm going to get some fresh air.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dumenko_case_start_32"><text>You know, I think I've changed my mind... What if the client gets pissed that the locks were messed with? Let's just pretend this conversation never happened.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_dumenko_case_done_0"><text>So, how's the photoshoot going? Finished yet?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dumenko_case_done_11"><text>Look at you, getting all impatient. Fine, I've snapped the most interesting bits. Just sealing your suitcase back up now... Here, take it.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dumenko_case_done_12"><text>Don't you have a watch? Stop distracting me...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dumenko_case_done_2"><text>What about the payment?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dumenko_case_done_3"><text>I'll transfer some credits to you now, and here—take these supplies... Oh, right! In the papers from your case, I found a recipe for the Thorn artifact; copy it down for yourself. Just don't ask me how it got in there... Anyway, are we even? Here, take a bottle too; have a drink and relax. You're looking a bit jumpy. Watch those nerves!</text></string>

<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_201"><text>Oh, Marked One! What brings you here?</text></string>
<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_2021"><text>Just passing through. How are you holding up?</text></string>
<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_2031"><text>Just living day by day, can't complain.</text></string>
<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_2022"><text>I see you've settled in a new spot. What about the village?</text></string>
<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_2032"><text>To hell with them—Fanatic and Sidor both. They worked us to the bone. This isn't right, that isn't good enough... always nitpicking. I got fed up and we moved here. We earn our own keep now, don't owe anyone a thing.</text></string>
<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_204"><text>And how do you survive? At least in the village you won't starve to death.</text></string>
<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_205"><text>Yeah right, they toss you a bone like a dog and then run you ragged all day. Believe me, sometimes there isn't even time to sit by the fire and just talk about life with the guys.\nWe'll be fine here. Something always turns up. Besides, the world isn't without kind people.</text></string>
<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_206"><text>You'd be better off doing some real work, hunting artifacts instead of asking for handouts. You won't survive on charity alone.</text></string>
<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_207"><text>I was speaking figuratively. Actually, we go out hunting for arts after every Blowout, and we even make raids to the Garbage. I wouldn't say we're incredibly lucky, but it's enough for bread and ammo. We're even saving up a bit. It's about time to move to the Bar, but we lack decent gear. I still haven't saved enough for a bulletproof vest. Going deep into the Zone without one is a death wish. But it's only a matter of time.</text></string>
<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_208"><text>The main thing is you're keeping your head up and becoming a real stalker.</text></string>

<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_302"><text>What happened anyway?</text></string>
<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_303"><text>Three of us were coming back from a sortie and we ran right into some bandits. One of ours was taken out instantly. Vitalya, the idiot, tried to run for it—flew straight into an anomaly... with all the loot! I got grazed by some buckshot; lucky for me they were shooting from a distance. I played dead and just lay there waiting for the thugs to clear out. They went through my whole backpack, but there wasn't anything in there. They grumbled a bit and headed off toward the ATP. That's when you showed up.</text></string>
<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_304"><text>Headed toward the ATP, huh? And what are you going to do now? Can you make it back to camp on your own?</text></string>
<string id="tutorial_wounded_give_medkit_305"><text>Sure, it's just a stone's throw away, and the painkillers have already kicked in. I'll be in the village licking my wounds for a while, then we'll see. Sorry I've got nothing to give you as a reward, but I'll be sure to tell everyone that you helped me!\nMaybe... oh, never mind...</text></string>
