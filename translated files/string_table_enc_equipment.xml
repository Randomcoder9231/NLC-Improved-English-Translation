<string id="enc_detector_advances"><text>A device that detects the presence of certain types of anomaly fields and reports them with an audio signal of varying intensity depending on the distance to the object. Has a built-in Geiger counter. To operate, it must be activated by placing the device on a belt or in a pocket on the rig.</text></string>
<string id="enc_detector_elite"><text>This device was invented by scientists in the Zone. It detects the presence of most types of anomaly fields, reporting them with an audio signal of varying intensity depending on the distance to the object. It can also visually display the location of anomalies on the map. Has a built-in Geiger counter. To operate, it must be activated by placing the device on a belt or in a pocket on the rig.</text></string>
<string id="enc_detector_sakbuzz_elite"><text>A device made on the basis of a universal detector that determines the presence of almost all types of anomalies, including the "Fruit Punch" so hated by all stalkers, and reports them with an audio signal of varying intensity depending on the distance to the object. As in the original model, there is a map output capability. A Geiger counter is also included. To operate, it must be activated by placing the device on a belt or in a pocket on the rig.</text></string>
<string id="enc_detector_sakbuzz_simple"><text>A crudely assembled device for detecting "Fruit Punch" type anomalies. Alerts to the detection of an object using audio signals of varying intensity depending on the distance. Has a built-in Geiger counter. To operate, it must be activated by placing the device on a belt or in a pocket on the rig.</text></string>
<string id="detector_art_descr"><text>"Experimental Artifact Detector, Model 1".\nTheoretically, it determines the presence of "natural" artifacts of any kind within a radius of about 30 meters. It alerts the operator with an audio signal, the intensity of which changes depending on the distance to the target. Also has a built-in Geiger counter.\nNot designed for belt-wear. Simultaneous activation with other working detector devices may distort the instrument's readings.</text></string>
<string id="detector_art_upgr_descr"><text>"Experimental Artifact Detector, Model 2".\nA gift from Gluzov. Unlike the previous model, this device is equipped with a screen that displays all detected artifacts, which significantly facilitates the search. Furthermore, the device now reacts not only to natural artifacts, but also to those of artificial origin that are not stored in containers, backpacks, or other objects shielding them from scanning. Like the first model, in passive mode the device emits an audio signal signaling the detection of an artifact nearby.\nSimultaneous activation with other working detector devices may distort the instrument's readings.</text></string>

<string id="noghost_letter"><text>Shtyr's note</text></string>
<string id="enc_noghost_letter"><text>Hey! It's Shtyr. Stopped by Yantar on business. Well, Sakharov said you'd be here soon too. Decided to drop you a line. The Professor said he'd give it to you when you show up.\nWell, first about our business ... \n...\n  Oh! By the way! Sakharov says you're planning to crawl into some lab with Vasilyev? And Ghost is with you? Here's the thing: the other day I saw Guide at the Cordon, he's waiting for someone there. He had a photo with Ghost, Strelok, and a couple of other people. I think I know one of them, but I can't remember for the life of me, so ask Ghost when you get a chance who they're with. I have my suspicions...\nWell, take care. See ya. I'm heading off to Limansk, and then we'll see what happens...</text></string>
<string id="gen_mil_letter"><text>Post-mortem recording</text></string>
<string id="enc_gen_mil_letter"><text>Greetings to you, human... This is a post-mortem message from me, a simple researcher of the Zone's secrets. I know that I will die soon. It's strange to stay calm at a time like this, but so it is.\nI will describe everything that happened. To pass the time. To distract myself from thoughts of what awaits me.\nOur Research Institute received information that here, in the exclusion zone, phenomena are observed that could disprove the theory of relativity regarding the constancy of the direction of time. The Guide we were recommended assured the management that he knew a practically safe path to the place where this anomaly is observed.\nStrangely enough, we got here with the same group we started with. Ghost—that was the guide's name—really knew his business. Ghost. What pushed him to do this? Why? Was it all for the sake of the new emitter we received before leaving to test in field conditions?\nI don't know. I'll tell you what I saw.\nWe got here at dusk. We settled near this strange unit; it reminded me of something painfully familiar. But what? I decided to record the day's impressions and moved away from the overly noisy group of our escort behind this structure. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Ghost pull an artifact out of his backpack that he got from one of the stalkers we met. He did something with it, the artifact lit up... Then I got distracted, it seemed to me that one of the panels of the metal structure I was near had flipped open. That's what saved me... Saved... It sounds like a mockery now. A bright light illuminated everything around. There were no screams. In fact, it was very quiet. I passed out, probably. Probably. Otherwise, I cannot explain the fact that in the next second it was already day, the sun was shining. I had no records or weapons with me.\nThere was no pain either. And there isn't. But I can no longer feel anything below the waist. And the numbness is gradually rising higher. Apparently, the metal-like alloy of this structure shielded whatever caused this paralysis. Another oddity. I can still move my hands for now. I'll try to crawl to that container with the artifact I bartered from a trader in Limansk. He claimed that with its help, one could move through space... Stupid, of course. But what else is left... I'll try.\nIf it doesn't work, then... Why did Ghost need this? Why?</text></string>
