<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_101"><text>Thanks for the help, stalker! In a business like this, every barrel counts.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_102"><text>What was the beef between you and those guys?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_103"><text>If only I knew. Fox, Red and I were heading back from a raid, already counting the profit Sidorovich would shell out for the loot... Then these types jumped us, looked like mercenaries. Red tried to take cover behind some concrete slabs, but stepped right into the Fruit Punch. I had to draw them away. And here I am, over-distracted them, I guess. Good thing another group of stalkers was nearby and backed me up. As for Fox and Red — I don't even know what's with them.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_1041"><text>I met Fox at the Cordon. He says they had to leave Red right here in some tunnel. Doctor brewed a special medicine for him, I'm carrying it now, might make it in time to help.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_1042"><text>Fox is at the Cordon, he got hit pretty hard too. Said as soon as he's back on his feet, he'll head here to find Red. Red himself didn't go far, he's here, resting up in a tunnel. I brought him a special ointment from Doctor, so he's gonna pull through.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_1043"><text>Fox died at the Cordon. Haven't heard anything about Red.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_1044"><text>Man, what a mess. I haven't seen your friends. Hope they managed to get out of this scrap.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_1045"><text>Fox is at the Cordon, he got hit pretty hard too. Said as soon as he's back on his feet, he'll head here to find Red. Red himself didn't go far, he's here in some tunnel.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_10511"><text>Hm, in a tunnel? If you're heading off on your own business, maybe I should take whatever Doctor brewed to Red?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_1055"><text>Ugh... On one hand, it's good they both made it, on the other... I know what kind of wounds Fruit Punch leaves, Red doesn't have much of a chance. Buddy, help us out: we need to find Swamp Doctor, he'll definitely be able to help. He's somewhere at the Cordon, from what I've heard...</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_1061"><text>Alright, here, take the ointment.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_1062"><text>No need, I told you I'm already on my way to help him.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_1065"><text>Yeah... actually Fox asked me to do that too, but... I didn't find Doctor. Fine, I'll try looking again. I'll be back soon.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_1051"><text>Phew, I'm glad everything turned out so well, considering the situation! Well, alright. What's your name, brother? And what wind blew you here?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_1052"><text>What a goddamn mess! To hell with it all... And what do they call you, brother? What wind blew you here?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_1054"><text>I hope they got out too and will be in touch soon. Anyway, what's your name, brother? And what wind blew you here?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_106"><text>Call me Marked One. And you, if I'm not mistaken, are Mole?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_107"><text>Yeah, people call me Mole. Me and the boys used to scavenge radioactive heaps for anything worth a damn, poked around all sorts of basements. But there's nothing much of value left. Now, like most stalkers, we're in the artifact hunting business.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_108"><text>Understood. You heard anything about Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_109"><text>And why'd Strelok catch your eye? There were legends about him, his luck, rich stashes with artifacts. Many tried to get into his group, but... Word was that here, in the Agroprom underground, he's got a hideout set up, but so far no one's found it. I tried too by the way, no dice. Way too dangerous down there, high gas levels and pitch black, better not poke your head in without good gear. Ask the traders about a suit with a gas mask, or better yet, a full-face mask. Here, take a pill, boosts your vision in the dark for a bit. Might come in real handy down there.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_201"><text>Thanks for the help, stalker! In a business like this, every barrel counts. Was it you Grey sent a message about? Marked One, right?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_202"><text>Yeah, that's me. What was the beef between you and those guys?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_2051"><text>Phew, thanks, Marked One! I'm glad everything turned out so well, considering the situation...\nGrey wrote that you're interested in Strelok, right?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_2052"><text>Well, thank God! Don't even know how to thank you, Marked One. Grey wrote that you're interested in Strelok, right?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_2053"><text>Alright, if you say so. In any case — thanks a ton! Grey wrote that you're interested in Strelok, right?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_206"><text>Yeah, I've got a major memory blank, and so far he's the only lead to my past.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_207"><text>Legends were told about Strelok, his luck, rich stashes with artifacts. Many tried to join his group, but... Word was that here, in the Agroprom underground, he had a hideout set up, but no one's found it yet. I tried too by the way, but no luck.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_2071"><text>Eh, too bad. I was hoping to get, if not a direct lead, then at least some halfway decent info from you...</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_2072"><text>Well, sorry if I let you down. It's way too dangerous down there, high gas levels and pitch black, better not stick your nose in without good gear. Ask the traders about a suit with a gas mask, or better yet, a full-face mask. There's also an option to trade for a good bodysuit, "Beryll", from the local ensign. You can hash out almost any matter with that soldier, so long as you've got "fire water". Here, take another special pill, sharpens vision in the dark. Might come in real handy down there.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_208"><text>What kind of "pill" is that? Where can I get more?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_209"><text>"Cat's Eye," it's called. The eggheads over at the Swamps offer them. Not for free, of course, in exchange for all sorts of mutant guts, but hell, there's plenty of that filth around...</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_210"><text>Eggheads?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_211"><text>Haven't you heard? At the Swamps... Well, it's a place, not far from the Cordon. There's a camp of sorts there, the one that the Clear Sky folk built back in the day. Now there's a group of scientists there — researching all kinds of local monsters. They can toss a job to our stalker brother every now and then, paying mostly with different useful consumables. Anyway, they've got "Cat's Eye," and antirads, and medkits, and whatnot. You'll see for yourself when you're there.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_212"><text>So, at the Swamps, you say. And how is it there in general?</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_213"><text>In the Swamps? Well, how should I put it... Outskirts of the Zone. Almost no artifacts, but tons of small and nasty critters. There's this one old-timer there, he sews great leather coats, mostly for the local boys. I've seen some even flaunting them with gas masks... riff-raff. That old man settled somewhere in the north of the Swamps. Also, some soldiers are sitting there at an oil well, cooking up gasoline bit by bit. That's about all there is worth mentioning.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_214"><text>Understood. Alright, I'm heading out.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_301"><text>Marked One, I get that you probably want to ask something else, but first we gotta save Red. Come by later — I'll be happy to answer all your questions.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_302"><text>Hey, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_303"><text>Glad to see you, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_new_3011"><text>Got it, on my way.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="agr_krot_after_101"><text>Glad to see you, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_102"><text>Yeah, hey. So you've settled down here now, then?</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_1031"><text>Just buried my pal. He died. Didn't wait long enough for help. Now I'm thinking what to do next. I gotta get out, i'm fed up with it all!</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_1032"><text>Red's recovering bit by bit. We'll sit tight with him for a while. It's a quiet, low-key spot here. Once everything settles down, we'll probably clear out, i'm fed up with it all!</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_104"><text>Understood. Well, if you've got enough to leave with, why the hell not.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_105"><text>I reckon we've got enough to last us. Though... you can never have too much good stuff. But I've already decided, enough's enough. Just gotta wrap up a few little things so I can leave this Zone with a clear conscience. Handle a couple more jobs and that's it!</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_106"><text>Is there anywhere to go back to? Anyone waiting for you?</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_107"><text>There's no one left, really, and no need for it anyway.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_108"><text>I don't even remember if I ever had anyone waiting for me.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_109"><text>In a way, you're lucky, Marked One. Free from the past. You've only got the future.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_110"><text>Where's that future? I'm just trying to deal with the present here.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_111"><text>That's true enough.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_201"><text>Ah! Hey there, Marked One. Still keeping busy?</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_202"><text>Yeah, have to. Gotta make a living somehow. My feet keep me fed.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_203"><text>I get it. Listen, I just remembered something. Another stalker was through here lately, also asking about Strelok. Made me think of you... Seems like the past hasn't been giving folks much peace lately. Maybe it's a coincidence? Anyway, if he shows up again, I'll try to sniff out exactly what he's got on Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_204"><text>Who was he? What's his name? Maybe I can track him down myself.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_205"><text>His name? Can't recall... don't think he even introduced himself. We didn't talk long — he was in a hell of a rush.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_206"><text>Mole, think, what'd he say? He didn't come to you for no reason. Everyone in the Zone knows you're into digging.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_207"><text>He was asking about the local underground, something about a drift mine and the forest... I didn't say much. Just enough to keep the conversation going. Where'd he go? Wait, I'm such a blockhead, of course. There's an old mine working in the Red Forest. How'd I not realize that before? It's been a long time since I was in those parts, slipped my mind. Maybe that's where he headed? All sorts of rumors float around about that forest. Draws stalkers in like a magnet. Fools... The critters and anomalies there are just terrifying.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_208"><text>Not much, but thanks anyway.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_209"><text>Don't hold it against me. We'll be sticking around here for a bit, so drop by.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_after_301"><text>Hey, friend, how's it going? Well, pull up a seat.</text></string>

<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_new_0"><text>You mentioned something about an ensign you can deal with for gear. How do I find him?</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_new_1"><text>In the Agroprom SRI building, down the road to the west, a group of military has settled in. They don't mess with us, and we don't mess with them. It's a small group, maybe 30 men. Formally, some officer is in charge, but they're on watch and rotate out regularly. But the real power there is Ensign Sherstyuk. You can pull off small deals through him; he can help with gear and settle certain matters.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_new_2"><text>So what, I just walk up to the checkpoint and ask them to call Sherstyuk out?</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_new_3"><text>No, of course not. Better not stick your nose near the western complex at all. You can sometimes catch Sherstyuk on neutral ground, so to speak. He comes out to the third power line tower, over by the SRI's eastern gates. For some vodka, he'll bring you whatever you want from the armory. And maybe not just from the armory.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_new_41"><text>I see. Tell me about this place.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_new_5"><text>This whole area belongs to the Agroprom SRI. The institute building itself is to the west. And the factory — there it is, right in front of you. The building's were abandoned long ago, and there's nothing left to take. But lately, the military started searching for something pretty active-like.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_new_61"><text>Tell me more about the institute.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_new_71"><text>Legends go around about that institute. Before the accident in 1986, there was nothing here but a lonely building for the institute of cereal selection and genetics. And where the factory is now, there were experimental fields. After the accident, the institute was closed and the fields were burnt. Then they remembered it, whitewashed the building, put up a fence, and built some barracks. They put the factory where the fields used to be. Don't know what they were up to in that institute, but they clearly weren't stingy with the cash.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_new_62"><text>Tell me more about the factory.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_new_72"><text>That factory was built in the late eighties. Supposedly to build and test machines capable of working radioactive soil. But as far as I know, nobody ever saw a single machine like that. Now it's completely empty. Only stalkers like to stop there. They say it's a fairly safe spot, long as you don't go looking into the dark corners.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_new_42"><text>Thanks.</text></string>

<string id="agr_krot_dezertir_0"><text>Listen, what's with all the military movement around here anyway? I thought they only stood on the perimeter and didn't like venturing deep into the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_dezertir_1"><text>How should I know? Not far from here, in the swamp, there's a kid hiding out, looks like he went AWOL from the military base. Talk to him, he'll likely be able to clear things up.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_dezertir_2"><text>Is he there alone?</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_dezertir_3"><text>Seems so. I haven't even seen him myself, a stalker I know told me about him. Said he looks like your average rookie draftee. Always starving, poor devil, I even feel a bit sorry for him.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_dezertir_4"><text>Got it, I'll try to question him. Might as well feed the poor soul while I'm at it.</text></string>

<string id="agr_krot_pda_start_0"><text>Mole, you look like you still got something to say to me. Come on, spit it out.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_pda_start_1"><text>Well, yeah, I wanna ask you something... Not for free, of course, I'll find a way to thank you. I told you how I tried to find Strelok's stash in that underground, right? Well, I crawled into the far collector; from there, you're supposed to be able to get out onto the institute territory where the soldiers set up their base. Not a bad spot, dry, almost no rats, so I decided to poke around... And then, as luck would have it, the grunts started a raid in those same cellars. I hauled ass out of there. But in the rush, I dropped my PDA. You're heading down anyway, so maybe you'll look for it? The soldiers have surely cleared out by now.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_pda_start_21"><text>Alright. If I run into it, I'll bring it back.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_pda_start_22"><text>No, Mole, I don't have time to mess around with that kind of nonsense.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_pda_start_3"><text>Great. I'll be waiting for you in that tunnel where Red's resting up.</text></string>

<string id="agr_krot_pda_done_0"><text>I found your PDA.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_pda_done_1"><text>Is it damaged?</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_pda_done_21"><text>Seems fine, well, unless the bloodsuckers scratched it a bit, heh-heh. Here, check it.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_pda_done_22"><text>Yeah, it's crushed to hell! Nothing but shards left. Didn't bother picking them up.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_pda_done_3"><text>In one piece, even the batteries aren't dead. Hand over yours, I'll transfer a recipe for how to get a Meat Chunk artifact. Or, if you want, I can just give you an artifact, it's just the thing for improving your health.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_pda_done_41"><text>Send the recipe, I've got an interest in them.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_pda_done_42"><text>For health? Give it here, let's get patched up.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_pda_done_51"><text>I've uploaded it to your PDA. Take a couple of medkits too, they'll come in handy.</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_pda_done_52"><text>Good artifact, always useful.</text></string>
<string id="tex_agr_krot_PDA"><text>\nMole asks to find his PDA, which he left in the Agroprom underground, near the exit to the Agroprom SRI territory. He advised finding a suit with a gas mask, or better yet, a full-face mask.</text></string>
<!-- Äåçåðòèð -->
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_101"><text>Don't shoot, brother! Don't shoot!</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_102"><text>Easy now, calm down, like I really need to waste a bullet on you. What are you doing here?</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_103"><text>I'm just... sitting here, that's all.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_104"><text>What's your name then, jailbird?</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_105"><text>Kolyou... Nikolai Valuev. And yours?</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_106"><text>They know me as Marked One. What, did you desert from your unit?</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_107"><text>I left. Yeah. because I want to live. But they...\nThey sent us into the catacombs to see what's going on under the base. It's a total clusterfuck down there. So me and Sanyok made a run for it. The others, they're probably already goners. But I ain't going back to the base. They're always using us to plug every hole in this cursed Zone, those damn bastards.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_108"><text>What catacombs?</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_109"><text>Well, the underground. Right here, under us. There's a few entrances. One's right on the base territory. All sorts of critters crawl out of there sometimes. First they blocked the entrance, then they pumped gas in there, but it didn't help. So the brass got it into their heads to pull a sweep. Sent the boys in.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_1101"><text>Alright, don't get worked up. I want to ask you something.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_1102"><text>Alright, don't get worked up. Just calm down...</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_111"><text>I... Alright...</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_201"><text>Marked One, you again... Maybe you got something edible?</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_202"><text>Wait a bit, I want to ask you something.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_203"><text>I'm starving! Already having to catch rats... Fine, speak up, what'd you want?</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_204"><text>There's a rumor your boys found some important documents around here recently. You know anything about that?</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_205"><text>Uhh... Ah! You mean the ones they took off that one stalker?</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_206"><text>Maybe those, maybe others. Just tell me what you know.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_207"><text>Well, a chopper made an emergency landing not long ago. They sent a group of our guys to check out the situation. On the way, the boys ran into a couple of men. Those guys started blasting right away, so our boys dropped them. One was still breathing, even after taking a few bullets. He said they were coming from the Gut, must've been delirious, because how can you come from a gut? Ain't like they're crap, right? The other guy had a briefcase with papers. That's the whole story.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_208"><text>I think I have a guess what that "gut" is. What happened next?</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_209"><text>Nothing. They brought the briefcase and showed it to the commander. He started reading it—got all worked up—and requested an urgent radio session with HQ. As for what was in there or what happened next—hell if I know.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_210"><text>Any idea what was in those papers? Maybe some of the boys took a peek?</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_211"><text>Listen, brother, seriously, I gotta eat... Maybe you got some sausage? Or even just a crust of bread?</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_2111"><text>I've got some, here's a sausage.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_2112"><text>Got some canned food here, let me open it up.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_2113"><text>Got some bread, not too stale yet.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_2114"><text>I'm running low on grub my self. Wait here, I'll bring some soon.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_251"><text>Marked One, did you manage to scrounge up any food?</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_2511"><text>Yeah, here, have a sausage.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_2512"><text>Yep. Got some canned food, let me open it up.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_2513"><text>Got some bread, not too stale, get some strength back.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_2514"><text>Not yet. I'll drop by later.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_252"><text>Oh, much obliged! You were asking about those papers... Sanyok, a buddy of mine from back home, was in that group that went to the chopper. He told me he swiped a couple of sheets from that briefcase. Thought they were stalker notes... well, you know yourself, some guys keep logs: about safe paths, spots with lots of artifacts, or even stashes. Later, when it turned out they weren't stalker notes at all, Sanyok got spooked that the commander would go ballistic on him if he found out he'd pinched a few sheets. So he decided to hide them in his demob album and burn them later when he got the chance. And the next day they sent us into the catacombs. Sanyou grabbed his album and stashed it in a box, right by the descent into those damn cellars. Guess that album's still sitting there.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_253"><text>I see. So, in the catacombs, you say? Man, I really don't feel like crawling into that darkness.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_254"><text>Marked One, if you do decide to go down there, keep in mind it's dangerous without a gas mask. Remember I told you about the gas? Might not have cleared out yet.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_255"><text>Yeah, thanks for the warning.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_301"><text>Marked One, you again... I really need some grub.</text></string>
<string id="agr_ratcatcher_start_401"><text>Marked One, you again... I really need some grub.</text></string>

<string id="agr_01_dezertir_0"><text>Soldier, you got any clue why the military's even here?</text></string>
<string id="agr_01_dezertir_1"><text>I don't know for sure, but folks in the smoking room were saying they were testing some new machines here. Either combat ones or decont... decontam... anyway, the ones that clean up radiation.</text></string>
<string id="agr_01_dezertir_2"><text>So? They test stuff all over the place, don't they?</text></string>
<string id="agr_01_dezertir_3"><text>Yeah, but these ones were nuclear, I mean, they got nuclear engines. Only they never hauled them out. Stashed them right here in the hangar. And to make sure no one loots them, they send guards. Swap us out with choppers every two months.</text></string>

<string id="agr_02_dezertir_0"><text>So you're just sitting here guarding rusty scrap metal like warehouse watchmen? That's it?</text></string>
<string id="agr_02_dezertir_1"><text>Well, how should I put it... At first, yeah, but then something happened — a total hoot, really. We set up a bathhouse in the second hangar. And we started noticing something fishy in one of the corners. You walk in there, and it's like everything repeats. Like if someone says something, they say it again; if they drop the soap, they drop it again. And one time the sergeant major was washing up, and his steel dental crowns just flew right out.</text></string>
<string id="agr_02_dezertir_2"><text>Plenty of things can happen in a bathhouse... especially if there's booze involved.</text></string>
<string id="agr_02_dezertir_3"><text>True that, lots can happen... But that was like an anomaly. The sergeant major reported to the commander, and he goes and calls the Center. They sent a couple of scientists with some lab techs. Man... wish they'd sent some lady techs instead. Anyway, those lab boys later blabbed in the smoking room that this anomaly flipped the whole scientific world upside down. It throws a person back in time by four seconds. And here's the kicker, only if you're naked. If you're in clothes or got a weapon, no dice, it all stays here.</text></string>
<string id="agr_02_dezertir_4"><text>And what now?</text></string>
<string id="agr_02_dezertir_5"><text>Now, at the end of the summer, delegations from all over the world are supposed to show up. They're gonna test instruments, look for more anomalies like that. And to make sure there's no trouble — like, God forbid some big shot gets killed, or they shoot down a chopper with some president on board — the brass ordered to sweep the whole district clean.</text></string>
<string id="agr_02_dezertir_6"><text>Give me a break. Shoot down a chopper with a shotgun or a PM? Don't make me laugh.</text></string>
<string id="agr_02_dezertir_7"><text>I'm not talking about stalkers, we got a truce with them... Sentries said they saw some folks that weren't from around here. Clothes, gear, stalkers don't wear stuff like that. Seems like foreign intelligence got interested.</text></string>
<string id="agr_02_dezertir_8"><text>You should watch fewer spy movies.</text></string>
<string id="agr_02_dezertir_9"><text>Eh... they didn't show us no movies.</text></string>

<string id="agr_03_dezertir_0"><text>By the way, why are you living here like a hobo all by yourself? I thought you said you and your buddy bolted together.</text></string>
<string id="agr_03_dezertir_1"><text>Yeah, with Sanyok. He headed off to see Sidorovich yesterday evening, to scrounge up some food.</text></string>
<string id="agr_03_dezertir_2"><text>That's a long-ass walk to Sidorovich's place.</text></string>
<string id="agr_03_dezertir_3"><text>Nah, not really... Sanyok knows a direct path, straight from here to the Cordon.</text></string>
<string id="agr_03_dezertir_41"><text>Do you know it?</text></string>
<string id="agr_03_dezertir_42"><text>Through the Forgotten Village, you mean? Well, yeah, there is such a way... though I wouldn't call it "direct".</text></string>
<string id="agr_03_dezertir_51"><text>No, I haven't trodden that path myself. Sanyok's buddy from another platoon told him about that trail during the last shift change. He even made some marks on a map, but our lieutenant found it later and swiped it for himself. That bastard's really getting on everyone's nerves.</text></string>
<string id="agr_03_dezertir_52"><text>Yeah, that's what I'm wonderin': why Sanyok's taking so damn long to get back...</text></string>

<string id="agr_desertir_shema_dialog_0"><text>Service boy, I got a little business for you.</text></string>
<string id="agr_desertir_shema_dialog_1"><text>Business with me? I ain't bothering no one here, I'm harmless, why all of a sudden?</text></string>

<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_101"><text>What's up, stalker? Looking for me, by any chance?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_102"><text>Hm, maybe. What's your name, soldier?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_103"><text>Don't know it? I thought everyone knew me. Sherstyuk's the name, Senior Ensign's the rank. I keep order among the boys here. And who are you, handsome?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_104"><text>I'm Marked One. Sherstyuk? I heard you're the man to see for ammo.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_105"><text>Well, in principle, yeah, we can talk. But let me make one thing clear: I don't know you, and I don't know what's rattling around in your head. Let's do this: you help me out a bit first, then we'll discuss the ammo and everything else. Sound good?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_106"><text>Lay out the situation, then I'll give you an answer.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_107"><text>Hm. Yeah, you got a level head. Alright, listen. A couple of days ago, two idiots from among my wards smoked some kind of junk and decided to play Schumacher. They rolled an APC out of the bay and went tearing across the Zone. Didn't get far, obviously. It slammed into an anomaly and totaled the rig. Somehow the morons made it back alive by some miracle.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_108"><text>Right, and then what?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_109"><text>And then! Inside that APC was a black box from a crashed chopper. We were supposed to send it over to the aviation specialists. According to the leader of the group that found the crash site, the people there were turned inside out, couldn't tell what was what, just piles of bloody scraps instead of bodies. The Zone, damn her...\nAnyway, now they're waiting on that black box. Brainwashing me daily — where is it, what's the status. But the lucky survivors and the other grunts are too terrified to go near the spot where the APC crashed. You look like an experienced stalker to me, not the type to get spooked by a few dogs. Maybe you can pull that box out of there? Do that, and I'll make it worth your while. We'll be able to do plenty of business in the future.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_1101"><text>I could take a look. Where is it?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_1102"><text>Nah, I can't right now. Maybe later.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, how's it going? Ready to settle our business?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_202"><text>Where's this APC? Is it far?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_203"><text>According to the racers, it isn't that far. They headed out the east gates, drove past the small swamp, then hooked a left. They flew over a hillock and flipped into a ravine. So, it should be somewhere north of the factory with the rail substation. Not far at all. Well? You gonna head out?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_2041"><text>I'll take a look. If I can get it—I'll bring it back.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_2042"><text>Hm, no. I've got other things to deal with.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_301"><text>Marked One, how's it going with our "box"?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_3021"><text>This orange ball? Hm, why's it called a "black box" anyway?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_3022"><text>I haven't found your APC yet.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_3031"><text>Oh! Nice work, man. I owe you a bottle... Just kidding. I know you stalkers are always in need of good meds. Here, take some army rations too—very nutritious.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_304"><text>Thanks. I wanted to ask... you wouldn't happen to know anything about some documents your boys found around here recently?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_305"><text>Well, "found" is one way to put it. They took them off a couple of stalkers. Those guys ran into our search party and decided to get all rowdy for some reason, instead of sharing a bit of loot and going their separate ways like usual. So our boys dropped them. I don't know the specifics, didn't care to ask. But, I overheard that they found some scientific papers on those stalkers. Hell if I know where they dug them up. As soon as our lieutenant read those scribbles, he sent a message straight to the Special Department. I happened to be on comms duty right then. From what I gathered, they found something very important in those documents, but they're incomplete, most of it's missing. High command promised to send in some spec-ops to hunt for the rest. That's about it.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_306"><text>I see. So, what about the trade?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_307"><text>There's a bit of a hitch with the trade for now, Marked One. Someone here wants to have a word with you.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_308"><text>Who, where, and what about?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_309"><text>Now ain't the time for jokes. This is serious business, and he's a serious man, he won't take no for an answer. Our Special Department officer is waiting for you in the trailer by the road to the Institute, just over the hill. I strongly recommend you go talk to him.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_310"><text>Whoa... fine, I'll go, won't kill me. Hope they don't shoot me on sight. Last question: how often can I find you around here?</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_311"><text>I'm here at my post every single day, rain or shine. Took a bit of doing, but I managed to "persuade" the current lieutenant to keep me off the duty rosters and not sweat me about service stuff. We'll see how it goes once he gets rotated out, though.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_312"><text>Got it. Take it easy, Sherstyuk.</text></string>
<string id="sak_military_stalker_dialog_401"><text>Hey there, "Marked and Peppered," you need something?</text></string>
<string id="tex_sherstyk_job"><text>\nEnsign Sherstyuk, a military man from Agroprom who does business with stalkers, asked to bring back a "black box." It was inside an APC that his "racers" decided to take for a joyride before hitting an anomaly. It should be somewhere northeast of the factory.</text></string>

<string id="agr_manometr_sherstyk_0"><text>I'm looking for a pressure gauge, don't suppose you have one?</text></string>
<string id="agr_manometr_sherstyk_1"><text>Ha! Another one. It's like you guys planned this. Just recently some stalker was looking for a gauge; I was wondering what he needed it for. What kind of tanks is he planning to refill? But hey, if you need it, you need it. I grabbed a second one just in case, and looks like I was right to do so.</text></string>
<string id="agr_manometr_sherstyk_2"><text>What was the stalker's name?</text></string>
<string id="agr_manometr_sherstyk_3"><text>Didn't ask. Simple guy, real country type. Had a face like he crawled out of some backwater village... Anyway, where were we? You say you need a gauge? For you, just five bottles of vodka. Basically a steal.</text></string>
<string id="agr_manometr_sherstyk_4"><text>That much for some hundred-gram trinket?!</text></string>
<string id="agr_manometr_sherstyk_5"><text>Well, go on then, try finding another "trinket" like it. You taking it or what?</text></string>
<string id="agr_manometr_sherstyk_61"><text>Fine, I'll take it... Here's the vodka.</text></string>
<string id="agr_manometr_sherstyk_62"><text>Don't have that much vodka on me. Don't give it to anyone else, I'll be back.</text></string>
<string id="agr_manometr_sherstyk_71"><text>I love it when a deal's done quick. Take it.</text></string>

<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_0"><text>Ever heard about a path from here to the Cordon?</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_11"><text>The one the AWOL boys used to run for vodka and grub at Sidor's? Heard of it, course I have. Our lieutenant busted those idiots, tossed their bunks, and confiscated everything. Now I gotta resort to using middlemen. You catch my drift?</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_12"><text>You asked already. Don't know the way all the way to the Cordon, but I can show you the trail to the Forgotten Village. Bring me half a case of firewater.</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_21"><text>Can you show me that path?</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_221"><text>And where are you gonna shove those ten bottles, into your rig? Ah, not my problem. Tell me how to get to the village.</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_222"><text>Right, half a case. Just double-checking so I don't mix thing's up. There's plenty of you folks in the Zone looking for a stiff drink, can't keep track of who owes what to whom...</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_223"><text>I've been thinking, and I reckon I'll manage without your tip. Sorry for the bother.</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_3"><text>Well, I only heard about it, never trodden it myself. All I know is how to get to the nearest village. From there, the Cordon's practically a stone's throw away.</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_321"><text>What's there to tell? You got a stalker PDA? Let me mark the spot on your map. But if you want it in words: head east from here along the trail. Keep parallel to the fence the whole time. Past the fallen tree you'll see a power line; turn south there and keep walking till you hit the iron gates. Climb over to the other side, and you can't get lost from there: just follow the road, no turning back.</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_4"><text>The village? You mean the Forgotten Village? Yeah, looking at the map, it really isn't far from the Cordon. So, how do I get there?</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_5"><text>Man, you're slow on the uptake. I'm telling you, the commander basically shut down a major supply line. I need a middleman to bring some of the good stuff from Sidor. Got it now?</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_6"><text>Ah! Didn't click right away. How much?</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_7"><text>Half a case.</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_81"><text>Copy that. I'll be back once I've rounded up ten bottles of the stuff.</text></string>
<string id="sherstyk_lv_way_dlg_82"><text>You think I'm a fool? I'll find my own way there somehow.</text></string>

<string id="sherstyk_shkura_1_dialog_3"><text>Ah! Well yeah, we do. One of the boys looks after the gear, tops up the batteries when needed. How much do you need? I reckon five bottles should do for a jar. Think you can find them?</text></string>

<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_201"><text>Thank you, friend. What should I call you?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_202"><text>Don't you remember me? Sidorovich told me you were the one who saved my life...</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_203"><text>I thought your face looked familiar! You're looking good, not like a corpse at all! So, what's your name then?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_204"><text>I don't remember my real name. Just call me Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_205"><text>Well, Marked One, thanks again. How'd you find me?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_2061"><text>I ran into Fox at the Cordon; he was in a bad way too. Asked me to find you and help out.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_2062"><text>I Was laying low from some suspicious types. Ended up wandering in here by accident...</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_207"><text>Well, I owe you. I don't have anything on me right now, but later on, I hope I'll find a way to pay you back. You probably know by now that I stumbled into an anomaly; I had to ditch my pack with all my loot. Some clever soul probably snatched up my things by now... Anyway, I'll be resting here for a while, and then maybe we'll see each other again—we could go hunting for artifacts together.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_2071"><text>Don't worry about it. You helped me, I helped you. Let's call it even.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_2072"><text>By the way, want to hear something funny? I had a special anomaly detector on me that's designed to recognize that nasty invisible Fruit Punch I stepped into. Swapped it from Screw a while back. And wouldn't you know it, I tucked it into my pack literally two minutes before we got ambushed. A pack of dogs was lounging nearby, and I didn't want to stir them up with a stray beep. Why am I telling you this? If you're interested, try looking for my backpack. The detector was in a hidden compartment, so even if someone already rummaged through the pack, they might have missed it. If you find it, keep it, it didn't do me much good anyway. I dropped the pack near the transformer booth by the train cars.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_208"><text>Well, I'll try to find your gadget. I'm sick to death of those Fruit Punch puddles myself.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_251"><text>Hey. Have we met before or not? What's your name?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_252"><text>Don't you remember me? Sidorovich told me that some guy named Red pulled me out of a wrecked truck. I'm the Marked One. That's what you can call me.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_253"><text>Well, Marked One, I guess we're acquainted then. What brings you here?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_2541"><text>I ran into Fox at the Cordon; he was in a bad way too. He asked me to find you and help out.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_2542"><text>I was laying low from some suspicious types. Ended up wandering in here by accident...</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_255"><text>Hm, I got hit pretty hard here. But I've rested up for the most part. I won't be running marathons anytime soon, obviously, but I'm not planning on kicking the bucket either. You looking good too, hardly look like a corpse at all... Just kidding. Anyway, if you aren't in a rush, let's take a breather.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_256"><text>Sure, why not...</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_hello_dialog_301"><text>Greetings, Marked One. Are you here on business or just passing through?</text></string>

<string id="rygyi_01_dialog_0"><text>Hold on, I'll help. Doc sent some medicine over...</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_01_dialog_1"><text>O-o-oh!...</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_01_dialog_21"><text>Alright, I need to soak two bandages with this ointment...</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_01_dialog_22"><text>Damn it to hell... I don't have any bandages! Hang in there just a bit longer, I'll find some and be right back.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_01_dialog_3"><text>Argh! Just shoot me instead!..</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_01_dialog_4"><text>Now to wrap it... grit your teeth, brother. Almost done...</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_01_dialog_5"><text>Phew! It's easing up... think I'm gonna live after all...</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_01_dialog_6"><text>Good to hear...</text></string>

<string id="rygyi_02_dialog_0"><text>How can I help you?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_02_dialog_1"><text>Find Doctor from the swamps... only he can help...</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_02_dialog_2"><text>Alright, I'll find him. Hang in there.</text></string>

<string id="rygyi_03_dialog_0"><text>I've got some ointment left over. Doctor mixed it specifically for you.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_03_dialog_1"><text>Ointment? Well, I don't think it'll hurt to have extra. You sure you don't mind?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_03_dialog_2"><text>Hm... No, take it.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_03_dialog_3"><text>Okay, thanks. I'll use it. My legs are still killing me...</text></string>

<string id="rygyi_cars_dialog_0"><text>I wanted to ask, how did you find me exactly? Did you really pull me out of that truck?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_cars_dialog_1"><text>Nah... nobody's ever been found alive in those trucks. And that particular truck skidded all the way to the Cordon—it's unheard of for them to make it that far south. Curiosity got the better of me. Usually, stalkers steer clear of 'em; they reeks too much of death... But I rummaged around and spotted you nearby. You were lying just a short distance away.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_cars_dialog_2"><text>So? That means I wasn't actually inside the truck then.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_cars_dialog_3"><text>How should I know? The damn thing flipped over! I don't know how you ended up there. Maybe you were inside and fell out, or maybe it’s not connected at all. But it’s a strange coincidence... Of course I hauled you out, wasn't gonna just leave you there. Sidorovich just decided for some reason that you definitely came from that truck.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_cars_dialog_4"><text>What can you tell me about those trucks? Why do they say they're full of corpses?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_cars_dialog_5"><text>I can't say for sure. Plenty of rumors, but the weirdest part is that they appear out of nowhere... like they're coming out of holes in space itself.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_cars_dialog_6"><text>Say what?!</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_cars_dialog_7"><text>My jaw dropped just like yours when I first heard it. Ask around—people will tell you even wilder stories than that... Ah, forget it. Maybe you really weren't on that truck. You're alive, and that's what matters.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_cars_dialog_8"><text>Easy for you to say "forget it"... I'm the one who needs to remember.</text></string>

<string id="rygyi_tesla_dialog_0"><text>Ever been to the Tesla Zone?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_tesla_dialog_1"><text>Never had the chance. Me and the boys were gonna head there once, but it didn't pan out. Ever know Curly Vitya? Well, doesn't matter... he was a real veteran stalker. He met this guy called Guide and managed to pry the path out of him. Said he’d go alone first to check things out, and then we’d all head there together. \nHe went and brought back two capsules with "Souls" inside, completely covered in green, can you imagine? We were itching to go too! But Curly started acting weird. "I've got a bad feeling about this," he says. "If you guys want it that bad, I'll draw you a map and you can go for it, but I'm staying put. My soul feels heavy," he says. And that same day, some crazy idiot shot Vitya. He was gonna clean his rifle, took the magazine out, but didn't clear the chamber—he fired off a shot and hit Curly right in the chest... \nSo he never did draw us that map. Maybe it was for the best...</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_tesla_dialog_2"><text>Maybe so...</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_tesla_dialog_3"><text>Maybe... or maybe not. Too many coincidences involving that Guide...\nAnyway, listen to me rattling on like an old lady at the market.</text></string>

<string id="rygyi_black_tip_0"><text>Pal, you ever hear of a curse called the Black Mark?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_black_tip_1"><text>Who hasn't? It's right up there with the Black Stalker, the Wish Granter, and all the other tall tales. Why the sudden interest?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_black_tip_2"><text>Doesn't... matter. I need to find out how to get rid of it. You wouldn't happen to know, would you?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_black_tip_3"><text>Nope. You know Raven? The guy who collects rare trinkets for collectors. He's been hanging around the farm in the Dark Valley lately. I remember someone telling me that Raven has plenty of info on that parasite, but he asks such a high price for it that a stalker would sooner die of a heart attack from the cost than from the "Black Mark" itself.</text></string>

<string id="rygyi_red_spring_dummy_0"><text>Listen, have you ever heard of the Ruby Spring?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_red_spring_dummy_1"><text>Hm, not only heard of it, but seen it too... In principle, they're pretty easy to get, those Rubies... You just need the base artifact, a regular Spring.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_red_spring_dummy_2"><text>I was told they can clear away anomalies?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_red_spring_dummy_3"><text>Don't know about that, but a Ruby is worth a lot more; traders will shell out a mountain of cash for one. But it weighs a ton. By the time you haul it back, you'll be sweating buckets... Why do you ask?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_red_spring_dummy_4"><text>I need to help a fellow stalker, an anomaly blocked his only way out. So I wanted to give it a shot.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_red_spring_dummy_5"><text>A good deed... Well, basically, you need to toss a Spring into a Snow anomaly. That's how it transforms into a Ruby one. So, go try and find yourself a Spring.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_red_spring_dummy_6"><text>Thanks, I'll look for one...</text></string>
