<string id="prizrak_attention"><text>Finally managed to find a way to get here. Hope it won't be hard for you to follow my path using the marks I left.\nSo, apparently this is an auxiliary control post, but I found plans, diagrams and operating manual for the Brain Scorcher power system here. Everything just as you said. Couldn't figure it out right away, so I'll take it to show to a specialist. You don't know him, but he's a reliable guy. Hope you won't mind this little initiative of mine?\nAnd... Sorry about that incident, but I still think you were wrong to insist on saving that strange guy in the Thicket. Who knows what he could have understood or seen!\nP.S. About the "Black Mark" - I didn't quite understand you at our last meeting. Are you looking for the "Mark" itself or do you need a "carrier"?\nP.P.S. While digging through papers here, I also learned that behind the door by the opposite wall is the entrance to an evacuation tunnel. Through it you can get to the surface somewhere in Dark Valley, but definitely not in the bandits' lair. I'll use it.\nGhost - to Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="mar_attention"><text>Guys! \nThere's a stalker in the mine shaft. I caught an SOS signal from his PDA when I was nearby. Seems like he's been without water for a long time and can't speak - only wheezing and hissing comes from the depths of the tunnel. The "Whirligig" at the entrance is very powerful, won't be able to slip through even with good gear and artifacts. I talked to one Duty guy, he gave me an idea. Supposedly such an anomaly can be collapsed with a "Ruby Spring" artifact. I don't have one, but in the village at Cordon they were saying they saw one at Agroprom. I'll run there. Hope it's not too late. If you're reading this, have a "Ruby Spring" with you or know another way to get inside, HELP the guy! \nVadya Gvozd</text></string>
<string id="esc_attention"><text>Addressing everyone!\n1) We are in the Zone, full of all kinds of mutated creatures, so let's not create additional problems. If you need to relieve yourself, take a shovel from the duty officer, go away (at least to the ravine behind the hill) and bury it after yourself... Mutants come running to the smell! I'm sick of losing good guys because of idiots!\n2) Stop acting like Rambos and picking fights with the military! The troublemaker might run away, but then everyone else has to deal with the consequences... If I see this - I'll personally shoot you! Then complain to whoever you want...\n3) Sidorovich may be a greedy bastard, but without him it would be much harder for us to survive, so be more respectful...\n4) At the northern exit from the village, there has long been an invisible anomaly, so here's advice: go around the tree on the left when exiting or on the right when entering.\n5) When leaving - turn off the lights! Generator fuel doesn't fall from the sky.\n6) Kuznetsov warned that their group is in Dark Valley, better not go there.\nWolf.</text></string>
<string id="sid_attention"><text>I'm telling everyone!\n1) Please: stop dragging all kinds of stinking mutant garbage! The whole warehouse already reeks! If needed - I'll tell you myself what exactly is needed!\n2) If you see some moron trying to act like a great merchant, let me know, I'll deal with it (otherwise he'll sell you some crap - you'll never wash it off).\n3) Near the tunnel that leads to the Gut, a group of hunters has settled recently (that's what they call themselves). I think it's better not to get involved, something tells me those guys are in cahoots with Borov.\nTrader Sidorovich.</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention"><text>Stalkers!\n</text></string>
<string id="doktor_attention"><text>Hello, Marked One! I hope you didn't step on the tripwire that Fang set at the entrance on your advice.\nIf you don't know yet, you can get out of this shelter quickly and safely. Here by the door, if you activate the "Compass" artifact on your belt, a teleport activates that takes you to Foggy Thicket, to a safe cave.\nThe artifact discharges in the process, but the charge in that specimen I left for Fang should definitely be enough for one more transfer. If you're interested, I'll explain later when we meet how to recharge such artifacts, restoring their lost properties.\n \nAnd now the main thing. I found out where Ghost is now...\nYou must definitely meet. Unfortunately, at the moment I can't personally bring you together, as I have problems and need to lay low for a while.\nLet's agree, as soon as everything settles down, I'll send you a message, and we'll meet in the old hut in Foggy Thicket.\nP.S. How is Fang holding up? I'm sure there must be a way to help him.\nDoctor.</text></string>

Event program: \n
1. Opening. \n
2. Presentation: "Psychotherapy of schizophrenia" by Dr. of Medical Sciences, Prof. Surikov A.K. \n
3. Report: "Analysis of mental states of people who have been in the exclusion zone" by Candidate of Medical Sciences Latsis I.A. \n
4. Discussion, debates. \n
6. Miscellaneous. \n
... \n
I.A. Latsis. \n
Dear colleagues, I am grateful for the previous report. In turn, I would like to once again draw attention to the problem of patients from the so-called exclusion zone, commonly referred to as the Zone. \n
(noise in the hall) \n
As you already know, recently cases of F20 diagnosis with various manifestations have become more frequent. A thorough analysis of this problem was conducted... \n
... \n
If we look at the graph, we observe a rapid growth in the number of patients. This is clearly visible in this part - summer-autumn of the year before last, here - from summer to winter of last year, and starting from early spring of this year. And as you can see, the number of patients in each outbreak period steadily grows. That is, there is an obvious trend, and we should expect another even larger outbreak in the near future. Moreover, the frequency of disease manifestations is more similar to outbreaks characteristic of such seasonal viral infections as, for example, FLU, which is very strange, considering the given specificity of the disease. Detailed analysis showed that 95% of all patients with the indicated diagnosis, identified during this outbreak period, are somehow connected to the Zone itself. Many of them stayed there briefly or for long periods, some were not there personally but are relatives of those who visited, some are connected to them by other relationships. But the connection to the so-called Zone is obvious. \n
Therefore, we need to prepare for a possible problem now and conduct a comprehensive study to identify the cause of this. \n
... \n
(noise in the hall) \n
Let me still finish... \n
I suggest you follow the patients' statements in this video during viewing, pay attention to the subtitles, they will comment on the ongoing psychotherapeutic processes. Try to compare what the patients say. I won't intrigue you - all these are things of the same order, everyone essentially talks about the same thing, the difference is only in the psychological impact on patients. \n \n

Video (51:42 ñ 1:24:30 according to the recording) \n
Video discussion. \n \n

Question from the hall: It's not entirely clear what fragments all the patients were talking about? Are these physical objects or still their hallucinatory delirium? \n
I.A. - Colleague, it seemed to me everything was obvious. We perfectly understand that all these patients have F20 diagnosis. The essence of the video demonstration was to show the general trend, to outline the basis of the problem. All patients say practically the same thing in different forms. But they are not connected to each other in any way, the only thing that connects them is being in the Zone. And yet they all have such similar obsessive delirious thoughts. We need to think about what leads such different people, completely independent of each other, who visited the Zone at different times, to practically identical visions... \n \n

Question from the hall: As far as I know from some sources, in this very Zone there exists a legend about a certain Monolith. As we understood, we're talking about fragments of this very Monolith. The legend about it is passed from mouth to mouth, and this is actually what unites all cases. Isn't that so? \n
I.A. - Colleague, you are right, of course. But our task is not to analyze rumors and myths, but to understand the reason why these rumors and myths become the basis of hallucinations and delirium. This is quite strange, you must agree. We need to identify the mechanism of this manifestation. After all, not all returnees have such ideas, and not all patients immediately start raving about this specifically. However, over time, everyone somehow comes to the same thing. What is the trigger? We must find out to prevent further outbreaks and epidemic. \n \n

Remark from the hall: What epidemic are we talking about?! In my opinion, several identical hallucinations are not an indicator and not grounds to speak of some "epidemic". We can only state a new type of hallucination. But this is understandable. First they rave about God and the devil, then with the development of technology, patients already rave about aliens and terminators from the future... \n
I.A. - You, dear colleague, completely didn't understand that the video shows only a few cases. But there are much, much more of them and this number is continuously growing. Wasn't this clear from the first part of my report! We are facing a huge problem. Yes, the concept of "epidemic" in this case is conditional. But the mechanism is identical. You already see the growth, see the obvious trend. Moreover, people who have not been to the Zone, but are somehow connected to those who were there, are also susceptible to this. And what will happen in a year, in five years?!.. \n \n

Remark from the hall: Mr. Latsis, let's not become like your patients. This is not the first time you try to convey to the public your... forgive me for God's sake, not delusional, but, you must agree, contrived idea of yours. Look not at relative, but at absolute indicators. The number of cases in each of your outbreaks is not as frightening as you are trying to present to us here. And if you choose a different scale for the graph, the outbreaks will seem even steeper, won't they? This whole "problem" is not a problem at all... \n
... \n
(1:38:15 - 1:47:10 - noise in the hall, exclamations, shouts, conversations among themselves. I.A. Latsis leaves the hall.) \n
... \n
A.K. Surikov: Colleagues, let's finally calm down... Are there any more specific questions about the video?.. Then we'll postpone the discussion and debates, since the speaker has left us. Let's move on to the concluding part of the meeting. \n
...</text></string>

Incoming: \n
What happened again? \n
Outgoing: \n
They understood nothing. For the umpteenth time. I'm tired of all this fuss, I'm going to the Zone. It's useless to prove anything here anymore. \n
Incoming: \n
Why specifically to the Zone, what's the point? \n
Outgoing: \n
I'll find them this fragment, whatever it is, and show it. Then even the last skeptics will understand. \n
Incoming: \n
And aren't you afraid that... \n
Outgoing: \n
Come on! I'm still sufficiently informed and understand the scale of the problem. \n
Incoming: \n
I hope so... And what were you saying about zombies? Do you see some connection in this? \n
Outgoing: \n
You don't understand either... Don't you see that all patients degrade one way or another? I believe that they will all eventually become what we call zombies. This, by the way, is another reason for my departure to the Zone. There these zombies are in their natural environment, so to speak. We need to understand what leads to such a state. And perhaps, if I can bring some of them back to normal appearance, we'll understand the cause of all this madness faster... \n
Incoming: \n
Somehow all this is far-fetched. Hard to believe... \n
Outgoing: \n
In any case, you won't know unless you try. \n
Incoming: \n
Well, God willing...</text></string>

<!-- [2] Excerpts from medical histories  -->
<!-- Patient A -->
<string id="strelok_flash_news_2"><text>Gender: male. \n
Age: 45 years. \n
Referral diagnosis according to ICD: Paranoid schizophrenia F20.0 \n
...  \n
History of present disorder. \n
The patient's condition changed 1 month before hospitalization: he became irritable, began to fear everyone, suspect those around him. Began to consider himself exceptional, marked by some god... \n
Upon admission to the regional clinical psychiatric hospital, he expressed individual ideas about his condition, could not explain the reason for his hospitalization, stated that he agreed to stay in the hospital for several days, was interested in the terms of hospitalization, as he wanted to continue his work activity (as a janitor). Attention is extremely unstable, speech pressure, speech accelerated in pace... \n
The patient imagines himself as one of the chosen ones who can wield the super-weapon of some god-Monolith. This gift, according to the patient, he received in the Zone as a mercy of the Monolith. He needs the super-weapon to carry out retribution against those who oppose the god-Monolith and those who do not wish to bear his sign - a certain fragment - part of the Monolith's body... \n
... \n
Qualification of mental status. \n
The patient's mental status is dominated by specific thinking disorders: derailment, paralogic thinking, actualization of secondary signs, circumstantiality, attention disorders (pathological distractibility). Criticism of his condition is reduced. Makes unrealistic plans for the future - to return for the super-weapon to the Zone, to the place where he hid it... \n
... \n
Final diagnosis: Paranoid schizophrenia, episodic type of course, with increasing personality defect. ICD-10 code F20.024</text></string> 

<!-- Patient B -->
<string id="strelok_flash_news_3"><text>Gender: male. \n
Age: 34 years. \n
Referral diagnosis according to ICD: Schizophrenia F20.0 \n
... \n
Disease history (according to the patient): \n
Considers himself ill for about a year, when he was laid off due to troubles at work. Since then, memory disorders began, he started forgetting much from life. Twice he woke up with complete incomprehension of who he is, what he's doing here, how he ended up in his apartment. Later he stopped distinguishing his true memories from what seems to him or what he invented himself. Against this background, memories appeared, as he believes, of completely different people and other lives. The patient realizes and confirms that at least six more personalities live in his body, with whom he cannot establish contact... \n
Hears voices. These voices do not belong to familiar people. The patient considers them voices of other personalities living in his body. The patient often speaks anxiously about one of the voices - particularly clearly heard by him, which constantly calls to itself or to some Monolith, which makes him rush about searching for a path to the one who calls... \n
... \n
Clinical diagnosis: Schizophrenia. \n
Milligan syndrome - "multiple personality". \n
Continuously progressive type of course. \n
... \n
Inpatient treatment prescribed at the Regional Clinical Psychiatric Hospital. \n
(Note. About three months ago the patient disappeared from the clinic. His current whereabouts are unknown.)</text></string>

<!-- Patient C -->
<string id="strelok_flash_news_4"><text>Gender: male. \n
Age: 38 years. \n
Referral diagnosis according to ICD: Schizophrenia F20.0 \n
... \n
Justification of clinical diagnosis. \n
Patient complaints of frequently heard voices near the head, voices are threatening, commenting and approving in nature. Frightening voices cause feelings of fear, stupor, involuntary spasming of neck and facial muscles, rolling of eyes. The patient is convinced that voices can affect his somatic condition. These complaints are characteristic of true hallucinatory perception disorders. \n
From the disease history data it follows that the disease debut manifested against the background of a psychotraumatic situation, which is characteristic of the dynamics of schizophrenia development. \n
The results of mental status examination reveal thinking pace disorder in the form of its slowing, thinking content disorder in the form of delusional ideas of persecution and influence. In combination with existing perception disorders, a picture of paranoid syndrome is formed. The patient strives to protect the world from the influence of some Monolith and its servants. Believes that only he can contain the growth of the Monolith's influence, not let it spread its seed - in the form of fragments. At the same time, he sees in all surrounding people servants of the Monolith - monolithians, which characterizes the paranoid form of the disease. \n
... \n
Types of observation and treatment plan: \n
- The patient is indicated for inpatient treatment during periods of condition exacerbations. \n
- Treatment regimen: long-term continuous pharmacological treatment is necessary to consolidate the effect and prevent exacerbations.</text></string>

<!-- Patient D -->
<string id="strelok_flash_news_5"><text>Full years: 31 \n
Place of work: unemployed \n
Clinical diagnosis: Schizophrenia, paranoid form \n
Continuously progressive course \n
Hallucinatory-paranoid syndrome \n
... \n 
Reason for hospitalization. \n
The patient was admitted to City Psychiatric Hospital No. 6 by ambulance. He was found on the street naked in an insane state. He was in catatonic stupor for about three weeks. Then the acute attack passed, the patient began to speak first incoherently, then more or less coherently. "Voices" appeared, he began to talk without an interlocutor. After some clarification of consciousness, the patient reported that it is now 2018 for him. He asked to be protected from the influence of some Monolith. According to him, this influence has already spread to a much larger territory than the so-called Zone in the present time, in which he, according to him, was 6 years ago. The patient constantly strives to do something to stop the growth of the Zone and not allow the Monolith to split into millions of parts... \n
... \n
Recommendations. \n
The patient needs continuous long-term treatment with selected drugs in adequate dosages. The patient is recommended to stay in hospital conditions due to the fact that his social connections are disrupted, the patient has no own place of residence. The patient is indicated for creative self-expression therapy according to M.E. Burno, occupational therapy, as he is very active, energetic, wants to work. Recommended work activity - any, except intellectual.</text></string>

<!-- Patient #7 -->
<string id="strelok_flash_news_6"><text>
- What torments you? \n
- Voices torment me. \n
- What kind of voices are these? \n
- I don't know where they speak, above or in the hair roots. \n
- What do they say? \n
- They say: you must carry me, you must talk to me. \n
- Who are they? \n
- I don't know. I tell you, it grows in my head, under the hair. \n
- Voices grow under the hair? \n
- No, a sprout. \n
- A sprout of what? \n
- A sprout of the Monolith. It grows in me. And then I will have to give birth to it. \n
- How to give birth? Do men give birth? \n
- So what, I'll give birth from my head, how don't you understand... \n
- Now tell me: is this your illness or do the voices really speak? \n
- I don't know, what do you think? \n
- What do you think? \n
- I think I have an illness. I lie in the hospital to give birth to it... \n
- So these voices don't exist, this is a manifestation of illness? \n
- I don't know. Maybe not, but the sprout exists... It appeared there - in the Sanatorium. \n
- What Sanatorium? \n
- Well, the Sanatorium in the Zone. I wanted to get treatment there, collected medicines, collected a lot. And it says: leave everything, take me, I'll be useful to you, I'm better than medicines... I took it. \n
- And where did you leave the medicines? \n
- There. In the Sanatorium. A lot... \n
- Well, good. And do you have visions? What does this sprout look like? \n
- I don't have visions, and it only says: "Carry me and I will make you immortal". Do you see this sprout, right here, look, under the hair? \n
- No, I don't see... Now tell me - what is this? \n
- Illness. \n
- I also say it's an illness... You need to continue treatment. \n
- I'm getting treatment. If possible, I ask everyone, don't remove it, I need it. It took my medicines away, how will I get treatment now without it... \n \n
By brightness, intensity, severity of these hallucinations they belong to true ones, but they already have features distinguishing them from true ones. They have not yet completely acquired the character of pseudohallucinations, but some prerequisites for this exist. First, the patient does not identify them with the real world, he says - "maybe this is a manifestation of disease". Then these hallucinations begin to sound not only from real space, but from the body, from hair. Their content, along with the imperative, begins to acquire the character of influence - "the sprout must be born, I must give birth to it". It is not excluded that the patient's true hallucinations begin to show a tendency to transition into pseudohallucinations, but this transition is still not expressed clearly enough, not clearly enough; however, the tendency to this is already detected.</text></string>

<string id="strelok_flash_news_7"><text>
- What's happening to you? \n
- I can't understand myself. \n
- Namely? \n
- I never thought I wouldn't want to live, but now I don't want to live. \n
- It seems you've developed a conviction that you'll never die? \n
- Yes. \n
- Why are you immortal? \n
- When they gave me insulin... Everyone gets insulin and I asked them all how they felt. But imagine, I had shock, and when I opened my eyes, I looked - shock or not, I felt it. \n
- What follows from this? \n
- Nothing follows. Until half the shocks I didn't have this phenomenon that I don't want to live, but when half the shocks were done, I immediately had something right here, in my head... and here... everything, well everything happened, - I can't even explain it in words. \n
- What happened to you? \n
- Something twisted... I felt that now he knows everything. \n
- Who is he? \n
- A little stone, a fragment. I tried not to show myself to him, didn't want to show him our world, he's so vulnerable. But after insulin I decided to show him. \n
- An unpleasant sensation? \n
- Yes. I used to want to live, did everything from the heart. Even if I get tired, I do it from the heart and what I do, I'm satisfied with this work of mine. \n
- And now? \n
- Now my heart has turned to stone, there's absolutely no soul, none of it at all. He took all my soul, this little stone in me, took it, but made me immortal when I showed him everything. \n
- When did you get thoughts about immortality? \n
- Right away, when he appeared here... When I found him there, in Foggy Thicket, he told me: "Leave everything and come with me. Take me. With me you will gain eternal life". I thought then that now I won't die. \n
- Never? \n
- Yes. Only I used to feel strength in my hands, but now there's some powerlessness, as if the sinews were pulled from my hands. He immobilized me. \n
- You're in a state of powerlessness and will live forever? \n
- Yes. \n
- Will you suffer forever? From the feeling of heaviness, powerlessness? \n
- It's not that it's heaviness, I don't even know how to convey it. It's temporary. Against the backdrop of eternity, all this is temporary. \n
- How does time go for you - fast or slow? \n
- I'll tell you now, from one meal to another it seems very fast to me, the stomach can't cope, but then time goes very, very slowly when he takes over and puts me in this state. And sometimes the opposite, fast. Like there in that Foggy Thicket. There too everything was so fast. I left him there by the quarry everything I had, all my artifacts. Took him with me and immediately everything became slow... \n
- What is your sleep like? How do you sleep? \n
- I haven't had my own sleep even once now. All dreams are his. I sleep, eyes closed, I sleep, and will sleep, - they gave aminazine, pills, I'll sleep, but in the morning I don't feel that I slept my own sleep, that my body and head rested. He dictated sleep to me. The same one every time. \n \n

This patient exhibits, though rather meager, delusions of grandeur, immortality, Cotard's delusion. The patient claims he will never die, will live forever, will always suffer from his powerlessness, feeling of heaviness. Cotard's delusion, fantastic delusion, also belongs to sensory delusion. It arises during a depressive state. The patient believes that depression is induced by some little stone inside him, which controls his mood and his dreams. The little stone is a Monolith fragment, which he heard about before in the Zone, mentally "talks" with it and imposes emotional state. The patient's depression manifests as a feeling of powerlessness, oppressive heaviness, lack of appetite, lack of food taste and change in the flow of time. Time during depression flows slowly, this is one of the characteristic symptoms.</text></string>

- Please tell me, what torments you? \n
- Obsessions torment me, that's what they told me. I hide everything... \n
- How does this manifest? \n
- I hide everything I find... Many times over. \n
- Why? \n
- It's necessary... If I don't do it, he'll get offended... \n
- What will happen? \n
- Something bad. \n
- What bad thing could happen? \n
- He'll stop talking to me. \n
- Who is he? \n
- A Monolith fragment. I searched for him and found him. \n
- Why did you search? \n
- He asked: come to me, find me. I went, but it was really bad there, and he wouldn't come to me. I had to bring a lot of things in exchange for him to accept me. \n
- And what did you bring in exchange? \n
- Weapons, all kinds of clothes. I brought them there, to the "Scorcher" and left them, and he said: good, now I'm yours, just hide me. And now he gets offended if I don't hide him well enough... \n
- What is this "Scorcher"? \n
- It's such a place, you can't go there, but I went because he asked me to find him, but I didn't go far, it burns the brain there, am I stupid or what? I put everything by the trailer nearby. \n
- And where did he ask you to hide him? \n 
- Here. \n
- In your ear? \n
- No. In my head. He said this is the right place. I hid him and left. \n
- Where did you go? \n
- I don't remember. I left the Zone. Because he needed it that way. You can't offend him. He has little people who guard him. I see them on the floor... \n
- How do you see them, in your head or on the floor? What kind of little people? \n
- Such small ones... \n
- What color? \n
- I saw them vaguely... Normal color. They're Monolithians... I'm afraid of them. \n
- Why? \n
- Because they're bad. \n
- How do you know they're bad? \n
- They keep telling me to hide the fragment, not show it to anyone and not tell anyone about the road. \n
- What road? \n
- I don't know... Underground road. \n
- Do they talk to you? \n
- No, they don't talk. But they forbid me to walk there. They just repeat - two, three, five, seven... and something else. \n
- What are these numbers? \n
- That's how many times you can't walk there. \n
- And where does the underground road lead? Where can't you walk? \n
- There. To him. \n
- Who is he? \n
- He is everything. He is the one who gave the fragment. You can't disobey him. \n
- Why does he have such power over you? Who is he? \n
- A stone. \n
- And why does he know your thoughts? And influence you? \n
- I don't know... \n
- So stones also influence you? \n
- Yes, also. \n
- And how does he influence you, through what? \n
- Through hypnosis, probably... \n
- Does he read your thoughts? \n
- Yes. \n
- Does he affect your mood? \n
- Yes, I talk to him. \n
- Mentally? \n
- No, I whisper. \n
- And he hears? \n
- He hears. \n
- And do you see him? \n
- Now I see him mentally, like in fog... \n
- Does he want to do evil or good? \n
- Evil. \n
- And how do you interfere with him? \n
- I don't want to hide him, and he gets angry... \n
- And what's in your hand now? \n
- A piece of paper. He asked me not to show it... \n 
- Here are the same numbers. And what are these dashes? \n 
- These are basements. You can't walk there to him. He doesn't like it when I show... \n \n 
 
In this case the obsession manifests in that the patient must constantly hide something, hide everything he takes in his hands or finds. Along with this, the patient exhibits other disorders - the patient cannot concentrate, switches from one topic to another. He also sees "little people" on the floor. The "little people" are apparently not a hallucinatory phenomenon, but pseudohallucinatory. Pseudohallucinations differ from true hallucinations in the following way: from true ones you can turn away, from pseudohallucinations you cannot. The description of "little people" corresponds not to true hallucinations, but to vivid representations of imagination. And also, some stone was discovered that influences him, and basements where you can't walk a certain number of times. In addition, the patient fears that he will be punished and at the same time strives to show what he is "asked" to carefully hide. These drawings and numbers he demonstratively draws on walls, on the floor, on the table, on scraps of paper and each time again tries to hide. That is, there is a conflict of interests between the external personality and the internal one.</text></string>

<string id="bar_attention1"><text>Stalkers. \n \nWe've designated a special place for you to hang decent notices, hang them here. Otherwise you've stuck them all over the corners: one is looking for "friends" with common interests, another needs a magazine... You've dirtied all the walls! This isn't a brothel for you, but a decent bar. \nAnd don't forget to take them down yourselves if the information is outdated. \nBarkeep</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention2"><text>Stalker! \n \nI'm addressing you specifically! \nIf you care about the future of humanity, if you feel your responsibility for this world, if you want to make it better and cleaner - come anytime and enlist in "Duty"! \nColonel Petrenko</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention3"><text>Stalkers. \n \nI asked you to hang notices HERE! What's not clear? If I see someone's notice on the wall again - I'll nail it to his forehead. \nBarkeep</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention4"><text>Stalkers and Duty members. \n \nI think I clearly explain to every newcomer: there are special latrines for natural needs. Is it really hard to go there? No discipline whatsoever! They've made a mess, you understand... Already can't walk through the barracks without a flashlight even during the day. \nSergeant Kitsenko</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention5"><text>Stalker! \n \nI'm addressing you specifically! \nIf you don't want the whole world to become one big Zone, if you feel your connection to all humanity, if you want to do something to eradicate such a contagion as the Zone, but don't know what yet, - come anytime and enlist in "Duty"! \nColonel Petrenko</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention6"><text>Attention everyone. \n \nRegarding the recent shooting incident. \nIf some freak starts firing from all barrels "at crows" again, especially at night, he'll be kicked out of the Bar forever. (This also applies to "Duty" fighters, but the conversation with them will be different.) \nColonel Ivantsov</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention7"><text>Stalkers. \n \nIf anyone needs something repaired or fixed, come in, don't be shy, there've been few orders lately. Really, nothing breaks? Tell others too - we're always here. \nDocent</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention8"><text>In the Zone nowadays there's little guts, \nBut Prosha will help out - he's our guy. \nGo to Agro - you'll get grub, \nGo to Sidorovich - you'll get a receipt. \n \nUnknown</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention9"><text>Notice \n \nWho left an AK-74 for repair three days ago? Everything's been ready for a long time, come and pick it up. And someone brought a PM a week ago, it's still lying around. I'm not a warehouse or storage facility, take your junk immediately. \nYurko Lisaped</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention10"><text>Stalkers. \n \nA storage facility has been specially opened for you. Approach General Voronin, pay and use your cell to your heart's content. Otherwise lately there have been complaints about theft. That's what the storage is for, and if you're stingy with money, then don't complain. \nWarrant Officer Plichko</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention11"><text>Stalkers. \n \nIf someone feels that he's done much in his life that he now regrets, that he's ashamed to remember and doesn't know who he can speak to and how to get forgiveness, come, I'm ready to listen and tell you about Him who has compassion for everyone and who is ready to forgive anyone if he turns to Him. \nFather Diodor</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention12"><text>Guys. \n \nI have excellent stuff - any stalker's dream. Come in, let's discuss. If you don't know where to find me, ask around - they'll tell you. \nSultan</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention13"><text>Stalkers. \n \nThere's an opportunity to earn good money. Jobs both simple and more complex - just choose. Fast and adequate payment and no one will ask you to trek to the Monolith - everything is quite doable. So don't be afraid, approach. \nContact the Barkeep.</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention14"><text>Stalker! \n \nI'm addressing you specifically! \nIf you consider yourself a real man, if you feel the strength and desire to deal with this Zone contagion and make the world cleaner, if you don't want your family and loved ones to live in a world resembling the Zone, - come anytime and enlist in "Duty"! \nColonel Petrenko</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention15"><text>If you suddenly got lucky with artifacts, \nDon't think it's just good fortune! \nSanyok will trade everything pretty well, \nBut he'll scam you on artifacts like a sucker! \n \nUnknown</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention16"><text>Stalkers! \n \nYou are on "Duty" territory, you've been sheltered here and given the opportunity to rest and eat. But this service is not free. Remember that in case of real danger to the "Duty" base from monsters or elements hostile to "Duty", as well as threats of Bar territory seizure, we reserve the right of full mobilization (temporary) for the period of threat elimination. Such is the price of your peaceful stay here. \nColonel Ivantsov</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention17"><text>Stalkers. \n \nWhoever needs ammo of any caliber and any quantity, I'm always here - come in, I'll trade at a decent rate. (But only ammo for ammo. I don't take money, buy for money at the bar.) \nArnie</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention18"><text>Guys, stalkers. \n \nI sometimes leave the Bar, but not for long. So if someone brought me artifacts to trade and didn't find me, don't worry. I'll come back - I'll trade. I haven't gone anywhere, just business. Wait a bit. \nSanya Banker</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention19"><text>Brothers. \n \nHelp with whatever you can. I have nothing left, I'm begging around. I'll really work everything off, pay it back. Don't let a man die! \n \nYou should at least write your name, weirdo. Who's gonna help you like that... Completely stuck?</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention20"><text>Notice \n \nIf someone needs body armor patched up - you're welcome. Just don't bring armor torn to shreds - straight to the garbage. \nLanky</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention21"><text>Stalkers. \n \nThere are small tasks for quite decent payment. Come see me. \nColonel Petrenko</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention22"><text>Attention everyone! \n \nAbout the "Black Mark". If someone thinks of barging into "Duty" headquarters with this anomalous crap, we'll give him five minutes maximum, and so there's not even a trace of him near Bar territory - if he makes it. And until he gets rid of this filth, we won't let him within 100 meters. \nColonel Ivantsov</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention23"><text>Guys! \n \nWhoever carries the latest detector model from the nerds, check it. It doesn't beep on all "Witch's Jellies". I almost got caught twice before I figured out the detector wasn't beeping. So don't forget - bolt rules. \nWell-wisher</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention24"><text>Artifact's brewing - from bad to good, \nStalker rejoices - he'll get pennies. \nHe'll give them to the trader, take gear \nAnd off on a distant trek he'll go again. \n \nUnknown</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention25"><text>Stalkers. \n \nWhoever has a couple of dead guns, don't rush to throw them away, bring them, let's talk. Maybe we can cobble together something decent for a reasonable price. \nLisaped</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention26"><text>Guys. \n \nIf you find empty canisters in the Zone, bring them to the Bar, there's interest. And don't throw away dead batteries. I can trade them for good ones. \nYou'll find me by the bar generator</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention27"><text>Guys. \n \nWhoever was planning to go to Yantar, I don't recommend it for now, wait a couple days. Zombies came from somewhere, I barely escaped myself. They say a hole formed there somewhere - like a portal. The Duty guys will disperse them, then go ahead. \nWell-wisher</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention28"><text>Attention! If someone doesn't like the local repertoire, then nobody's forcing you. Go to Cordon and sing whatever you want there. And the freak who shoots at the bar's jukebox again, I'll personally put on the roof and make him scream all these songs by heart. \nColonel Petrenko</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention29"><text>Bloodsucker's very dangerous when attacking, \nBut an experienced stalker knows one trick! \nDuring the attack manage to get your knife, \nTo drive it into the throat as it approaches! \n \nUnknown</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention30"><text>Stalkers! The Bar is an island of safety. But safety doesn't come free. Therefore everyone who enters and exits Bar territory is obligated to shoot any unwanted creatures. At their own expense. No one will allocate additional ammo for this. You have to pay for security and protection! \nSergeant Kitsenko</text></string>
<string id="bar_attention31"><text>Fellas! \n \nCatch your luck! Only once a month! \nSpecial incredibly high stakes! Today we play for real. Discount for regular players. Don't miss the chance. \nBaldy</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_pda_info_text"><text>...Well I didn't come to the Zone for nothing, not for nothing... Auntie was right when she said: the gentle calf sucks two teats! Good to have two enemies as friends - Voronin and Lukash! You'll make a killing there, and here you'll get some scraps!\nIf I understood correctly, Voronin wants to buy off Lukash in order to subdue Borov's base. And he pays Lukash for his neutrality in this matter. I wonder, doesn't Lukash understand that when Voronin crushes Borov's piece under himself, he might also go after Army Warehouses? Well I don't give a damn, by that time I'll already be outta here.\n \nOh, I don't like this deputy of Voronin's, little eyes like pins. He's sniffing around for something, digging under Voronin? Decided to make a career? Invited me for drinks in the evening, something uncomfortable about such offers, but you can't refuse... Not yet anyway.\n \nSomething tells me that from the conversation with this security officer I've sobered up five years ahead... If I understood his thought, then Voronin is throwing dust in everyone's eyes! And they've long been in cahoots with Borov and live perfectly as neighbors, and all this foam... Turns out: Borov raises a wave - stalkers run scared under "Duty" protection, and "Duty" is glad! Everyone in a pile, loot, storage fees, info sources... Hmm, clever. The only thing I don't like is that Voronin's no fool, he understands I know too much... Gotta get out of the Zone... Time to go.\n \nI don't know what I'm carrying to Lukash, but obviously something valuable... But if Voronin isn't planning to hassle Borov, then it's unclear what he's paying Lukash for?? So, gotta split and split right now, later will be too late. I might not even make it out of the anarchists' base... At Army Warehouses there are mercs near the old bus stop. One option - go to them, I'll make a deal with them, they'll get me out of the Zone, fortunately there's something to negotiate with. Looks like this is my last chance. Tomorrow I take the case and head to the Warehouses, through Bloodsucker Village to the mercs. "P..." will help get there and negotiate. And I'll crack it open on the mainland and really hope there's not just junk in the case, but real goods, like friend Sidorovich says...</text></string>
