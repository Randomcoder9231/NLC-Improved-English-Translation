<string id="mil_kurjer_pda_info_text"><text>...How did I end up in this place, but no... Our unit received orders: establish contact with research base! Gather intel and complete our mission - survive and return! Everyone scattered, everyone disappeared!\nWent to the marked location, which should have coordinates for the bunker, but found only empty concrete walls. I already despaired and was ready to leave empty-handed. But I noticed, and now I understand, that apparently, to open the passage you need to enter some sort of security code, which I just can't figure out? But that's obvious, and I have no other choice.\n\nBut what disturbs me most is this feeling of being watched, the sensation that someone is near, that there are others. Something strange, some distant sounds? Strange radio interference? Several anomalous readings appear on the scanner, but we haven't encountered them before, they're not familiar... even somewhat frightening.\n\nSomething else, apparently, is not right with the electromagnetic field here either... Even if I find the code, the problem is that my radio doesn't work properly! And I noticed that communications and navigation systems are failing in unexpected ways, and this is not... Attention: after activating security systems - contact base immediately via "Alpha" channel, "Bravo" - emergency! This is in any case, mind you, so that rescue teams can reach us, covering the rear... Oh, brothers. This mission has become far more difficult than we expected at headquarters, but it seems that I found something... interesting enough to make it worthwhile... That's for sure.\n\nAnd that fact that I have a signal, but some kind of strange... But when I compare with previously recorded radiation levels, I understand that something is clearly wrong here?? Yes, if readings are true and I'm not imagining things, then something big happened. And I doubt I can handle this situation alone... But there's no choice but to proceed with the mission parameters. Most important is that I know where I'm going, what to expect on arrival, so that it doesn't take me by surprise. Better prepare myself for serious obstacles. All that matters now is getting out alive, but I doubt that everything will go smoothly from here. "S..." signal disappeared and went silent. And so I continue this log in an unknown place and at unknown time, since I no longer know where I am, and even worse, that this place keeps changing...</text></string>
