<string id="treasure_1167_2"><text>Stash: Smoked's Hideout \nJotted down the coordinates of an underground stash from some drunk stalker. Gotta be a tasty find.</text></string>
<string id="treasure_1167_3"><text>Stash: Smoked's Hideout \nSmoked, the idiot, hauled all our artifacts into the underground lab and locked them in a safe there. Found a place, sure... Rocks fly around there out of nowhere-how are we supposed to get them out now?..</text></string>

<string id="treasure_1168_1"><text>Stash: Abandoned Backpack \nHad to ditch the backpack with junk in the lab. Those damn things turned out to be heavy.</text></string>
<string id="treasure_1168_2"><text>Stash: Abandoned Backpack \nHad to leave the big lump inside and get the hell out in a hurry.</text></string>
<string id="treasure_1168_3"><text>Stash: Abandoned Backpack \nHad to throw the backpack away in the underground laboratory.</text></string>

<string id="treasure_1370_1"><text>Stash: Dangerous Secret \nPolters pinned me down, couldn't haul everything away. Dumped it all here.</text></string>
<string id="treasure_1370_2"><text>Stash: Dangerous Secret \nRumor has it someone from Strelok's own group kept their gear here.</text></string>
<string id="treasure_1370_3"><text>Stash: Dangerous Secret \nBodya, that drunk mug, let it slip about a stash in one of the X-labs, heh-heh. I'll write it down-oughta pay it a visit...</text></string>

<string id="treasure_1371_1"><text>Stash: Mystery in the Laboratory \nI was here once, a long time ago. Creepy as hell place. I clearly remember dumping something here, but what exactly-it's gone from my head. Now try and guess...</text></string>
<string id="treasure_1371_2"><text>Stash: Mystery in the Laboratory \nHad to abandon my favorite SMG along with a whole pile of ammo for it. Who knew you'd need a flamethrower in here?</text></string>
<string id="treasure_1371_3"><text>Stash: Mystery in the Laboratory \nVaska said that on his last visit here he ditched part of his ammo. Idiot... how's he gonna get it back now?</text></string>

<string id="treasure_1372_1"><text>Stash: Valuables in X-18 \nIgnat's people are idiots! How am I supposed to retrieve the order from that basement now?!</text></string>
<string id="treasure_1372_2"><text>Stash: Valuables in X-18 \nBought a tip off some sucker. It's somewhere around here, but damn if it ain't scary to crawl in.</text></string>
<string id="treasure_1372_3"><text>Stash: Valuables in X-18 \nWas drinking with a stalker, and he told me there's something interesting lying around here. Was he bullshitting?</text></string>
