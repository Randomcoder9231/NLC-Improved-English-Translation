<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_0"><text>It seems you needed me for something?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_1"><text>Marked One... You are one of those. You are needed by the enlightened. Accept the appointment and fulfill what is prescribed, as we all do!</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_2"><text>Hold on, hold on! What’s going on here? What appointment? What are you talking about? I didn’t ask for any appointment. I just need to find out a couple of things, that’s all.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_3"><text>There is a message. There was. From the One That Is. The one who bears the Mark will come. Will be able to receive what he desires. And will bring understanding. It is necessary to guide... There is no unity at this moment of the flow of time. A transponder is needed. You will be able to make it. Then there will be unity. There will be replenishment. There will be direction... You, Marked One... Take the seed. Carry it to the place. Leave it. It will sprout. Then there will be unity and... A reward.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_4"><text>What “seed”? What “place”? What “reward”? What is all this? Why?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_5"><text>The seed. His. It will give the possibility of uniting minds. If it is sown at the points... The right ones... </text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_6"><text>Then why don’t you “sow” it here yourselves? And in general, you should do it yourselves. Your seeds, you sow them.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_7"><text>Not here. The seed is needed for Him at the points of connection with Him. It awaits you, but there is only one path to Him.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_8"><text>Wait, wait... Brrr! “It” is waiting for me? I actually wanted to find out how I can get past that barrier that won’t let me go any further... There, to the station.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_9"><text>Yes. It has been waiting for a long time. You are on the path of understanding... There was a seed, It sprouted in the Foggy Thicket... It received energy... But one is not enough... It needs more. Now it needs more... Those like you can. You do not need His attention, as we do. But you also bear His seal, It will let you pass. You are Marked One, It will let you pass.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_10"><text>So it is a “seal” after all?.. But I don’t feel any seal. Maybe there is nothing at all, and all of this is just... a coincidence? Absurdity?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_11"><text>You were marked by Him. Now I do not see His sign... But It remembers and will let you pass.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_12"><text>And why would It let me pass? To brand me again?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_13"><text>You want to know yourself. Only It will tell the truth. You will understand everything with Him. Who you truly are. Do not waste time. Strive toward Him.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_14"><text>Alright... Stranger things have happened. If there’s no other way to learn that truth, but there’s a chance to understand something by doing this... What kind of seeds are these and where do I plant them?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_15"><text>Places of energy. Of flows. Exit points... Of His shoots. You call these places “Matrices”.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_16"><text>Those are anomalies, right... And anyway, it still depends where to take them. I haven’t decided yet.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_17"><text>You humans say “Ivankovsky District Center”, there. You will be able to. Leave the seed... And you say “Tesla”. There... And you say “Radar”. Leave it. And plant it... The seed is alive. It will not die. In the right place it will sprout... At the right time. Do not wait. Time itself will come.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_18"><text>Oh, damn... I don’t know... I’ll think about it some more. \nAnd this... if I lose it, or it gets stolen, or I sell it — you never know, things happen — then what? Come back to you again?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_19"><text>It must not be lost... Do what must be done. There will be no others.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_20"><text>Everything’s so complicated with you... Why does “it” give so few seeds? Aren’t you afraid to part with such a rarity?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_21"><text>Not few... But by your temporal measures the process is long. In this span of time — there are none. The seed always exists. It will not be exhausted. But later. Much later.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_22"><text>Yeah, “it” has nowhere to hurry. It has eternity ahead... Alright, but if I do plant your seeds, then what? Look for you here again?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_23"><text>I will summon you when I understand that It has accepted the seed. Return and you will receive what is important. That with which you will be able to reach Him...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_24"><text>You could’ve started with that. Instead it’s him, from him, yours — damn it... My head’s spinning with you.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_25"><text>Take it and go. Do not waste time.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_sema_dialog_26"><text>Your seeds sure are heavy...</text></string>

<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_0"><text>So how’s Ivar doing?</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_1"><text>And what about him? Looks like your Ivar is feeling better.</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_2"><text>Why “my” Ivar?</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_3"><text>Well, you’re always fussing over him. The Doctor said he’ll live.</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_4"><text>Yeah... So the Doctor came by?</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_5"><text>Yes. Didn’t stay long at all and left right away. Why he hides from people is unclear... Didn’t you run into him here?</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_6"><text>Not here.</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_7"><text>He came to take a look at Ivar. Injected him with something and left. Said there was nothing more to be done. Said these are consequences of radiation. Some kind of... local cerebral circulation disorder. Like a microstroke, basically. But he should gradually recover on his own, since he wasn’t crippled right away. Just shouldn’t strain himself mentally for now. And what is there for him to strain himself with... He just sits there and sits.</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_8"><text>That’s already good. And where did the Doctor go?</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_9"><text>How should I know? Hiding somewhere as usual. I heard through the grapevine, just between us, that he was hanging around Borov’s lot for a while. Either laying low with them or something else... Looks like he crossed someone or learned something he wasn’t supposed to. So he didn’t stick around here, left in a hurry.</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_10"><text>With Borov’s people? Seriously? Did you make that up yourself?</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_11"><text>Alright, I said it, you forgot it. Rumors, you know, don’t just appear out of nowhere.</text></string>
<string id="after_deadcity_barman_dialog_12"><text>Nonsense... And even if he was with them, so what? A doctor is a doctor — help without borders, so to speak.</text></string>

<string id="strelok_sheets_news_0"><text>
... \n \n
Well then, as for the so-called “monolith”, or as they have now begun to write in monographs — the Monolith — what would you say about it? What is its role in all of this? \n \n
There are many hypotheses, but given the current circumstances, the most reasonable one to me seems to be the following: \n
The Monolith absorbs hundreds of human psi-images, essentially feeds on them, replenishing its psi-energy. These include everyone who was in that area at the moment of the Monolith’s emergence about a hundred years ago, as well as those who somehow end up within this field even now — even though unprecedented protective measures have since been adopted, there are more and more “holes” leading there... Are you familiar with the theory of teleportation? \n \n
Well... briefly. Let’s not dwell on it. \n \n
So then. Those whom the Monolith has absorbed do not return — they become nobody, they are gone — and this is where the zombified come from. Their psycho-images were absorbed by the Monolith and it emptied their, uh... soul... far too strongly. \n \n
“Absorbed”? “Emptied the soul”. Isn’t that a bit... unscientific for a hypothesis of this level? \n \n
But somehow one has to explain to the layman, in imagery familiar to him, what “the superposition of a consciousness matrix” actually is. \n \n
Alright. Let’s go with that. But then what exactly is the Monolith itself? Some specific object? \n \n
It can hardly be classified as a material object. The Monolith does not need our physical universe, any material things, bodies, or space. Whatever it may be there, it requires a psychic universe — or, to put it more simply — mental images, everything on that kind of subtle level. Whether it feeds on this or exists within this “field” is still unclear; it remains a mystery even after so many years of study. \n
And since the Monolith itself is considered a non-material object — with only a certain visible projection of it being material, located in some kind of sarcophagus, not the Monolith itself as such — it essentially acts like an informational virus. \n \n
Wait, wait... Why did you decide that it is non-material? Why not simply assume that it is some kind of meteorite? There were such hypotheses as well. \n \n
This is one of the core postulates based on Professor Sokov’s “theory of the collision of worlds”. And at present, this is the most reasonable theory. The meteorite hypothesis collapsed a very long time ago. It is now generally accepted that the Monolith is the result of a “collision”, a “contact” of worlds, and similar terms. But nothing from “that world” — what we would call the antimatter world — can appear materially in this one. Otherwise, annihilation would be inevitable. But since it did not occur and we still exist, we cannot speak of materiality, though we can explain the collision in terms of information, the noosphere, if you will... Do you understand me? \n \n
With difficulty. But I’m trying. Let’s go back one step. \n \n
Yes. Alright. So, the Monolith, as a kind of informational virus, infects at the level of the mind. It changes not the structure of the brain as a physical object, but the minds of people. Roughly speaking, it replaces part of consciousness. It absorbs what exists, and inserts its own in the vacated space. A simple, clear analogy would be a computer virus. \n \n
We’ll take a short break... We’ve received several calls. \n \n
... 
</text></string>
<string id="strelok_sheets_news_1"><text>
... \n \n
How is this “expansion” even possible? After all, you yourself spoke of the object’s non-material nature. \n \n
Quite right. But how are we to explain its behavior in terms of our laws of physics? It is unknown what exists there, in the other universe of the Monolith, but in ours — the one it entered — the law of conservation of energy and the laws of thermodynamics apply. Therefore, it simply has to survive in our world somehow, as if it were a living object — to “grow”, to expand, to seize new territories, new sources of nourishment. Otherwise, inevitable entropy and death. In this world, at least. \n \n
Alright. Let us assume that, but earlier we spoke about a certain field of “powerlessness”. \n \n
Yes, yes. A little more on that. Then it turns out that this field of “apathy”, or rather “powerlessness”, as you put it, is precisely the result of the Monolith’s influence. The result of its “vital activity” in this world. It draws masses of people toward itself, infects them — that is, introduces a part of itself into their consciousness, replaces it with a virus, and so on — and then releases them. That is, it ceases that very “call” we spoke of. This is how the Monolith expands its sphere of influence, grows — for it has neither hands, nor legs, nor a body, yet it must somehow survive, having entered this world... You do understand that this is merely an abstract model? \n \n
Yes. I understand. \n \n
By the force of its influence, it encourages more and more people to strive toward its sphere of influence. This is its “food source”. That is why it induces illusions. And for some reason everyone “wants” to come closer to it, despite having no idea what is there — yet everyone shares the same thought: that it is good there, whatever it may be. \n
But this is not enough for it. The Monolith “throws out” traps, lures — the so-called artifacts — for the sake of which people not yet subject to the influence of the “call” may strive toward it. And the number of these “toys”, by which I mean the variety of types, already defies analysis. \n
It projects the illusion of some endless, free happiness somewhere nearby, close to it. And then it plunges people into apathy and, having “fed”, releases them beyond the perimeter with an already replaced consciousness. That is, it changes the polarity of the field from “come to me, here happiness is free” to “leave this place, there is only disappointment here”. \n \n
I’m afraid not everyone will be able to digest this. It’s like with the theory of relativity. It seems clear when explained on one’s fingers, but once you go into the details... \n \n
Naturally. The complete theory is far more complex, but I am explaining it to you precisely “on one’s fingers”. Otherwise we would stray into such depths that we would not have enough time for any conversation at all. Its format is limited as it is... \n \n
... 
</text></string>
<string id="strelok_sheets_news_2"><text>
...  \n \n
Let’s talk a bit more about the “fragment”, and then it will be time for us to wrap up... \n \n
As I already said, the “fragment” is not a material stone, not a special artifact — it is something mental. It is that very virus which the carriers are meant to carry beyond the limits of the restricted territory and allow the Monolith to “grow”. \n \n
But how do they understand that they have a “fragment”? After all, everyone who had it speaks specifically of a material object. \n \n
No. All those who “had” it, had it as an illusion. They, roughly speaking, lost their minds, possessing such a mental image — a replica of the little Monolith. \n
And further, when they leave the sphere of its influence, all this madness does not go anywhere in any degree — it is inherited and grows progressively. Which is exactly what we are now observing everywhere. People are “growing stupider” right before our eyes. Universally. \n
And there you have the answer to how the Monolith, not being a living or material object of our world, nevertheless captures this world. This is the true “expansion of the Zone” with which we began our conversation. It is not territorial expansion at all. \n \n
Do you believe we can no longer stop this? This, how should I put it, “seizure of minds”. \n \n
It is hard to say. The rate of progression of mental disorders that we are observing inspires no optimism whatsoever. In essence, humanity as a species is degenerating. And the cause of it all, as the majority of scientists now believe, is that very initial virus introduced about a hundred years ago. This is a turning point in the history of mankind... \n \n
...
</text></string>
<string id="strelok_sheets_news_3"><text>
...  \n \n
Right, that’s exactly what I wanted to ask about — the so-called guardians of the Monolith. What kind of people are they? \n \n
That’s precisely what I’m telling you: the Monolithians are not quite human. Their consciousness has been restructured by the Monolith according to a special “program”, meaning they perform a certain controlling function and act as living receptors of the Monolith — through which it “sees”, “hears”, and “perceives” this world that is alien to it. They have a kind of mental connection with the Monolith. And some of them no longer even need to speak. \n \n
So these are the very same “zombies”? \n \n
No, not at all. They are not mindless zombies — “drained souls” — but they are not people in the usual sense either. Rather, they are bodies with replaced consciousness, levers, a working mechanism. They lose the ability to think rationally and become something like “worker bees” — an organism with a single function. This is, of course, very conditional. But they are precisely the ones who do not go insane like those who receive a “fragment”. \n \n
But you yourself say that they have a replaced consciousness... \n \n
Well, yes. Monolithians can carry their own special “pieces of the Monolith”, that is, their own special code that governs their behavior. But at the same time they must remain sane — on their own level, of course. Their role is to somehow lure new potential carriers of the “fragment”, and then to filter out those who are ready to leave, who have “ripened”, so to speak. And also to guard the approaches against those who are mentally opposed to the Monolith. \n \n
But surely something human remains in them? \n \n
Naturally. Not everyone becomes a Monolithian at once. In our universe nothing happens instantaneously, since the factor of time exists. Perhaps in the universe of the Monolith there is no time, but we are not meant to understand that. Therefore, a transitional process is assumed, when a person is not yet a Monolithian, but is no longer quite human either. Probably, in order to achieve some understanding of themselves on a human level, they need to explain these phenomena and this essence in some way. For example, through the creation of a cult, a religion — that is the easiest way for a human being to “understand” the incomprehensible. \n \n
By what criteria, then, does the Monolith choose those who will serve it, and those who will carry its “fragment”? \n \n
Here I can say nothing. If such criteria exist, they are unknown to us. It is impossible either to understand or to predict what something entirely from another world “thinks”. In that world, in theory, logic itself must be completely different — if it exists at all. \n \n
Alright, but if at the initial stage of “monolithization”, so to speak, one were somehow to erase the record or, as you put it, the Monolith’s “psychomatrix”, what would happen to the person? Would they become normal again and behave precisely like a human being? \n \n
Hard to say. It probably all depends on the depth of the influence. If the implanted “code” is insignificant, then most likely the human aspect of such an individual would prevail. But they would not remember certain things, because in place of the erased, conditionally speaking, “code”, the person would not regain the previous data that had been overwritten by that “code”... \n \n

<string id="docent_x10_start_dlg_0"><text>I’ve come across some papers, could you make sense of them?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_start_dlg_1"><text>What kind of papers? Where from?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_start_dlg_2"><text>Look, these documents are from one underground laboratory. I don’t know their contents, but there definitely must be something in them about the operation of the "Brain Scorcher". Right now it’s shut down and without power, and that’s a big mistake. It needs to be turned on, otherwise everyone will die. That’s the short version...</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_start_dlg_3"><text>I’m not sure I want to get into the long version. Alright, I don’t really care either way.\nLet’s see what we’ve got here. Hm... There’s a ton of stuff here... This will take time. Judging by your flustered look, you want an answer as soon as possible, right? Let’s do it this way: I’ll put all my other work aside and deal with yours, and you’ll go for a walk for an hour or so... let’s say, three. Meanwhile, you’ll prepare the payment for my services — a third-level artifact. And make sure not a fly has sat on it, because I know you stalkers, you’ll bring something that’s been used to death, worn to the bone, on its last legs...</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_start_dlg_4"><text>No problem, you’ll get a zero-mileage artifact.</text></string>

<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_0"><text>So, any progress on my question about turning on the "Brain Scorcher"?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_1"><text>It was rather tricky, to be honest, but now I can generally satisfy your curiosity. Did you bring the payment?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_21"><text>A third-level artifact, fresh off the press. Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_22"><text>Hold on a bit, I’ll go fetch a suitable artifact.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_3"><text>Alright then. The bad news: starting the main power supply circuit is a lost cause. Only a team of specialists could handle that. The good news: somewhere beneath the Dark Valley, if I’ve matched the landmarks correctly, there is a backup geothermal generator. Logically, it should be in a standby state right now, but switching it to operational mode is many times easier than the main one. All that’s required is to open the circulation of the heat-transfer fluid, after which it will be possible to switch the facility’s power supply to the backup line.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_4"><text>Open the circulation of the heat-transfer fluid... So I just need to turn some main valve, right? And what about the power? How do I switch it?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_5"><text>Regarding the heat-transfer fluid, I think you’ve got it right. You literally need to look for the “main valve” and turn it. The automation doesn’t work if everything’s without power. As for the power supply, from the service correspondence of some engineer who was listed in the maintenance team assigned to the "Rainbow" complex, I managed to find out that in the same place where the backup generator is located, there is also a control post for it. What it looks like — I have no idea, but you can get inside if you have the access code:</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_6"><text>That’s more or less clear. And then what? How do I fire the "Brain Scorcher" back up?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_7"><text>What I don’t know, I don’t know. There’s nothing about that in the documents. By analogy with the “main valve”, you probably need to look for the main switch. In theory, Ivar should know. After all, it was his guys who shut the installation down.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_8"><text>As for where the switch itself is located, I do have an idea — I’ve already been tipped off. The installation’s operation was controlled from yet another underground facility, the entrance to which is on Radar.\nListen, Docent, there’s one thought that won’t leave me alone. I consulted with one knowledgeable guy, and he dropped a phrase saying that the effect of the "Brain Scorcher" on people might just be a malfunction, an error. As if something is configured incorrectly. Working in the wrong phase or modulation. Something like that. What do you think, is that realistic?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_9"><text>Absolutely! I mean, if someone had deliberately planned to cover a specific area of the Zone with an impassable field for humans, who would need that and why? And to use such... to put it mildly, inhumane methods. To scare off outsiders, the good old ultrasound at a certain frequency would’ve been more than enough. But instead they’re breeding zombified... Using this kind of radiation as a pinpoint weapon — that’s one thing, but to “carpet-bomb” like this... No, something doesn’t add up here. I’m much more inclined to believe in an unintentional error, a malfunction, or even a side effect.\nHm... What if... It just might work...</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_10"><text>What is it? What idea did you have?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_11"><text>Yeah. You know how it is when the right words reach a “critical mass”? Modulation, phase, frequency. And then — bam! An epiphany.\nAnyway, I remembered that your documents contained instructions for switching the installation’s operating modes. This is done using special blocks with programs recorded on them. They are installed into harmonizer-setters, which are actually responsible for tuning the radiation parameters. If you can get the right blocks, you can reset these parameters to “factory” or test settings, if you like. I’m almost certain that with such settings the radiation should become as safe as possible for organic life forms.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_12"><text>And where am I supposed to get these “right blocks” for you? Go look for some warehouse under Radar and shake down the local storekeeper? And he’ll rush at me with outstretched claws, chanting: soldier... sol-dier! Uh... sorry, my jokes are stupid.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_13"><text>Jokes aside, you guessed right about the warehouse. Only it’s not under Radar, but — you won’t believe it — once again under the Dark Valley. Hold on, I saw a waybill somewhere... Aha, here it is. The suitable blocks are marked 12-X-14TO. You’ll need to insert a couple of those into the third and fourth harmonizer, replacing the installed ones. The harmonizer-setters themselves, according to the records, are located at the facility indexed X-8. There’s even a photo of them here, you can keep it.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x10_done_dlg_14"><text>Ugh... Why is everything always so complicated?! Go there, then here, take this, go back... Alright, I got you. I’d better write the plan of action down in my PDA so I don’t get confused. And try to stick to it.</text></string>
<string id="tex_radar_on_plan_article"><text>Docent helped make sense of Strelok’s papers. And even came up with a way to theoretically save the people who rushed beyond Radar, and who will inevitably die or turn into mindless zombies after the "Rainbow" is restarted. The plan is as follows:\n1. Open the circulation of the heat-transfer fluid in the underground complex beneath the Dark Valley (look for the “main valve” and turn it).\n2. The control post of the backup generator is located there as well. I copied down the code for the entrance door. You need to get inside and start that very generator.\n3. Make your way to the warehouse and find two blocks for the harmonizer-setters marked 12-X-14TO.\n4. Insert the found blocks into harmonizers number three and four, located at the facility indexed X-8.\n5. By analogy with the “main valve”, look for the “main switch” to start the "Rainbow" installation. Its operation was controlled from a laboratory on Radar, the entrance to which is cut straight into the slope of a hill, which can be reached from the fork by moving along the road to the north.</text></string>

<string id="ivar_gen_iskatel_help_7"><text>Yeah... Listen, Marked One. Not as a duty, but as a favor... could you bring me a suit? I need it... badly.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_gen_iskatel_help_8"><text>Are you serious, planning to go somewhere?! You still need to sit here and sit until you come to your senses.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_gen_iskatel_help_9"><text>I’m already... better. And you can’t just sit forever. There’s work to be done... My comrade... from our group... died when we were breaking through to the "Brain Scorcher", in the northern part of the forest... find him, if it’s not too much trouble... He had a suit... we got it from Sakharov... new... experimental... I need one like that, for the job.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_gen_iskatel_help_10"><text>Radar?! That’s quite a request you’ve got... Maybe I’ll bring it. I can see you can’t be held back here anyway...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_gen_iskatel_help_11"><text>You... do try. I’ll repay you... I left something here... with the Docent... some time ago...</text></string>

<string id="ivar_outfit_done_dialog_0"><text>Hi, Ivar. I found the armor and... the body, of your friend.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_outfit_done_dialog_1"><text>Yeah... that’s a shame. Well then, now I can start getting ready... </text></string>
<string id="ivar_outfit_done_dialog_2"><text>Take the armor, but if I were you, I wouldn’t rush to leave the Bar. You’re still weak.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_outfit_done_dialog_3"><text>I can’t... sit around without work. Thanks... you helped me out. Take this... artifact.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_outfit_done_dialog_4"><text>I’ll be going, and you get some rest.</text></string>

<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_0"><text>Ivar, I have a question for you. Did you know Strelok well?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_1"><text>No, not at all. Just a passing acquaintance.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_2"><text>Then why did he give you those papers?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_3"><text>I told you why I came here. It all started with former stalkers who returned from the Zone, where they had developed severe mental disorders of a schizo... phrenic nature. That’s how they came to the attention of my colleagues. Every single one of them spoke of some incomprehensible fragment that they had supposedly lost. At first I thought it was some special artifact. Then I learned about the “Black Mark”. I thought it was what was driving people insane. In the end I came to the conclusion that the only way to understand what was going on was to personally visit the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_4"><text>That’s all clear. You said that eventually you decided the “Brain Scorcher” was to blame. But where does Strelok fit into this story? How did he find you?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_5"><text>How — that I don’t know. In principle, many people had heard about our group back then, so finding us if one wanted to wasn’t difficult at all.\nAt that time I still knew almost nothing about the “Brain Scorcher”, but I was looking for any information about radiation whose source was somewhere on Radar. How did I first meet Strelok? One night he simply showed up at our temporary camp at the Army Warehouses in the middle of the night. The sentries missed him — he seemed to appear out of nowhere. He went straight to the point, saying that he knew about our research and was ready to help. In exchange for the materials of my re... search on the connection between the “Black Mark” and the obsessive states of its bearer.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_6"><text>As far as I know, that artifact is a nightmare for any stalker. Only a few survive who manage to “earn” it. Why was Strelok interested in it?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_7"><text>It’s not that simple. Yes, on the one hand, the “Mark” has an extremely negative ef... fect on the body and in some cases even leads to death, but those who were lucky enough to survive it acquire... how should I put it... a kind of immunity, perhaps, to certain types of psi-activity. Note — precisely those who survived the “Mark”, not those who found a way to get rid of it. Obviously, this trait manifests itself at the moment the degenerated artifact breaks down.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_8"><text>I see. You mean that if you’ve “been through” the “Black Mark”, you can safely go for a stroll even under the “Brain Scorcher”?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_9"><text>No. The radiation of the “Brain Scorcher” has a different nature. It’s a man-made object and, as we now know, it was configured to block the spread of the field of apathy. Immunity protects against certain types of, if I may say so, natural psi-activity. That is, things directly connected with the Zone. With the Monolith, if you like. As you probably understand, this topic is not the easiest to study. There is extremely little statistical and, more importantly, objective data, but I still managed to draw some conclusions.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_10"><text>So those with immunity aren’t afraid of controllers? Dogs don’t fry their brains? No double vision after teleportations? Something like that?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_11"><text>Well... I’d say that the nega... tive effects of the phenomena you listed would be reduced to some extent, but that’s not the main point. The “Black Mark” is something like a friend-or-foe test for the Monolith. By what principle those tested are selected, I don’t know, but the fact remains — the immune are not susceptible to the Monolith’s “virus” and cannot be its carriers. Those very “lost fragment” types. If you’ve forgotten what that’s about, reread Strelok’s notes.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_12"><text>No, I remember. So was Strelok really that afraid of getting infected with this “virus”?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_13"><text>I think he simply wanted to obtain the “friend” marker for the Monolith. Who knows how recognition mechanisms work in alien organisms, but I suppose it must be similar to how the human immune system functions. It can always distinguish its own cells from harmful pathogens. Though, of course, under certain conditions there can be failures. Take cancer, for example...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_14"><text>So that means... That means Strelok wanted, roughly speaking, to disguise himself as one of its own in order to get close to the Monolith and... What then? Destroy it? Neutralize it? But how?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_15"><text>I’d like to know the answer to that myself. In any case, he had a problem with the “Black Mark”. As I understood it, for some reason he himself could not obtain it in a nat... ural way, if one can put it that way. After some time, having familiarized himself with my research, he began searching for carriers of the “Mark”. Well, you won’t meet many of those in the nearest stalker camp, obviously. Later I heard rumors that he and some scientist were working on creating a device capable of protecting artifacts from rapid degeneration. I can assume that his main motive once again was to find a way to con... serve the “Mark”, to preserve it in our world for as long as possible.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_16"><text>What an intriguer... So where did he eventually disappear to, any ideas? I can’t believe he could just perish in some dark basement, running into a bloodsucker.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_17"><text>It seems to me that Strelok tried to get to the Monolith to the very end. And it ended badly for him. According to him, he was making his way beyond the “Rainbow” through old underground communications. And supposedly there is even a path underground all the way to the Sarcophagus through some tunnels, but I remember Strelok saying they were flooded and therefore useless. Don’t ask for details, I don’t know them. First, this information didn’t seem wor... thy of attention to me at the time, and second, he wasn’t particularly fond of being frank about side topics not directly related to our agreement.\nIn short, if you want my opinion, Strelok died somewhere on the approaches to the CNPP or right there. Alternatively, he fell under the control of the Monolith.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_strelok_dialog_18"><text>Yeah... The mysteries only keep multiplying. I need to think all this over. You get some rest for now.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_0"><text>I wanted to ask you something about temporal teleporters.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_1"><text>What exactly interests you? It’s a rather slippery topic and it’s easy to drift from scientific assumptions into fantasy.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_2"><text>You do know something about them.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_3"><text>Know? Hardly. More like hypothesize. So what interests you?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_4"><text>Well, how to explain it... The Zone, it sort of grows. That’s what I’ve heard. And that means the number of all kinds of bubbles, passages, holes in space grows too.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_5"><text>I can’t fault your logic. And?..</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_6"><text>Well, that means there could be more time teleporters as well. Or maybe it’s already easier to get into them, not accidentally, but deliberately...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_7"><text>I see...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_8"><text>Do you think someone could deliberately come to us from the future?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_9"><text>For what purpose?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_10"><text>Well... For example, to put an end to all this. Stop it. Destroy the Monolith... For instance.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_11"><text>I find it interesting to follow the course of your reasoning, but I must disappoint you. Even if we assume something like that, he still wouldn’t be able to change anything.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_12"><text>Why?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_13"><text>Because you can’t change cause and effect! It’s impossible to break the sequence of events. At least if we’re talking about the world around us, and not speculating about black holes... Do you understand?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_14"><text>Not really... After all, if there is some teleporter that can take you into the past, why couldn’t someone use it? And destroy, for example, that same Monolith?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_15"><text>Oh, these stalker myths about the Monolith... You’re so fixated on it. Stalkers invented a fairy tale and tell it to each other. Why would you want to destroy it then? If according to your stalker beliefs it “grants wishes”? Or what does it do there? Hands out happiness to everyone...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_16"><text>Me personally, I don’t really need to. I’m just... For example, if someone decided that the Monolith was the cause of all troubles, or something like that... I’ve read some things about it.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_17"><text>Get that nonsense out of your head... \nAlthough, let’s speculate for amusement. Suppose that in the future someone decided that a certain Monolith had become... uh, bad, dangerous. And decided to travel into the past to change the situation. So then, proceeding from the fact that you can’t change cause and effect, it turns out that it became dangerous there in the future precisely because here, “in the past”, someone attempted to destroy it... Follow my thought?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_18"><text>I’m trying.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_19"><text>This is a reaction to what was done. A response of that Monolith, or whoever else — that’s not the point... That is, the visitor from the future theoretically becomes the very cause of what happened there in his time, but in the future he doesn’t realize this and thinks that he is fixing the situation now, whereas in reality he himself is creating it. In short — a time loop... You look discouraged. </text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_20"><text>Yeah, it’s all kind of complicated...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_21"><text>I’m only trying to prove to you the impossibility of your assumptions. And speaking more simply, in everyday terms, nothing that has already happened can be changed. No matter how hard you try. No-thing!</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_future_dialog_22"><text>That’s exactly what upsets me...</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_101"><text>Well then, my friend, so we’ve finally met.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_102"><text>Ghost, as I understand?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_103"><text>You recognized me? Strange, you shouldn’t have. Or do you remember me after all?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_104"><text>You called me here to talk about my memories?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_105"><text>Not without that. I’m very curious about what’s there — in your memories. And whether they’re even yours.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_106"><text>Listen! If we know each other, speak plainly! Why are you dodging? And besides, if you’re really who you claim to be, then you must know Strelok. Where is he, and how am I connected to him and your group?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_107"><text>Just like that, straight into it? First I’d like to hear what you actually remember. Then I’ll answer some of your questions.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_108"><text>What business is it of yours what I remember? Yes, I lost my memory, woke up in a little village on the Cordon. Thanks to Sidorovich and the Doctor for not letting me die. Little by little, some things are starting to surface in my head. Doc thinks that the more I roam the Zone, the more I talk to people, the higher the chance I’ll run into acquaintances from my “past life”. Talking to them could spur my consciousness and another piece of the puzzle will fall into place. There’s one more lead to my past — Strelok. That’s all you need to know.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_109"><text>Ah! So the Doctor didn’t tell you everything? Wants to keep his hands clean. Like he had nothing to do with it at all. Crafty old man...\nAnswer for answer. We really do know each other, if you can put it that way. But I know almost nothing about you. You’ve met Ivar, right? He, on the other hand, knows perfectly well who you are.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_110"><text>Ivar?! He really did drop something during our conversation like “you remind me of someone, but no, you can’t be him”. I didn’t attach much importance to it, since he himself was... not quite himself.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_111"><text>Yeah. What irony. Tried to cure poor zombies and nearly joined their ranks himself. And it was he who brought you to Strelok in the first place. Didn’t confess, did he? Tsk-tsk!</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_112"><text>WHAT?! What is that supposed to mean? Explain yourself!</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_113"><text>Instead of listening to my explanations, you’d better pin Ivar to the wall properly and ask him straight out yourself. Though... you might later regret choosing knowledge over soothing ignorance. Here and now you are a brave and lucky stalker, Marked One. But what if there, beyond the perimeter, you’re, say, a simple plumber? Living in a one-room Khrushchevka somewhere near Chernihiv with a dim-witted wife and a son who’s a juvenile delinquent. You don’t have a penny to your name, just debts. Every evening you booze it up at a local dive with a bunch of the same losers, out of hopelessness and the realization that nothing good awaits you in life anymore.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_114"><text>Did you spend long inventing my biography? And even if all of that turned out to be true, I still have to know who I am, who I was.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_115"><text>Are you sure? Then allow me to add a couple of details to my “fiction”. One day you drink yourself into delirium tremens and end up in a madhouse, and in your apartment they find the bodies of your family. After coming to your senses a bit and realizing what you’ve done, you escape from the hospital and hide in the Zone. What do you say?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_116"><text>You’re lying about everything! I know you’re a vile and slippery type who wouldn’t hesitate to commit any filth to achieve your goals. I just can’t yet figure out what you’re plotting with regard to me.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_117"><text>To begin with, I’m interested in what drives you. I’ve been watching you for a long time. You climb into the very hell no one else would dare enter. For what? Really, it’s not just the desire to regain your memory and understand yourself that makes you go time and again where even I wouldn’t risk setting foot. You invented that excuse just so you wouldn’t seem like a lunatic to yourself. In reality, you’re quite comfortable even without your lost memories. And don’t say you’ve never thought about it.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_118"><text>Maybe you’re right. Sometimes I myself don’t understand what pushes me so stubbornly to continue the search. The secrets of the Zone? The mythical call of the Monolith? The hope of finally understanding myself? Possibly all of it together.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_119"><text>I’ll throw in another possible reason. You’re being led by a part of Strelok’s consciousness that was merged with your personality as a result of an extremely unusual experiment. Strelok himself considered it a failure, but between us, he was a master of obfuscation and left many things unsaid. I’d really like to know what he was trying to achieve and how he intended to use you.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_120"><text>You know, that’s already too much! I...</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_121"><text>Ivar didn’t happen to let you read Strelok’s notes, did he?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_122"><text>What? Uh... Notes? The ones about the Monolith and our possible future?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_123"><text>Ours or not ours, but yours — definitely. And quite possibly the very near one.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_124"><text>My future? I don’t understand...</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_125"><text>I’m talking about that passage where the guardians of the Monolith are mentioned. As I understand it, that’s exactly what awaits you in the near future.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_126"><text>There was nothing there about any guardians. Are you trying to mess with my head again?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_127"><text>So Strelok didn’t give Ivar everything. Then read what I’m uploading to your PDA now. For the sake of completeness, so to speak. Back in the day I allowed myself to make copies of the files from Strelok’s flash drive, which he carelessly left in... one of our group’s secret hideouts while hastily preparing for a raid.\nOnce you’ve read it, go see Ivar and ask him why he brought you to Strelok. While you’re at it, drop by the Doctor as well. Tell them you met me and that I laid my cards on the table. Otherwise they’ll start wriggling again. I guarantee you’ll learn a lot of interesting things about yourself. Then think it all over properly and come back. We’ll talk in more concrete terms.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_128"><text>Alright, I’ll do as you say. But keep in mind, if anything happens... In short, I’ll find you. And then our conversation will take on a very different tone.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_129"><text>You will, you will. I’m not going anywhere. I’ll be here. After all, you guessed the main thing — I do have certain plans for you.</text></string>

<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, back again? Find anything out?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_202"><text>I will. I definitely will.</text></string>

<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_301"><text>Back already? Talk to Ivar and the Doctor?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_302"><text>I did, I definitely did. Now it’s time to have a word with you, to dot all the i’s, so to speak. Brief and to the point, without lyrical digressions.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_303"><text>Ooh, how businesslike we are. Well then, ask your questions.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_304"><text>Do you know who I am?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_305"><text>No.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_306"><text>Do you know where Strelok is?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_307"><text>No.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_308"><text>Tell me about Strelok’s experiments in the Foggy Thicket.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_309"><text>I can only speak about that in the most general terms. Only Strelok himself knew exactly what was being done there and why. He had a fixation — to reach the Monolith and destroy it. And on that “dead Monolith” in the Foggy Thicket, he was planning to test a device to see how the “real” Monolith might react. There were other experiments as well, but all of them, as I understand it, revolved around this same main goal.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_310"><text>How am I connected to these experiments?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_311"><text>You were found in the Foggy Thicket, near the site of one of them. Strelok said it was as if you fell out of nowhere. Stranger things than that happen in the Thicket — you’ve probably noticed by now. Knowing Strelok, I assumed it was hardly a simple coincidence. He probably didn’t even go to the toilet without a reason. For every “sneeze” he always had an explanation, and for every event — his own thoughts. I asked him point-blank: why did you need this stalker? Strelok just shrugged and repeated that everything that had happened was a misunderstanding, a tragic accident. Asked me to take care of that guy — well, that is, of you.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_312"><text>I see... so, in your opinion, why might I have been useful to him?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_313"><text>At first I decided you were meant to play the role of a “key”. You’ve heard the stories, I assume, that the Zone can let you into certain places only through a sacrifice? Think it’s all fairy tales? I’ve actually encountered that.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_314"><text>Nonsense! Then he wouldn’t have cared about my health. What kind of sacrifice is it that they then treat and nurse back to health?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_315"><text>I thought the same, so I soon discarded this version. Then I started looking for another reason and remembered our argument about transferring consciousness. Not that I seriously believed such a thing was possible, but... Those strange devices and installations he either got hold of somewhere or assembled with Fang’s hands... I’m not very strong technically, but here’s what occurred to me: could Strelok, under the guise of one experiment, have carried out a completely different one?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_316"><text>Are you hinting that he transferred or swapped consciousnesses — even if only partially — with me? But why?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_317"><text>Who knows. Strelok, as I’ve already said, was striving with all his might to reach the Monolith. And he almost succeeded — but only almost. Something was in his way. He lacked some final piece of the mosaic. And I don’t rule out that he tried to obtain that missing element from you.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_318"><text>What element? I don’t... Hm. But the Monolithians almost took me for one of their own. As if I have some kind of sign or mark...</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_319"><text>There you go. You’re thinking. It seems to me that this peculiarity of yours will allow you to reach the Monolith itself. Worth trying, don’t you think? Maybe you’ll find Strelok there too, and in general...</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_320"><text>And yet the Doctor warned me that you would try to persuade me to go to the Monolith. You’d sing like a nightingale, just to find out how to get there yourself. I know that you didn’t share Strelok’s views regarding the Monolith, and as for its destruction — that was the last thing you wanted.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_321"><text>I wasn’t going to hide from you that I have a different opinion on this matter. If the Monolith is truly capable of granting wishes, just imagine how much good that could...</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_322"><text>Drop these attempts, Ghost. I don’t believe in your pious intentions and altruism. Be that as it may, I see no other way for myself than to try to repeat Strelok’s path. And that means I have only one road — to the CNPP. And what I’ll do if I reach the Monolith... we’ll see then.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_323"><text>Believe it or not, that suits me just fine. By the way, since you speak so confidently, maybe you already know how you’ll get to the CNPP? I’ve heard there’s no direct route there now.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_324"><text>Uh... Actually no, but it’s alright, I’ll find a way — wouldn’t be the first time.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_325"><text>Let me save you some time. I know that shortly before his disappearance, Strelok visited Pripyat, where he spoke with a certain Lebed the Liaison. This guy runs all the fanatics in the city. I suppose that since they guard the approaches to the station, they must know how to get there most easily and quickly. Something tells me this Lebed won’t refuse to share this information with you.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_326"><text>Sounds reasonable. Pripyat, then Pripyat. Yes, one last question. Why did you badmouth Ivar and try to turn me against the Doctor? Part of what you said during our last meeting was an outright lie, while another part was confirmed.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_327"><text>I wanted to see how you’d react. I told you I had several theories about you and wasn’t completely sure who I was dealing with. Consider it just a test.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_328"><text>Uh-huh. I’ll pretend I believed you. Alright, it’s time for me to get ready for the road. I wouldn’t advise you to trail after me. I’m not a “key”, whatever you may think. I sincerely hope we won’t meet again.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_329"><text>Who knows how it will all turn out. It may yet happen that you yourself will come looking for a meeting with me.\nAh, yes, one more thing. If you remember, I told you that I managed to make copies of files from Strelok’s flash drive, which he forgot in one of our hideouts. So, among other things, there was a map with marked locations of stash placements at the CNPP. Who made them and when, I don’t know, but they may come in very handy for you.\nThat’s it, I wish you good luck! I hope you have enough strength to go this path to the end.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_start_dialog_401"><text>Putting off the inevitable?</text></string>

<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_0"><text>I wanted to tell you about Fang. I thought you might find it interesting. You’ve been in harness with him for a long time, right?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_1"><text>Well, basically yes. Sakharov has already had time to complain to me that you lost some device that was issued to you to get Fang to the surface and deliver him to the scientists. But I still didn’t fully understand: did you help Fang or not?</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_2"><text>I helped. But not in the way the professor would have liked. I sent him to the Foggy Thicket, to the Doctor.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_3"><text>What? So he’s still here, in the Zone?!</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_4"><text>Well, yes. He’s lying low in a cave. He picked it out for his needs a long time ago and knows it like the back of his hand. So he’s quite comfortable there... if that word is appropriate in his circumstances. I think sooner or later the Doctor will find a way to cure him. Or he and Ivar will figure something out together.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_5"><text>Yeah... That’s some help, alright. The scientists offered you a real option to save him. Fang could have been taken beyond the perimeter and handled by real specialists. And here what chances does he have? Some kind uncle brings a miracle artifact and everything goes back to normal? Ah well... What’s done is done.</text></string>
<string id="prizrak_about_klyk_dlg_6"><text>I know those specialists — I’ve seen enough of them already. Successors of Doctor Mengele. And what did you yourself do for Fang? You knew for sure from the Doctor that he was at Agroprom. Did you go to Sakharov for advice or come up with something useful? Did you even drop by once to see how he was doing, to cheer him up a bit? Pfah... You’d better keep quiet than criticize others.</text></string>

<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_0"><text>Ivar, I’ve got business with you. Do you remember you let slip that I remind you of someone?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_1"><text>Did I say that? No. I don’t remember...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_2"><text>I met with Ghost. And he claims that you know me. More than that — that it was you who brought me to Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_3"><text>What?! No! I don’t know what games Ghost is playing or why he’s slandering me, but...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_4"><text>What “but”? Finish your thought. You did recognize me, didn’t you? I was one of your patients? Beyond the perimeter? Or already here, in the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_5"><text>Calm down, friend. Yes, you really did remind me of someone, but now, when things in my head have cleared up a bit, I’m increasingly doubting that it could have been you.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_6"><text>That won’t do. Tell it in order.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_7"><text>All right. Once I arranged to meet Strelok in the Red Forest. He wanted to clarify something regarding the materials I had passed on to him concerning the effects of the “Black Mark” on the bearer’s body. I, as you can imagine, also had questions for him. When I arrived at the meeting place, to my surprise it turned out that Strelok hadn’t come alone. Ghost was with him, and another unfamiliar stalker. All three of them were sitting by the campfire, and when Strelok noticed me, he stood up to meet me and immediately led me aside. Apparently, he didn’t want the others to overhear our conversation.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_8"><text>That third stalker — that was me, right?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_9"><text>Dusk was already falling, so I couldn’t really make him out properly. He was sitting half-turned away from me, his head lowered. On top of that, part of his face was hidden by the hood of his suit.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_10"><text>And still?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_11"><text>I already told you: I think it wasn’t you. There was some resemblance, but nothing more. From that angle and in that lighting, anyone could have been mistaken for someone else.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_12"><text>Then why, in that conversation of ours, did you exclaim something like “you can’t be him”? By your own words now, it turns out there was no reason for such categorical statements.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_13"><text>All right... I’ll tell you. That man... he looked extremely exhausted. And in general it seemed to me that he behaved overly listlessly, like a somnambulist. These and some other details of his appearance indicated that he’d had the bad luck to “catch” the notorious “Black Mark”. I think Strelok wanted to conduct some kind of experiment on him...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_14"><text>Why did you decide that?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_15"><text>When I was approaching the campfire, Strelok was animatedly arguing with Ghost about the psychomatrix and either the transfer of consciousness or the overlaying of one consciousness onto another. Only fragments of phrases reached me, but the general sense of the conversation, as I understood it, boiled down to Strelok trying to convince Ghost to test some theory of his in practice. At the same time, either one or the other would alternately point a finger or nod in the direction of the third stalker, and he didn’t react at all, as if none of it concerned him.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_16"><text>Well I’ll be damned! And what kind of theory did Strelok have? You didn’t ask him about it?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_17"><text>I asked in passing, but he just waved it off. Said he’d tell me sometime later, that he didn’t have time right now. And indeed, after talking about urgent matters, they immediately started getting ready to move out. And I headed back to our camp. I remember hearing, just before I left, how Ghost asked Strelok: “Are you sure this can only be done in the Thicket?” After that meeting I saw Strelok one more time, but I’ve already told you about that. Then I was completely consumed by the idea that the increase in strange mental disorders beyond the perimeter was connected with the operation of the “Brain Scorcher”, and I didn’t try to learn more about Strelok’s experiments.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_18"><text>I see. And you decided that that... “test subject” was most likely already a goner anyway, having caught the “Black Mark”, and after Strelok’s experiments — all the more so. And here I am, seemingly alive and kicking, standing in front of you, pestering you with questions. Which means I can’t be that man. There’s logic in that. But what if Strelok actually did manage to somehow swap consciousness with that stalker? Fully or partially. And the “mark” jumped to him. You yourself told me how he strove to obtain it in order to become “one of his own” for the Monolith...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_19"><text>Yeah... if Ghost’s goal was to confuse you, then he definitely succeeded. You’ve got quite the imagination, Marked One. That’s quite a twist you’ve put on my words...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_20"><text>Wait! Let me finish the thought. It turns out that if you really didn’t mistake me, and it truly was me you saw back then, and then Strelok did something to me because of which I lost my memory... Am I just the result of his failed experiment? Or was it a success after all?! He got what he was aiming for, do you think?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_21"><text>Your suspiciousness will get you killed one day, Marked One. For the tenth time I repeat: I think it was another person. And Ghost is deliberately trying to generate as much white noise as possible, feeding you far-fetched versions. I can’t for the life of me understand why he’s doing this.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_22"><text>Yeah, yeah, sure. And here I was racking my brain over where these strange “memories” came from and why I doubt that they’re mine... Turns out it could easily be that none of it is mine at all. And how am I even supposed to understand now whose is whose in my head? Maybe I’m just going crazy, huh, Ivar?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_23"><text>Pull yourself together at last! As a specialist, I assure you: you show no signs of insanity whatsoever.\nYes, the Doctor correctly noted that you’re highly suggestible. Under no circumstances should you be pushed toward any particular idea — you must arrive at everything yourself...</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_24"><text>The Doctor talked to you about me?! You discussed my... what do you doctors call it... case? And what did the council of learned men decide in my regard?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_25"><text>I don’t understand your sarcasm. The Doctor is genuinely very worried about you. He asked for advice.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_26"><text>And what advice did you give him?</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_27"><text>Basically, I only confirmed the correctness of the strategy initially chosen. You needed to be shielded from direct suggestion, only given a general direction, attempts made to bring you together with old acquaintances, to persuade you to visit places you’d been to before, in order to subtly push your consciousness toward searching for your inner “I”.</text></string>
<string id="ivar_after_prizrak_dialog_28"><text>Well, thanks. You pushed it so well it nearly smashed its face when it fell.\nAll right, I’ll go talk to the Doctor now. It’s time to decide something already...</text></string>

<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_0"><text>Doctor, I need to have a serious talk with you. I met with Ghost.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_1"><text>Is that so? I was racking my brain over how to let Ghost know that he should finally reach out to you. And it turns out you managed to talk without my “matchmaking” after all. Very good.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_2"><text>What’s so good about it? He told me such things... For example, that it was Ivar who brought me to Strelok. That I had supposedly been his patient back there, beyond the perimeter. That I drank without drying out until one day I snapped and killed my family. Then I ended up in a madhouse and escaped from there into the Zone. He also said that you know a lot about me, but are keeping quiet.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_3"><text>What nonsense?! Of course, I don’t know your past, but I’m certain he clearly made up that biography. I’ve seen many people in my lifetime, and believe me, you don’t look like a drunkard wastrel, nor a deranged psycho, let alone a murderer.\nAs for Strelok... As far as I know, Strelok merely consulted Ivar on some questions from his field of expertise. Something about the connection between mental disorders and the artifact known as the “Black Mark”. Ivar is a doctor. He would never put his patient in danger by agreeing to...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_4"><text>Why did you stop? By agreeing to what? To Strelok’s experiment? Yes, yes, I already know about that too. Before coming to you, I talked to Ivar. He told me about a strange stalker he saw in the company of Strelok and Ghost. It seems the poor guy had the bad luck to get hit with the “Black Mark”, and Strelok was planning to conduct some kind of experiment on him. When I met Ivar in the Bar after the trip to the “Brain Scorcher”, he seemed to recognize that unfortunate stalker in me, but later backed out, saying he must have been mistaken.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_5"><text>I see you’ve indeed found out quite a lot, only you’re drawing the wrong conclusions. It seems Ghost deliberately decided to confuse you. But for what purpose, I’d really like to know?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_6"><text>Don’t steer the conversation aside. What do you know about Strelok’s experiment and my — or perhaps not my — role in it?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_7"><text>All right. I suppose there really is no point in continuing to hide this now. I don’t know exactly what experiments Strelok was conducting or what exactly he was trying to achieve. I do know there were several of them, and they all took place in the Foggy Thicket, near the ravine at the bottom of which stands the “dead Monolith”. It’s a huge crystal around which all instruments that measure the intensity of the psi-field go off the scale. Some believe that it is a fragment of that very legendary Monolith...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_8"><text>To hell with the Monolith! Get to the point.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_9"><text>Don’t get so worked up, Marked One. I’m getting to the essence. One day the whole trio showed up at my hut: Fang, Ghost, and Strelok. I knew that the day before they had once again been fiddling with some equipment near the “dead Monolith”, so their appearance didn’t surprise me. What did surprise me was that they were carrying another person on improvised stretchers. He was unconscious. And that was you, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_10"><text>So it’s true after all... And what happened next?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_11"><text>According to Strelok, shortly after completing the tests of some installation assembled by Fang according to his design, they found a stalker unconscious within its area of effect, showing signs of psi-radiation damage. Apparently, it was an absurd accident. You were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_12"><text>Or very much the opposite — in exactly the right place, at exactly the right time. So what about the transfer or overlaying of consciousness, huh, Doc?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_13"><text>What did you say? Transfer of consciousness? Are you serious? Is that even possible? Did Ghost spin that tale for you too?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_14"><text>No, Ivar. He managed to partially overhear an argument between Strelok and Ghost. That’s exactly what it was about. True, Ivar was far away and didn’t catch everything... And why did I even assume that Strelok was going to experiment on that stalker? Just because Ivar saw that pair nodding in his direction?!</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_15"><text>There you go. You’re already starting to doubt yourself. A vivid confirmation of how easily you succumb to manipulation and suggestion. Now imagine how you would have reacted if I had immediately told you everything I knew. Would you have believed me?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_16"><text>The question is different: should I believe what you’re saying now? It seems I’m completely tangled up... All right, I’ll listen to your version to the end. What happened after they brought me to your hut?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_17"><text>Strelok almost immediately said his goodbyes and went off on his own business, instructing Ghost to take care of you. It seems he felt guilty about the misfortune that had befallen you. I gave you first aid and asked Ghost and Fang to carry you to a safer place, where you lay recovering for quite a long time. By the way, you were there later, after your recovery. It’s the group’s secret hideout in the underground tunnels of Agroprom. From my observations, recovery after a strong psi-strike proceeds the faster the closer the victim is to the borders of the Zone, but in your case, for some reason, everything went rather slowly, so we took turns watching over you: me, Fang, and Ghost.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_18"><text>So that’s why I had the feeling I’d already been there before... And I knew how to get into the hideout itself. But no details stuck in my head. Wait! But I was found by Ginger near that truck on the Cordon... How?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_19"><text>Honestly? I don’t know. That day I was sitting with you, but after receiving an urgent request for help from an acquaintance, I was forced to leave my watch for a short while. I don’t know what made you get up and make your way out of the underground tunnels... There was a powerful emission then, one of the strongest I can remember. Maybe it affected you somehow, or you simply came to for a time and went on “autopilot” in a familiar direction, or something else... Be that as it may, when I returned, you were already gone without a trace. The next day I was informed that you had been found on the Cordon, and I went there. Thus was born the legend of the lone survivor from the “death truck”. In the village, when you gradually started coming to your senses, we properly met for the first time. The rest you already know.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_20"><text>Well, your version sounds fairly plausible, but don’t take it amiss, I’m no longer going to take anything on faith. It seems I have no other choice but to keep heading north. I hope there I’ll finally understand why Strelok was so drawn there, and perhaps even find him himself.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_21"><text>You’re talking about the Monolith? But...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_22"><text>Yes, I know, I know. Strelok most likely wanted to destroy it. Everything points to that. But either he failed, or... his goal was different after all.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_23"><text>I can’t vouch for Strelok, but Ghost definitely held a different point of view — that the Monolith must not be destroyed under any circumstances. They argued about this more than once. I think Ghost secretly dreams of putting the Monolith to work for himself, and therefore gathers any information about it that he can. Perhaps he wouldn’t mind persuading you to go to the Monolith, in order to observe from the sidelines what would come of it.\nIn any case, whatever you’re planning, I wish you luck, Marked One! This will be your most dangerous foray into the Zone — prepare yourself thoroughly and finish all your business. Who knows what awaits you there. It’s not worth dragging along the burden of unfulfilled promises and unsolved mysteries.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_241"><text>The main mystery for me is who I really am. It’s time to grab Ghost firmly by the throat. Farewell.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_after_prizrak_dialog_242"><text>The main mystery for me is who I really am. It’s time to grab Ghost firmly by the throat. And I’d like to see Fang one last time as well — then I’m off. Farewell.</text></string>

<string id="final_common_dialog_0"><text>Doctor? What’s happening? How did I end up in the Foggy Thicket?</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_1"><text>I thought you’d tell me what you were doing here. There was a bright flash on the other side of the hill. I went to check it out and found you near the “dead Monolith”.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_2"><text>But how did I get there? So does that mean it transported me?!</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_3"><text>I don’t understand you at all, Marked One. Who transported you? You were heading on a raid to the north, weren’t you?</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_4"><text>Yes... And I managed to repeat Strelok’s path by visiting the CNPP. There I found his notes and thought I could reach the Monolith using them. In the end, I found myself in some underground complex, but all the passages there were completely sealed. Then I noticed a teleport bubble, stepped into it, and ended up here...</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_5"><text>Incredible! You came closer to the secret of the Monolith than anyone else! If we don’t count Strelok himself, of course.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_6"><text>It seems to me that Strelok also failed to unravel it. Something didn’t let him through. Just like me, as it happens... But I understood everything. Or almost everything. True... it no longer matters.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_7"><text>Are you still angry with me? Don’t you want to share what was revealed to you there?</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_8"><text>No, I’m no longer angry. You did the right thing. If you had told me everything you knew about me right away, I probably wouldn’t have dared to follow Strelok’s trail to the end — I wouldn’t have had the nerve. And so I would still be stuck in confusion, doubt, and self-examination. But now... what’s happened has happened. Nothing can be fixed anyway, nothing can be changed. Strelok understood this too, I think. And he left. Completely.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_9"><text>Are you sure? How do you know?</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_10"><text>I told you, I found his notes. His last notes, I think. I don’t know where he came from or where he is now, but here, in the Zone, he definitely isn’t. If he was from the future, he could have returned back, to his own time. Or to some other one. He came to terms with the fact that it’s impossible to change the past, no matter how hard you try, no matter what technologies you possess. You can’t change cause and effect. All his attempts were doomed from the start, and now we all have to live with this Zone and with this Monolith one way or another. And as for me... I have a feeling that my last trip wasn’t in vain.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_11"><text>What do you mean?</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_12"><text>I remembered myself. Now I know for sure: I am not him. I am not Strelok, and there is not a single one of his memories, or an imprint of his consciousness, or anything of the sort in me. But Ghost, it seems to me, is still convinced of that.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_13"><text>I’m very happy for you. It’s wonderful that you finally found yourself, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_14"><text>Yes... And although my memory hasn’t fully returned to me yet, something has been remembered, something is only just beginning to emerge, as if from the fog, but that’s not the main thing. The point is that now I clearly know: everything that’s in my head is mine and no one else’s. All my mistakes are mine, all my failures are mine, and all the consequences of the decisions I’ve made... In short, you probably can’t imagine what it’s like to feel like a whole and free individual, rather than a puppet in someone else’s hands or a spineless appendage to some unknown... entities.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_15"><text>Tell me about yourself, then. I think you need to speak your mind.</text></string>
<string id="final_common_dialog_16"><text>Yes... Wait a little.</text></string>

<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_0"><text>Sanek, do you happen to have any special artifacts?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_1"><text>Special — like what, for example? Are Dummies no longer special for you? </text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_2"><text>Not Dummies. Or maybe they are Dummies, who knows... Anyway, what I need is specifically this: </text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_3"><text>Hmm... You’re a gourmet. Collecting? Or did someone ask you to find them?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_4"><text>Doesn’t matter. It’s for a job, I really need it.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_5"><text>I’m afraid a collection like that will cost you a pretty penny... or rather, artifacts. Maybe I can find such things, but you understand — it’s a custom order, not a simple one.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_6"><text>Alright, down to business. How much and when?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_7"><text>If we’re being brief, my business-minded friend, then in just a couple of hours some guy promised to bring something like that. You might get lucky and it’ll be just what’s in your collection. But it’ll cost you each one for a... Dummy.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_8"><text>Sanek — are you serious?!</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_9"><text>I warned you I’d charge a lot. Rarity...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art1_dialog_10"><text>I’ll come back later, if you don’t run off. If not, I’ll find you later. Maybe we can haggle at least for one.</text></string>

<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_0"><text>So, what about the order?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_1"><text>Too early. Come back a bit later.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_11"><text>Alright. Later it is.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_2"><text>You’re lucky, Marked One, like a drowned man... I’ve got exactly the artifacts you asked for. Will you take them all at once, or one at a time?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_21"><text>It’s a shame to spend Dummies on this. I’ll think about it some more...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_3"><text>I’ve got Dummies. Let’s take a look.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_4"><text>Choose: </text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_5"><text>I’ll take only the first one. Here’s the Dummy.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_6"><text>I’ll take only the second one. Here’s the Dummy.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_7"><text>I’ll take only the third one. Here’s the Dummy.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_8"><text>A successful deal. If you need others — come by.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_quest_art2_dialog_9"><text>We’ll see.</text></string>

<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_0"><text>Sanek, help me out. I urgently need one specific artifact — “Mama’s Beads”.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_1"><text>Urgently, huh? I don’t have one myself... But I know who can get it. If we agree on the price, it’ll be delivered from the Army Warehouses in about three hours.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_2"><text>Excellent. What do you want for it?</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_3"><text>You see, lately the route to the Army Warehouses, where I also do business, has become downright unsafe. Folks say bloodsuckers even lie in wait along the road. And how’s a loner supposed to fend them off? Right — grenades. And best of all underbarrel ones, to stir things up from a distance. The problem is, I’ve got neither an underbarrel launcher nor grenades. Get me a GP-25 and about 20 VOGs for it — and we’ve got a deal. If not, then no deal.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_41"><text>I expected you’d jack up the price, but this... Alright, I don’t have much choice. I’ll get you the underbarrel and the VOGs, but make sure the Beads are already here in no more than three hours. And don’t you dare run off somewhere yourself.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_42"><text>Are you out of your mind? I’ll do without your “tempting” deal.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_start_dlg_5"><text>Good. I’ll send you a message when it’s time to come pick up the order, if you don’t show up yourself by the appointed time.</text></string>

<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_done_dlg_0"><text>I’m here for the “Beads”.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_done_dlg_1"><text>Yeah, here they are, waiting. Show me the underbarrel. It’s decent, right? Not rusted through?</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_done_dlg_21"><text>It’s fine, it’s fine. Take the grenades too. You can check it yourself later.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_done_dlg_22"><text>So... Where did I put it? Stay here, I’ll be right back.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_done_dlg_3"><text>I’ll check, as is customary. If I took everyone at their word, I’d have gone under in this business long ago. Alright, here’s the artifact. Deal’s done.</text></string>
<string id="art_exch_glassbeads_done_dlg_4"><text>Take care.</text></string>

<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_0"><text>Voron, do you happen to have any special artifacts?</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_1"><text>Special — like what, for example? And what do I have to do with it?</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_2"><text>Well, people bring you all sorts of collectible items. Maybe rare artifacts too... Anyway, I need something very specific like this: </text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_3"><text>Hm... You’re a gourmet. Collecting yourself? Or did someone ask you to find them?</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_4"><text>Doesn’t matter. They’ll come in handy for a certain job.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_5"><text>I’m afraid such a collectible rarity will cost you a pretty penny... or rather, coupons. I might be able to find them, but you understand — it’s a custom order, not an easy one...</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_6"><text>Alright, down to business. How much and when?</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_7"><text>If we keep it short, my business-minded friend, then literally in a couple of hours one guy promised to bring something like that. Maybe you’ll get lucky and it’ll be exactly what you need for your collection. But each one will cost you... a thousand greens. That is, total: three grand US.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_8"><text>You’re such a... bloodsucker.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_9"><text>It’s not us... it’s life. I warned you it’d be expensive.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art1_dialog_10"><text>Alright. I’ll come back later, maybe we’ll haggle at least for one. Or maybe Sanyok the trader will have something like that.</text></string>

<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_0"><text>So, what about the order?</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_1"><text>You came too early. Come back a bit later.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_11"><text>Alright. Later it is.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_2"><text>You’re lucky, Marked One, like a drowned man... I’ve got exactly the artifacts you need. You got the money?</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_21"><text>Pity to spend coupons on this. I’ll think about it some more...</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_3"><text>Of course! Let’s take a look at what you’ve got.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_4"><text>Choose: </text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_5"><text>I’ll take the first one. Here’s the coupon.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_6"><text>I’ll take the second one. Here’s the coupon.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_7"><text>I’ll take the third one. Here’s the coupon.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_8"><text>Good deal. If you need others — come by.</text></string>
<string id="voron_quest_art2_dialog_9"><text>We’ll see.</text></string>

<string id="strelok_book_news_0"><text>...there will arise a need for the maximum possible number of such formations; however, the scarcity of reliable information does not allow for a thorough study, and we resemble medieval alchemists in search of the philosopher’s stone... \n 
...One of our analysts has put forward a rather interesting hypothesis. In short, its essence is as follows: the Object, as we know from indirect data and the attempts of our researchers, is shielded by a nonlinear distortion field of the space-time continuum. The opposite polarity and the extremely complex generated ionic flow are akin to that observed in so-called "teleports". There are a number of discrepancies here, but its function is analogous to directed displacement, albeit with elements of tolerance... \n 
...Put more simply, it can be taken as a basis that this is a teleport in the sense already familiar to us, but with a certain activation key. Moreover, this is not a primitive rebalance of a field disturbed by the presence of organic matter, nor is it an anomaly triggered by the presence of a specific direct influence of some physical component. This is precisely a selection, or rather an "assembly", of quite specific anomalous formations. At one time, such formations were mistakenly called artifacts, but by now it is clear to everyone that they are not a product of purposeful human activity... \n 
...Thus, we have information about certain "assemblies". It indirectly confirms our attempts to crack the ionic coding of the Object in the presence of parametric foundations according to the Fateev–Bazhov hypothesis.\n 
...As a result, we can say that the risk is justified. The intermediate stability of a logically unfolded chain of atomic masses has already been confirmed as a variant of docking dispersion of elements for the creation of a directed generated ionic flow with refraction at the hysteresis point. And this is the good news. The bad news is that we will have to switch to autonomous field tests.\n
...Continue working with samples No. 2, 6, 8, 9, 11... and connect a couple more with low weight in accordance with the atomic-molecular scale... \n
...It already resembles a breakthrough; it is now possible to compile a numbered table and describe the sequences for assembling elementary chains. The mathematical analysis conducted by the logistics group identified four closest chains with a number of elements ranging from two to five. Variant No. 1. With a high degree of probability, it is based on five elements; we will test it first. No less interesting is variant No. 2 — four elements. This is the priority for the upcoming sessions. Variant No. 3 of three elements is, in principle, also possible. If, however, you manage to create a chain of only two elements, then honor and praise to you! \n
... \n
Thus. 1. The required anomalous formations are needed. 2. Their required combination is needed. 3. Total weight 15 kg +/- 100 g. 4. A point of entry into the required teleport is needed... That is sufficient!
</text></string>

<string id="strelok_book_news_1"><text>Damn, damn and damn!!! Everything is pointless again. Everything is there, the right teleport has been found, but it won’t let me through! So close. The solution was almost found, all that remained was to find the path. And now it exists. And what? I can’t pass... I’m tired. So much time, so much effort, and all for nothing... \n \n
And so many victims... \n \n
What other victims? It is I who sacrificed my entire comfortable life, and I sacrificed my health, everything, all for this. I am the real victim. But I am ready for more. If only... After all, they were right — the “Black Mark” is the main key, and the assembly is only an addition. Or the second option — a Monolith-type consciousness implant. Neither is available to me. I would gladly sacrifice myself, but I am not allowed to. \n \n
Then why didn’t you tell Ghost about the “Mark”? He would have gotten infected for such an occasion... \n \n
You understand nothing. He immediately caught fire with that idea, I saw it myself. And it was obvious that he would use this opportunity for himself, to benefit personally. His goals were clear from the very beginning. But I needed him. Only he could believe me. And I needed him as a connoisseur of the Zone, and for searching artifacts. A real psycho... \n \n
Who are you talking about now? About him or... \n \n
About him, of course. Only a madman could come up with something like that. Ghost imagined himself the arbiter of human destinies, wanted to become a new Messiah who would come to people in the past and turn the entire course of history upside down, relying on knowledge of the future... To make himself a living god, to create a cult of himself. That could not be allowed. \n \n
Listen to the way you talk... And what about yourself? \n \n
No! Everything is not like that!.. But how conveniently and timely that guy fell into the Foggy Thicket. I had no idea where he came from. And I deliberately invented that story about a possible overlap of consciousness in order to finally get rid of Ghost. He only became an obstacle and would not leave my side for a single step — but what could he have done next? He would have ruined my entire plan with his delusional ideas... And this way — he swallowed the hook, decided that he could pull something out of that guy, something “mine” from his consciousness. And I was finally able to disappear... \n \n
Yeah... a good hook. Once again you set someone up. And you didn’t care what would happen to him, or what Ghost might do while pulling “your” information out of him... \n \n
You’re lying! I didn’t set anyone up. Just... a little false data. For the cause. \n \n
Of course, for the cause. And what about those stalkers you fed lies to? Also “a little false data for the cause”? Remember how you sent them to turn on the installation. They were na?ve... \n \n
It wasn’t like that!!! \n \n
...they bought it. And of course no one came out of there. Or maybe they are still wandering there, mooing, pressing their foreheads against the walls? How about your conscience — doesn’t it torment you? \n \n
What do you know about conscience? The existence of humanity is at stake! And I bear responsibility for all mankind. That is my conscience. \n \n
Right. And the ends, of course, justify the means... Remember Fang. You didn’t tell him everything when you sent him, did you? \n \n
I told him everything he needed to know. And he did everything. What happened was an accident, a coincidence of circumstances. \n \n
Uh-huh... Of course. That’s exactly what you told the Doctor. By the way, about the Doctor. Wasn’t it you who hinted to someone that he knew too much? \n \n
What are you talking about?! We were talking... about something else. \n \n
And Ivar? You didn’t know that he might not make it out? \n \n
He wanted it himself. I certainly didn’t send Ivar anywhere. Don’t pin Ivar on me as well. He knew what he was getting into. \n \n
Exactly. He figured out right away that he might not make it out and laid low, but sent others instead. And now they are also on your conscience. As well as Ivar himself. And everyone else, all for the sake of a “great” goal. \n \n
No! Do not attribute to me what I did not do! You know nothing about my goal! \n \n
I know as much as you do. Your “great” goal would not have existed if you yourself had not become the reason it became necessary. So, my friend, face reality — if you still can. If you decided to take responsibility for humanity, then you and only you are responsible for everything: for all those victims, for all the chaos that will happen there and later. All of this is the result of your actions here and now. \n \n
Shut up! Everything is not like that. It cannot be like that... \n \n
So truthful? The truth is sometimes cruel... The path to truth is not always pleasant. \n \n
Shut up already!!! \n \n
Or what? Will you kill me? Hm... try it. Just another small victim for the sake of a “great goal”. You’re used to it. \n \n
SHUT UP!!! \n \n

<string id="rad_mil_cook_start_dialog_102"><text>I’ll have time for that. Why aren’t you going there yourself?</text></string>
<string id="rad_mil_cook_start_dialog_103"><text>I’m waiting for my buddies. They’ll soon be dragging bags of loot from the north. Although, they’re taking a long time. Maybe they got stuck there, or can’t haul such a heavy load.</text></string>
<string id="rad_mil_cook_start_dialog_104"><text>That’s the thing — the load there is a strange one. You might not end up waiting for them.</text></string>
<string id="rad_mil_cook_start_dialog_201"><text>Still hanging around here? Without you, all the loot in the north will be scooped up. Watch it, you might miss out.</text></string>
<string id="rad_mil_cook_start_dialog_202"><text>Don’t worry, I won’t miss what’s mine.</text></string>

<string id="semena_task_description"><text>For the Monolithians to point the way to the "Monolith", you need to plant the "shoots" at the points of energy release. Namely: throw special artifacts into the "Matrix" anomaly on the Radar, in the Raycenter, and in the "Tesla" zone. Don’t lose them — they won’t give you any more.</text></string>

<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_0"><text>I have received your call.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_1"><text>You have done a great deed, fulfilled what was destined.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_2"><text>How do you know what I’ve done? I haven’t reported anything yet.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_3"><text>There is a connection, I feel His breath. People speak much and do little. You are one of them. But you acted.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_4"><text>Well... here we go again. Let’s keep it simple. That “breath” isn’t as important to me as it is to you, and I don’t really need “His” attention either. Those are your problems. I only need to know how to go further, to the station. That’s all.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_5"><text>The paths are always open, but not everyone is allowed to pass. There is a path nearby, beyond the field.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_6"><text>What do you mean?! So I could have passed anyway — without your seeds? Even from here somewhere, from Pripyat? Just like that?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_7"><text>His breath will not allow you to overcome it. It is not simple. A human is weak, he will not pass there. And it will not let anyone near without a gift. You made the gift. You will be accepted, but not there.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_8"><text>No need to accept me anywhere... So I won’t make it beyond the field. Then where can I pass? Is there another way?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_9"><text>You call it the "Tesla" zone. A labyrinth. Pass through it and you will be where you strive to go.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_10"><text>I’ve heard something about the “Labyrinth”... That’s where that bubble is, right? But “Tesla” is a place too — not for the weak either. It fries you with electricity.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_101"><text>Not now. There will be three days of calm. You will be able to pass.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_102"><text>Three days? Hm... Well, if I manage to get ready, I’ll try to pass. That area has been drawing me for a long time, but I never managed to explore it properly.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_11"><text>Go to Him. And you will know.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_12"><text>What’s it to you anyway? Even if I go, so what? I don’t understand your interest in me.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_13"><text>You were marked. It is His interest. Not mine. Humans cannot understand. Each unit of consciousness marked by Him is important to Him.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_14"><text>I’m afraid that with “Him” there I might end up with zero consciousness altogether... And there will be no “unit” of yours. I need to weigh everything and prepare. I feel there may be no way back.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_leader_semena_done_dialog_15"><text>You are on the right path. You strive for truth. Do not lose sight of it. Do not turn away. I will show a short path.</text></string>

<string id="docent_scarman_start_dialog_0"><text>I’ve got a special PDA, want to take a look?</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_start_dialog_1"><text>Where do you even find these? Show it.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_start_dialog_2"><text>Look, seems like something is encrypted.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_start_dialog_3"><text>Let me see... doesn’t really look like proper encryption. I have a feeling it’s more like an imitation of real ciphering, because I don’t see any special software here, and it’s too... “out in the open”, so to speak. Someone made a simple foolproof protection. Meaning, in theory, it’s some kind of combination of symbols, the key to which the owner knew. Logically, the key itself should be simple. Anyway, I think it’s not hard, but I really don’t have time right now — I’m swamped.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_start_dialog_4"><text>If it’s all so simple, why bother complicating things at all?</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_start_dialog_5"><text>Maybe it points to some place, or a name, which the owner stored this way so he could remember it himself if needed, but others wouldn’t understand it at a casual glance... Leave it here, I’ll run it through one tricky program now and we’ll see what comes out. Meanwhile, think about how to gild Docent’s pen. A second-tier artifact will be enough. Just make sure it’s not stale. I need a fresh one to test an idea.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_start_dialog_6"><text>Work your magic, you’ll get your artifact.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_start_dialog_7"><text>Won’t take long, take a walk for about thirty minutes.</text></string>

<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_0"><text>How about that PDA with the cipher?</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_1"><text>And where is the payment for my intellectual labor?</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_21"><text>Oh, you miser. Of course I brought it — where would I go.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_22"><text>You said it was simple. But you charged like it was the secret of the “Monolith”.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_31"><text>Come on, I don’t think you’ll be at a loss.\nWrite this down: "Stash in the Red Forest — backpack in the old mine, in the large hall".</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_32"><text>Come on, I don’t think you’ll be at a loss.\nWrite this down: "Stash in the Red Forest — backpack in the valley, by the rocks, near the cave entrance".</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_33"><text>Come on, I don’t think you’ll be at a loss.\nWrite this down: "Stash in the Red Forest — backpack in the valley, under a tree, next to a strange crater".</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_4"><text>That’s it? No more information?</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_5"><text>What else did you want? A list of items in the stash, or the revelation of all the Zone’s secrets?</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_61"><text>Maybe something more specific. Though... oh well. You say Red Forest and a mine... I think I know where that is.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_62"><text>Maybe something more specific. Though... oh well. You say Red Forest and a cave... I think I know where that is.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_63"><text>Maybe something more specific. Though... oh well. You say Red Forest and a crater... I think I know where that is.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_7"><text>Don’t forget about poor Docent if the stash is rich. And I’ll keep the PDA, if you don’t mind. There’s nothing useful left in it anyway. Drinks are on me.</text></string>
<string id="docent_scarman_done_dialog_8"><text>You’ve already got your share, don’t get greedy. I can drink to your health at most.</text></string>

<string id="greens_voda_dialog_1"><text>We don’t have any spare water right now. We’re conserving it ourselves. We need water to wash entrails, it’s required for production. And anyway...</text></string>
<string id="greens_voda_dialog_2"><text>Alright, I’ll fill up at the Cordon.</text></string>
<string id="greens_voda_dialog_11"><text>We’re conserving it ourselves... But you did us such a favor with curing the hides. Fine, go ahead and fill up at the washbasin. Free of charge, for now.</text></string>
<string id="greens_voda_dialog_22"><text>Well, at least something’s free.</text></string>

<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_0"><text>So what about that stalker who was lying in your barracks?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_1"><text>The one who was mumbling about Krivoy? Or whatever his name was...</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_2"><text>Ryaboy.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_3"><text>Right, that’s it. Well, it’s all over now. You could tell he wouldn’t last long. Did you meet that Ryaboy?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_4"><text>Well, not exactly met him. He perished too. As Diodor says, we pay for our sins — a sad but expected end for people like him.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_5"><text>That’s still unclear whose sin was greater there. Our wounded man turned out to be quite a piece of work too.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_6"><text>Meaning?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_71"><text>Right before he died, Diodor happened to be here and went in to see him. So the man asked him for confession. Well, he dictated it to him — or rather whispered it, as best he could. A bit disjointed, but the picture is clear.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_72"><text>One stalker asked us for a place to stay the night. And it turned out we put him in the same barracks as the wounded man — there was no space elsewhere. So, get this, that stalker recognized him. The nameless one passed away a couple of hours later, and in the morning the man told our guys a curious story.\nHe said that a few days ago he crawled into an adit in the Red Forest to wait out a downpour. After some time he hears someone coming. He kept quiet and started watching. Sees two guys. They sit down to drink, talking quietly. Then one of them suddenly opens fire and unloads a burst into the other. After that the killer rummages through the dead man’s backpack and drags the body toward the nearest carousel. Looks like he planned to get rid of the corpse, but apparently he drank too much vodka, misjudged things a bit, and flew into the anomaly himself. The storyteller waited for a while and then decided to get closer. The killer was alive, though badly mangled. While he was scratching his head over what to do next, he heard the heavy footsteps of a giant approaching. Naturally, he bolted from there at full speed, no fool. But he says he got a good look at the killer and remembered him. And in the barracks he recognized him in the nameless wounded man. That’s how it was!</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_81"><text>How do you know?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_82"><text>Well, damn! And are you sure that “witness” didn’t make it all up himself? Or didn’t mix him up with someone else? What was his name, by the way?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_91"><text>Diodor wrote that confession down right there, on the body. You were looking for Ryaboy — here you go, read it. You can keep it, there’s no point passing it on to Ryaboy now, and I don’t need it, our guys have all read it anyway.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_92"><text>Am I sure? No, of course not. I don’t know him personally at all. But why would he make up such a story? And our guys just called him by his name — Tokha.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_101"><text>I’ll read it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dying_end_dialog_102"><text>Huh... There are plenty of Tokhas in the Zone! Ryaboy is dead, and it looks like I won’t be finding the last person who saw him alive. And what would that even give me? It’s unlikely they knew each other. Another dead end. Damn...</text></string>

<!-- Äîáàâëåíî â 2017 -->
<string id="bar_tonnel_dialog_0"><text>So where did Ivar go?</text></string>
<string id="bar_tonnel_dialog_1"><text>What am I, your Ivar’s babysitter?</text></string>
<string id="bar_tonnel_dialog_2"><text>Well, you never know. He didn’t drop by here?</text></string>
<string id="bar_tonnel_dialog_3"><text>He did, bought a few things and left. I didn’t pry into his plans. These days everyone’s heading north, so he probably went there too.</text></string>
<string id="bar_tonnel_dialog_4"><text>I see.</text></string>

<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_0"><text>Did Ivar stop by to see you?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1"><text>He did before leaving, asked for a working PDA.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_2"><text>And where did he go?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_3"><text>Who knows? Seemed like he was going to gather what was left of his group. They searched and searched for something and never found it, only got lost themselves. But he’s back to normal now, he’ll take care of himself. Though if he really wants to find the “Black Mark”, then hardly...</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_4"><text>The Mark? What does he need it for?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_5"><text>That’s a question! How would I know? Or maybe I misunderstood him... Ivar took a hard hit after all, and his speech hasn’t fully recovered yet.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_6"><text>Strange. He mentioned that Strelok was interested in the “Black Mark”... What else did Ivar say?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_7"><text>Nothing really, said goodbye and that was it. Mumbled something like “Strelok might have been right” or something along those lines. I was busy, you know? Didn’t listen too closely.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_81"><text>Did you ever talk with him about flooded tunnels and pumps? Maybe not this time, but earlier? Or maybe you yourself know something about it? Found something like that in papers or on a PDA... No?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_82"><text>Did you ever talk with him about flooded tunnels and pumps? Maybe not this time, but earlier?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_91"><text>We didn’t talk about anything like that with Ivar, but... I think I came across references to documentation on this topic... If memory serves, it should be searched for in the underground laboratory with index X-12. And why do you need all this, if it’s not a secret?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_92"><text>Definitely not. As far as I remember, something like that flashed by in the papers you brought me recently. So you really got the urge to clarify this topic in more detail?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_101"><text>Just want to check one guess. Thanks for the tip, Docent. I’ll go get ready for the road...</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1021"><text>Yeah, I did. So will you help? This is extremely important to me right now.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1022"><text>Yeah, I did. Listen, I helped you with your financial problems, so now you return the favor. This is extremely important to me right now.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_103"><text>And it’s extremely important for me to sort out my financial problems. By the way, I already stated my price on this matter — two third-tier artifacts in good condition. Forgot, didn’t you?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1032"><text>Well... Yes, of course, I’ll help however I can. I’ll still owe you anyway.\nWait a bit, I’ll check my notes on the laptop. All info that might be of interest to me or to those who regularly come to me, like you for example, I prefer to convert into electronic format.\nOh-ho... I don’t want to upset you, Marked One, but I can’t really tell you anything particularly useful about the tunnel-pumps. Except that control of the power supply and control of the pumps themselves are carried out from different locations. And the pumping installations themselves are located somewhere in a third place altogether. Something like that...</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_10411"><text>With you around, you’d forget how indeed. You never miss a chance to remind me how much I owe you. Here are the artifacts, satisfied?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_10412"><text>Didn’t forget, didn’t forget. You’ll get your artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1042"><text>Hmph... I expected more. What use is this information to me...</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_105"><text>Quite so. Wait a bit, I’ll check my notes on the laptop. All info that might be of interest to me or to those who regularly come to me, like you for example, I prefer to convert into electronic format.\nOh-ho... I don’t want to upset you, Marked One, but I can’t really tell you anything particularly useful about the tunnel-pumps. Except that control of the power supply and control of the pumps themselves are carried out from different locations. And the pumping installations themselves are located somewhere in a third place altogether. Something like that...</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1052"><text>I understand your dissatisfaction, Marked One. I admit, I myself am baffled. It seemed to me that the last time I skimmed through the papers you brought, there was much more there... Stop! What an idiot I am! Remember how I told you that some guy tried to sell me similar documents, and I didn’t take them?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_106"><text>Are you kidding me? And I gave you two excellent artifacts for this information? That’s not how business is done, Docent...</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_1062"><text>I understand your indignation, Marked One. I admit, I myself can’t make sense of how it turned out this way. It seemed to me that the last time I skimmed through the papers you brought, there was much more there... Stop! What an idiot I am! Remember how I told you that some guy tried to sell me similar documents, and I didn’t take them?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_107"><text>Oh no! Don’t tell me you mixed up which documents you found what I desperately need in now! And what am I supposed to do? What was that stalker’s name, where do I look for him now?</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_108"><text>Alas, that’s the kind of blunder it was... What was his name, what was his name... I honestly don’t remember. I saw him that day for the first and last time. Where to look — no idea either. Although... there is one lead. When I politely asked him to leave, he blurted out something like “well, screw you, I’ll sell it to Tooth.” If the deal went through, then go to that trader. As far as I know, he should be in Limansk now.\nOh, and one more thing: some suspicious-looking guy was hanging around here recently. First talked to the Barman about something, then came to see me. He also asked about tunnels, underground laboratories, and some kind of tools. But I brushed him off, said I didn’t know anything. He seemed way too shady to me.</text></string>
<string id="docent_tonnel_dialog_109"><text>Aha! Tooth buys up everything, so there’s a chance. That guy’s no gift, of course, but you can deal with him. Especially if you offer the right price. All right, let’s say you helped me. And about the suspicious guy — noted. Take care.</text></string>

<string id="docent_2_tonnel_dialog_0"><text>Hi, Docent. I’m back to you again about the tunnel-pumps...</text></string>
<string id="docent_2_tonnel_dialog_11"><text>I’m busy right now... Ah, to hell with it! I’ll tear myself away from my work for a bit. I owe you anyway.\nWait a bit, I’ll check my notes on the laptop. All info that might be of interest to me or to those who regularly come to me, like you for example, I prefer to convert into electronic format.\nOh-ho... I don’t want to upset you, Marked One, but I have nothing useful to report on your question. Except that control of the power supply and control of the pumps themselves are carried out from different locations. And the pumping installations themselves are located somewhere in a third place altogether. Something like that...</text></string>
<string id="docent_2_tonnel_dialog_12"><text>I’m busy right now... Ah, to hell with it! I’ll tear myself away from my work for a bit. We agreed on two artifacts, right? Did you bring them?</text></string>
<string id="docent_2_tonnel_dialog_221"><text>Of course. Will these do?</text></string>
<string id="docent_2_tonnel_dialog_222"><text>Yeah... Where are they?! I was sure I put them in my backpack. Wait a bit, I’ll bring them soon...</text></string>

<string id="bar_merc_dialog_0"><text>So, what’s new around here?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_1"><text>What’s new... There are hardly any people left, can’t you see? Fewer and fewer every day, everyone’s heading north, and only a handful come back. Where do they all disappear to, what kind of black hole do they fall into? Have you been there yourself, or are you still just getting ready?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_2"><text>Hard to say... Feels like I was, and feels like I wasn’t.</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_3"><text>Ah, right. You’re, well — not quite right in the head. You remember some things, forget others... \nBy the way, a guy stopped by here, asking about someone with an unusual tattoo on their arm. I thought of you right away. You’ve got that distinctive mark on your wrist, don’t you?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_4"><text>Well, yeah. So what?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_5"><text>And that’s it. The guy acted all important, businesslike. Talked like he was giving orders. Ask him anything — and he snaps back that it’s none of your business, while he himself just keeps asking questions.</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_6"><text>And why would he need me?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_7"><text>Why you specifically? He didn’t name any names, and you yourself supposedly don’t even remember what your name is. Or have you remembered it already?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_8"><text>I remember everything just fine now. And I’m not sick. My name is the Marked One. I am the Marked One. Clear?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_9"><text>Alright, Marked One it is, marked by a sign... So, that’s who he needed — someone marked by the sign. I don’t recall a second one like that. Draw your own conclusions.</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_10"><text>Not enough data yet to draw conclusions. Anything else?</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_11"><text>I told him I couldn’t help, that the Zone’s full of people and every second one’s probably got something tattooed. And he replied: if someone with a strange mark does turn up, tell him they’ll be waiting for him at the Warehouses, at the bus stop on the road to the Red Forest. So I’m passing that on.</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_12"><text>At the Warehouses... Must’ve been a mercenary, then.</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_13"><text>Could be. Go there and find out for yourself.</text></string>
<string id="bar_merc_dialog_14"><text>Not sure I need that meeting. We’ll see how things go.</text></string>

<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_0"><text>Do you know where Ghost went?</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_1"><text>No. And I don’t want to know!</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_2"><text>Why’s that?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_3"><text>That Ghost of yours is a real operator. He brought some armed gang with him that nearly trashed the place, and then vanished without a trace.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_4"><text>You must be mistaken. Ghost is a loner, he’s not connected to any gang.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_5"><text>Well, maybe he didn’t bring them, maybe they came to him — what difference does it make. They barged in, started bossing everyone around, asking about some tools for some kind of weapon, making demands, threatening... I had to put them in their place by mentioning just a few high-ranking names overseeing our work. Before that Ghost showed up, we never had this kind of bacchanalia here. I even warned Professor Vasilyev not to get involved with such shady characters. But no! And here’s the result — Vasilyev is still in a vegetative state, and thugs are storming scientific laboratories.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_6"><text>I don’t see a connection here. And aren’t you exaggerating? Stalkers are always wandering around here, all armed, any of them can start waving weapons if they really want something. By that logic, you could call anyone a thug.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_7"><text>Manners, young man. You can tell a person by their manners, weapons or no weapons. And I won’t let that Ghost of yours even set foot on my doorstep again.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_8"><text>Will you throw him out yourself, or assign it to a graduate student?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_9"><text>No need to be sarcastic. Of course, I can’t stand up to brute force, but one thing’s certain — he won’t get anything more from me. And enough about Ghost, let’s change the subject. What brings you here? Your account is still open.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_sakharov_dialog_10"><text>I don’t need anything right now.</text></string>

<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_0"><text>Semenov, can you tell me what happened here? What was all that noise, what kind of raid was it?</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_1"><text>There was no raid at all. And no real noise either, except for Sakharov’s own screeching.</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_2"><text>So who was it that came?</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_3"><text>Some well-equipped types showed up. Started questioning Sakharov, barged into his office, rummaged around on the desks without any ceremony. But no shouting, all businesslike. They were looking for something specific.</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_4"><text>So what about your security?</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_5"><text>Very funny... Our security is good against monsters. But here — either they didn’t notice them, or didn’t want to notice, or didn’t dare. I locked myself in that little room and didn’t stick my head out. All I heard was some mumbling and movement. And Sakharov’s shouts and his “threats” to call someone.</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_6"><text>So what does Ghost have to do with it? And what did they want?</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_7"><text>Nothing at all! Ghost wasn’t mentioned at all. That’s just the professor imagining things, trying to find someone to blame. I didn’t open the door, heard things vaguely, and didn’t understand everything I heard. I asked Sakharov, but he didn’t understand much either. Long story short, someone told them that we might have special tools here for some kind of special weapon. That’s probably what they were looking for.</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_8"><text>You’re issued special weapons?</text></string> 
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_9"><text>You too?! No, of course not. Sakharov told them the same — that we don’t have anything like that and don’t deal with it at all, that we do biological and... well, completely different research. And they listened to him very attentively, but kept doing their thing. I could hear them moving crates behind the wall. Like the saying goes — “Vaska listens, but keeps eating.” Sakharov went on about “I’ll call, I’ll report!..” They rustled around a bit more and left. Maybe they really took in what Sakharov said, or maybe they realized there was nothing there and no point searching, and backed off.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_101"><text>Hmm... Someone told me about “Monolith weapons.” Could that be the special weapon in question? Supposedly it also requires a whole suitcase of tools. Still, I doubt you could hide that in a desk drawer.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_102"><text>Yeah... Still, it’s interesting what they could have meant. What kind of weapon, what kind of tools? Any ideas?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_111"><text>You listen to all sorts of fairy tales... Although Doctor Perelman once talked about some tools to grab something and place it into a sealed container. But I think he was talking about an artifact. Or maybe he was actually talking about the “Black Mark,” wanted to put it into a container.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_112"><text>Who knows?! Anything’s possible... For example, Doctor Perelman once talked about some tools to grab something and place it into a sealed container. But I think he was talking about an artifact. Or maybe he was actually talking about the “Black Mark,” wanted to put it into a container. </text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_12"><text>Tell me more.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_13"><text>There’s nothing more to tell... That’s how rumors are born and nonsense spreads across the Zone. And then someone filters those stupid rumors and starts a “treasure hunt.”</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_semenov_dialog_14"><text>Rumors, you say? Uh-huh...</text></string>

<string id="monolit_instruments_second_51"><text>So why are you loitering here? Can’t you see — I’m thinking. Get lost, go chase dogs...</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_52"><text>Some thinker you are...</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_101"><text>Hey, man, what do you want?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_102"><text>Well, one of your guys asked me to bring him a little thing, promised mountains of gold, and then disappeared somewhere.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_103"><text>So he disappeared, big deal. Did you find what he needed?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_104"><text>I... didn’t bring it with me... stashed it for now. I actually wanted to ask him a few things. You haven’t heard that story about a suitcase of tools, have you? And about some Sniper...</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_105"><text>Ah... so he was feeding you that mono-gun crap too? Really got on my nerves with that talk. But if you’re curious, I’ll tell you. Supposedly he met a scientist, and that one started spinning some tale about a super-duper weapon. You can’t just use it, supposedly — you need special tools. And it wasn’t about Sniper at all, but about Strelok himself... well, you get it. People will make up anything.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_106"><text>I see... So the tool belongs to Strelok, huh? Where did you say that scientist was, and what was his name?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_107"><text>Oh come on, you actually bought that? Somewhere in Yantar, I think... Others already came by asking too. But it’s all nonsense.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_108"><text>I’m just asking so I don’t have to listen to that nonsense again... So who was it that came?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_109"><text>You’re really getting on my nerves with the questions! Who, who... A horse in a coat. Took the coat off and left. You drinking? No? Then beat it, stop bothering me.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_110"><text>Alright, calm down... You’ve already got drinking buddies, and I’m not in the mood. Just don’t drink away your coat.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_201"><text>You keep poking around, poking around... No peace.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_second_202"><text>Peace will be in the grave. And even that’s not guaranteed.</text></string>

<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_0"><text>Hi, Zub. I’ve got some business for you.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_1"><text>People only ever come to me on business, nobody invites me over for tea.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_2"><text>You’ll manage without tea... I know that recently one stalker was planning to sell you some papers concerning the operation of the system for pumping water out of tunnels connecting various facilities deep underground. I need to take a look at a few things in them.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_3"><text>Just like that, straight to the point? No easing into it, no asking how my health is, no telling me how you’re doing, no mentioning how you happen to know who was going to sell me what. Though it’s not hard to guess. Docent tipped you off, right? You don’t have to answer, no need to be Sherlock Holmes here.\nAs for the papers… they’re already gone, used to start a campfire. Don’t worry though, everything interesting was copied and rewritten onto other media.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_4"><text>Who would doubt it. I’d like to get acquainted with that knowledge. Care to bargain?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_5"><text>That depends on what exactly you need. Information comes in all kinds: important, very important, vitally necessary. And the price, naturally, will differ. Be specific about what interests you, and I’ll assess the level of importance. Then we’ll decide whether there’s even any point in bargaining, yeah?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_6"><text>Basically, the topic is this: there’s a flooded tunnel, and there are pumps that can be used to drain it. I want to know exactly where that tunnel is, how to get into it, and how the water can be pumped out.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_7"><text>And that’s all? What about the motive? You expect me to believe you dragged yourself all the way here and are ready to pay out of sheer curiosity? Or are you hinting that Zub’s gotten a bit dull?\nWhere does that little tunnel lead?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_8"><text>I’m saying there’s a commodity, there’s a seller, there’s a buyer — everything else doesn’t matter.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_9"><text>You’d be safe to take on a recon mission, Marked One. Solid as a rock. Not a single extra word slips out, huh? Admirable, on the one hand, but on the other… you could’ve been a bit more forthcoming. In exchange for a discount, for example. Ah well, we’ll see.\nAnyway, come back in about half an hour. I need to check my notes and have a word with a couple of people. So take a walk.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_zub_dialog_10"><text>Uh-huh. I’ll be back soon.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_0"><text>What’s the situation with our tunnel business?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_11"><text>You showed up too early. I’m waiting for one message. Once I get it, we’ll talk.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_12"><text>You’re just in time. So, here’s how it is: I’ve got the code for the door to the flooded tunnel you’re so eager to get into. You do know it’s locked with a keypad, right? That’s one. There’s information on where power is supplied to the pumps. That’s two. And I also roughly know the place where they’re switched on. Where do we start?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_2"><text>With the price. Is it approximate too? Or exact?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_3"><text>For the door code — a dummy artifact. For pointing out the power supply location — a couple of dummy artifacts, or we can haggle.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_4"><text>And what do you want for the tip on where to switch on the pumps?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_5"><text>That’s a separate conversation. Artifacts won’t be enough here. But we’ll get to that later.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_2_zub_dialog_6"><text>Got it. Give me a moment, I’ll size up my options so I know what I can bargain with.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="after_mon_3_zub_dialog_0"><text>So where does the power to the pumps get supplied from?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_3_zub_dialog_1"><text>And did you bring the payment?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_3_zub_dialog_2"><text>Remind me, what was it you needed again...</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_3_zub_dialog_3"><text>Two Dummies.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_3_zub_dialog_4"><text>You said we could haggle a bit—so let's do it!</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_3_zub_dialog_5"><text>Alright, let's. I take it all this is important and urgent for you. I'm ready to knock off one Dummy if you find me a part for a scanner.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_3_zub_dialog_6"><text>What?! What scanner now?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_3_zub_dialog_7"><text>An ordinary one! What backwater are you from anyway? It's the 21st century out there. You think I copy all the documents by hand? Some things have to be scanned. And some damn thing in it burned out. Docent took a look, called it something or other, I don't remember. Mikhailych could help get the part, but he won't promise anything sooner than two weeks.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_3_zub_dialog_8"><text>Oh! So that's how it is. Means you need it urgently too. Then knock the price down some more.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_3_zub_dialog_9"><text>Fine, you convinced me. Get the scanner spare part and we'll call it even.\nI think you should ask the nerds, preferably the ones at the Swamps. Their base is new in the Zone, their equipment is modern. Hopefully they haven't sold or drunk it all away yet.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_3_zub_dialog_101"><text>The Swamps?! Nah, I won't be looking for your part. Time's not waiting. I think I had some Dummies somewhere, just need to dig them out.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_3_zub_dialog_102"><text>Scribble the model on a sheet, or whatever it is. I'll look for the part or try to find two Dummies.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_3_zub_dialog_11"><text>Then it's settled. Just keep in mind, Tooth won't wait forever.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="after_mon_4_zub_dialog_0"><text>Let's talk about the door code.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_4_zub_dialog_1"><text>Got the payment ready?</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_4_zub_dialog_21"><text>I just remembered... I've got one clever little gadget, so the code doesn't interest me anymore. Let's drop it.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_4_zub_dialog_22"><text>Brought a Dummy. I'm listening.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_4_zub_dialog_23"><text>Not yet. Thought maybe your conscience had gotten the better of you.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_4_zub_dialog_31"><text>Suit yourself. Your gadget might jam. But hey, owner knows best, as they say.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_4_zub_dialog_32"><text>The right decision. Write down the code: 922758.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_4_zub_dialog_33"><text>I traded my conscience for chewing gum back in school.</text></string>
<string id="after_mon_4_zub_dialog_42"><text>Great, that's settled then.</text></string>

<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_0"><text>I'm here about the payment.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_1"><text>Did you bring everything?</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_201"><text>Take your Dummies.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_202"><text>I found your part, packed up in a box.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_203"><text>Just checking, thought maybe you'd changed your mind.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_3"><text>Excellent. I knew you'd get it all done.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_4"><text>Knew it, huh... Alright, about the pump hookup. What is it?</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_5"><text>Here's the thing... There were no exact instructions in those papers. All that's known is that power can be supplied from another underground complex, where nerds used to live. It's somewhere in the Dark Valley, but I guarantee it's not X-18. As for any other underground sites there, I don't know. You?</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_6"><text>I know, I know. You trying to squeeze info out of me on top of the payment I already gave you or what? Go on.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_7"><text>That's all, Marked One. Besides, you got what I'm talking about, right?</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_8"><text>What do you mean, "that's all"?! And where are the pumps started? There too?</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_9"><text>No, somewhere else... But from this point on, we move on to the main thing.\nWord reached me that you met the Monolithians on Radar.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_10"><text>What do those frostbitten lunatics have to do with the pumps?</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_11"><text>No idea yet, maybe they do. Someone flooded that tunnel, after all. Huh?\nYou heard anything about their weapons? They say the stuff crumbles to dust the moment you pick it up. They also say someone wants to find a way around that... What's got you thinking?</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_12"><text>Just turning thoughts over in my head, figuring out where you're going with this. Whether I should tell you to get lost right away, or hear you out.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_13"><text>Hear me out, it gets more interesting.\nThere's a group of people who've almost found such a way. They got some equipment, or a device, or a tool... bottom line, an object that in theory can slow down the decay process, or even freeze it entirely. And now all they need is the weapon itself.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_14"><text>Let them go to the Monolithians and politely ask for it.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_15"><text>Don't get smart, Marked One. The whole trick is that the tool seems to exist, and the weapon can supposedly be found too, but no one can actually pick it up.\nI don't know who put this idea in their heads, but now they're looking for a man with a tattoo like yours. For some reason, they decided that people like that have a chance of handling Monolithian weapons. You could play that angle, and at the same time check whether it's all true. Aren't you curious to find out why you're so “special”?</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_16"><text>You hinting that I'm akin to the Monolithians? Hm... So what's in it for you in all this? I know you won't lift a finger unless there's something in it for you.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_17"><text>Long story short, there are interested parties—let's call them competitors to the group looking for a way to take Monolithian weapons out of the Zone. Consider me a representative of this competing organization. They want solid proof that the tool exists—or whatever you want to call it—and that it really does allow someone to handle the weapon. And if that's the case, they'll enter the game themselves.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_18"><text>You really spun a tale there, Tooth. Sounds like a full-blown spy thriller.\nI do know that some mercs are looking for me, and I know where their base is at the Army Warehouses. It's very possible they're after me for exactly the reason you mentioned. But what then? You're suggesting I go to them, borrow the tool, then find a Monolithian weapon and try to pick it up? Bold plan!</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_19"><text>Don't play dumb, Marked One. As far as I know, you're the only one in the whole Zone with such a mark. I heard there were others once... there were, but they're all gone. So you have a certain privileged status and can use it. You won't be able to dictate terms to these people, of course, but haggling is very much an option. For starters, just go there, talk to them, find out their plans. They’re unlikely to start twisting your arms right away—they won’t expect you to show up on your own. Once you get the lay of the land, come back to me.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_20"><text>You've got everything running smooth as silk... but there is sense in what you're saying. And I myself can't get any peace over this strange connection of mine to the Monolith and this mark on my hand... But that no longer concerns you.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_21"><text>I don't need your secrets. I've got enough of my own. Bottom line—head straight to the Warehouses, to the merc camp. From time to time, a certain man shows up there looking for you. Though you probably already know that. And I'll be waiting for results.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_22"><text>Why didn't you say all this right away? You really dragged it out...</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_tunnel_dialog_23"><text>If I'd told you right away, you might've refused. I needed to see how badly you wanted to drain that tunnel. This way, you've already invested in it, got half of what you wanted—would be stupid to turn back now.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_0"><text>Found out something about the tool.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_1"><text>Spill it.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_2"><text>I met one “stitcher” at the Army Warehouses. According to him, the tool definitely exists, and it’s meant exclusively for the weapons the Monolithians wield. The guy made that absolutely clear to me.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_3"><text>So I’m supposed to pass your honest scout’s oath on to the client? And what, after that talk they just let you go, no strings attached?</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_4"><text>Let me go… for now. They need me, you know that yourself. They’ll be waiting for me on Radar, near the entrance to the old lab. I’m supposed to come and show them where in that lab I saw a Monolithian gun… there was a story, not important now. In theory, it should still be there. Most likely, they’ll hand me those very tools so I can try to pick the weapon up. And if I do what they want, then there really won’t be any options left. I don’t think they’ll let me out of there alive.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_5"><text>I don’t get them… Has it even crossed anyone’s mind that you might just not go there?</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_6"><text>They need me to come of my own free will. Nobody knows what kind of technology it is, why the weapon falls apart, what it depends on. Could be body temperature, could be smell, could be your emotions, or even your intent—the desire to take it in your hands. Hell knows. Either way, this is a real chance for me to find out whether I really do have some kind of “kinship” with the Monolithians… and if so, I need to understand what that gives me.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_7"><text>Yeah… there’s definitely something in you, no doubt about it. Aren’t you afraid you’ll end up like them yourself before long? Sitting all day, rocking your head, mumbling something under your breath…</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_8"><text>Afraid or not—what difference does it make? Trying to motivate me some more? Don’t bother. I can feel that one way or another I’ll have to crawl into that lab. If I don’t go willingly, they’ll drag me in on a rope, like a cow to the slaughterhouse. They won’t let me slip away anymore—I keep catching the looks of some shady types on me. They’re waiting for me to ripen, but they won’t wait long.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_9"><text>And that lab has only one entrance? A structure like that isn’t some potato cellar. Evacuation routes should be thought out. Can’t you somehow… well, you know.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_10"><text>That’s exactly what I’m counting on… I’m not a fool, not about to stick my own neck in a noose. But I’m not sure I’ll find the exit again. Not sure at all. And there’s no point leading them to another entrance either—then they’ll surely set up cordons at both. And without the tool, there’s no way either…</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_11"><text>Bottom line, Marked One, I’m not asking for much. Just show me that tool at least, so I can be sure. I can’t just pass on your assurances. My reputation matters to me too.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_12"><text>No promises, I haven’t even seen it with my own eyes yet. Anyway, if it works out, we’ll see each other again; if not—don’t hold it against me.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_13"><text>Well then, shake on it and farewell. You should lay out a spread for your buddies before the road. If you’re heading out, do it proper. So they remember you. Heh-heh…</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_merc_dialog_14"><text>Funny guy… I don’t have any buddies. Though… it might be worth dropping by the Doctor one last time. He didn’t abandon me when I was in trouble and took care of me as best he could. And there are a couple of things I still want to ask him. If I’m saying goodbye to anyone, it’s only him. Too early to think about that, but who knows how it’ll all turn out…</text></string>

<string id="marsh_lampa_dialog_4"><text>Honestly, very much.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_lampa_dialog_51"><text>Don’t worry, we’ll take a look. You hand over a preserved monster part to us for scientific purposes, and I give you the scanner part. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_lampa_dialog_61"><text>No objections. Especially since I won’t need them anymore.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_lampa_dialog_62"><text>What if I have something fresh? Won’t that work?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_lampa_dialog_72"><text>Our assistants need a part that’s been lying in that preservative for a long time.

<string id="marsh_lampa_2_dialog_21"><text>A controller’s hand.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_lampa_2_dialog_22"><text>A pseudogiant’s paw.</text></string>

<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_101"><text>Who are you, and what do you want?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_1021"><text>Hi. I’m the Marked One. Just passing through on business. Don’t think I’ve seen you here before, so I figured I’d say hello.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_1022"><text>Hi. You the boss around here? Heard someone was looking for me. I’m the Marked One. And I’ve got the tattoo on my arm, see.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_103"><text>Ah! Came on your own. So this is what you’re like, Marked One. Well, have a seat, let’s talk.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_104"><text>Thanks, I’ll stand. I won’t be long.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_105"><text>That depends. The talk could be quick, or you might end up staying here for good.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_1061"><text>Let’s not start with threats, old man. Judging by how you reacted to me showing up, you need something from me. I’d like to know what exactly.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_1062"><text>Let’s not start with threats, old man. You didn’t look for a man with a tattoo like this just to bury him in the nearest bushes, did you? You need something from me, and I’d like to know what exactly.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_107"><text>Right to the point? Fine. I’m a straightforward man too, Marked One, so I’ll say it as it is. There are two options on the table: either we don’t waste time and stitch you up right here and now, or we squeeze the information out of you first and stitch you up after.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_108"><text>I already told you—cut the scare tactics. I’m used to it. Maybe you’ll finally get to the point?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_109"><text>You think I’m bluffing? You’re wrong. But fine... For starters, tell me who you are.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_110"><text>I’m the Marked One. Just a regular stalker, that’s all. You, on the other hand, haven’t introduced yourself.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_111"><text>Regular, huh... You know, it’s not every day that special orders come down on regular stalkers, with this kind of fuss over finding them.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_112"><text>You’d know better. So what’s the reason for all this fuss, as you put it?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_113"><text>The request for you didn’t come from some local police department, get my drift? It came from a very influential... structure, let’s call it that. And as soon as it was taken up, you vanished like you’d sunk into water. Turned out you’d headed toward Pripyat, and after that—no traces. Anywhere. We figured that was it, finished material. And then you show up. Been at the Bar, been at Yantar... And now—there you are, showed up here yourself. So where have you been hiding, Marked One?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_114"><text>I was sick. Caught a bad cold, pneumonia, laid low for a while... Got a bit better and showed up. Thanks, of course, for your “structure” being so concerned about me, but if that’s all you wanted to say, I’ll be on my way.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_115"><text>A joker, huh? That’s fine, we’ll knock that nonsense out of you fast enough. I need to send a message to someone, so go take a walk for about fifteen minutes.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_116"><text>Going to ask for instructions? So you’re not the boss after all... And what, you’re just letting me go like that? What if I get sick again, and this time—for a very long while?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_117"><text>Don’t worry, we’ll “cure” you real quick. And where are you going to go now, with a mug as recognizable as yours? You’ll be easy to track anywhere—you won’t get lost.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_118"><text>Alright. Go confer, and I’ll come back later.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_151"><text>What now? I told you—go take a walk for now.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_152"><text>You writing a poem over there or something? Alright, alright, I’m going.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_201"><text>Yeah, you’re just in time, Marked One. I was already about to send my boys after you.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_202"><text>No need to send the boys right away. You could’ve just dropped me a message on the PDA if you were waiting that badly. So, what did the boss say?</text></string>

<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_203"><text>If I were you, I wouldn’t be so eager to know too much. Let’s talk business.\nAccording to Wolfhound, you, Marked One, likely possess some kind of unusual ability. Wolfhound was way too soft with you—clearly thought you’d open up on your own and spill everything. Should’ve squeezed you harder right away and beaten the information out of you.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_204"><text>I wouldn’t say Wolfhound was exactly coddling me. And I don’t have any special abilities to speak of.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_205"><text>Don’t play dumb like you don’t get what this is about. Wolfhound blabbed plenty to you: about the special weapon, about how it can’t just be taken out of the Zone, and about the Monolithians who were looking for a man with a tattoo like yours.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_206"><text>Yeah, that did come up... By the way, where is Wolfhound himself?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_207"><text>Far away. Very far. But don’t dodge the subject.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_208"><text>Right, we did talk about the Monolithians and their special weapon. Supposedly you can’t take it—it falls apart right in your hands or something like that. I thought he was just spinning a yarn. So that kind of weapon really exists? There must be some special device or tool needed, if you can’t take it by hand...</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_209"><text>I see you know more than you should. Who told you about the tool? You figured out right that we need you alive, so we won’t kill you. At least not right now. But, say, trimming down the number of fingers on your hands if you keep playing the fool—that’s easy enough. So spill everything. Last time I’m asking nicely.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_2101"><text>Wait, wait, commander... Easy. One guy—I ran into him by chance once in Limansk—said while drunk that some scientist had lost a tool for a Monolith gun. I figured it was just another drunken rant. He was talking about a tool, but I didn’t get what kind of gun it was. Thought “Monolith” meant something big. And now you reminded me of my talk with Wolfhound about a weapon that shoots electric fire, and that drunken chatter popped back into my head... so I put two and two together. But the tool itself...</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_2102"><text>Easy now, don’t get worked up... I think I remember—I had a talk with some... scientist. He mentioned something about special weapons and special tools. Seemed like someone was actively searching for them around the Zone. I didn’t think much of it back then. You never know who’s got what problems. And now you reminded me of my talk with Wolfhound about a weapon that shoots electric fire, and that chatter popped back into my head... so I put two and two together. But the tool itself...</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_2103"><text>No one told me anything about a tool, cross my heart! Maybe there is no such thing... I just figured that if there’s such a unique gun that spits electric fire, then you’d only be able to take it with some special device, since otherwise it crumbles to dust right away!</text></string>

I can tell by your eyes that you do. One shot—and you’ll spill everything. I’m only afraid this drug has an unpleasant side effect—the chances of ending up a complete idiot for life are pretty high.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_304"><text>So... decided to lead with your trump cards right away, huh? Consider me impressed. What do you want to know?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_305"><text>You know about the Monolithians, right? Lately they’ve got new guns—unusual ones. Accuracy almost one hundred percent, stopping power—don’t even get me started! Some corporations abroad would really love to “ride the wave” and outdo their competitors in supplying this kind of weaponry. But here’s the paradox—the gun exists, it kills just fine, but you can’t take it! Not even with any kind of grabbers. You try to pick it up and—poof—nothing but black smoke. So we’re looking for at least some kind of lead that would let us take such weapons out of the Zone and, so to speak, take them apart. Figure out the principle.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_306"><text>Very interesting story. Can’t say I’ve heard anything like that among stalkers.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_307"><text>Interrupt me with your jokes one more time and we’ll see if you keep joking after a shot of that “serum.”\nNow, where was I?! Ah... There’s information that the Monolithians were looking for you. Well, maybe not you personally, but someone with a mark on his arm like yours. And we know for sure that you met with them. What did you talk about? Did you see any unusual weapons?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_308"><text>Nothing special... mostly listened to their philosophical ramblings. Not many Monolithians can even speak normally, and the ones who can would be better off keeping quiet. You’ll break your brain trying to figure out what they’re on about. As for weapons... no, I didn’t see anything like that.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_309"><text>Didn’t see any, huh? Think again. And think hard. This is your last chance. After that comes the jab.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_3091"><text>Ah! Just remembered something... One guy—I ran into him by chance once in Limansk—said while drunk that some scientist had lost a tool for a Monolith gun. I thought it was just another drunken rant. He was talking about a tool, but I didn’t understand what kind of gun it was. Figured “Monolith” meant something big. And then you started talking about a weapon that shoots electric fire, and that drunken chatter popped back into my head... so I put two and two together. But the weapon itself...</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_3092"><text>Ah! I remember now—I had a conversation with some... scientist. He mentioned something about special weapons and special tools. Seems like someone is actively searching for them around the Zone. I didn’t pay much attention back then. You never know who’s got what problems. And then you started talking about a weapon that shoots electric fire, and that chatter popped back into my head... so I put two and two together. But the weapon itself...</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_3093"><text>Cross my heart, I didn’t see anything... Do you really think I wouldn’t notice some unusual monstrosity spitting electric fire?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_3101"><text>Aha! Fear loosens the tongue right away and you stop thinking every move through, huh? I never told you the weapon shoots fire. And your drunk couldn’t have known that. That only became known when the path to the north opened up. Which means you’ve seen the weapon in action! Where? When?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_3102"><text>Aha! Fear loosens the tongue right away and you stop thinking every move through, huh? I never told you the weapon shoots fire. And your scientist couldn’t have known that. That only became known when the path to the north opened up. Which means you’ve seen the weapon in action! Where? When?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_3103"><text>Aha! Fear loosens the tongue right away and you stop thinking every move through, huh? I never told you the weapon shoots fire.

<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_401"><text>Damn it... I screwed up! Yes, I did see such a weapon. By accident. I got a tip about an artifact stash, so I climbed into one lab on Radar. And there was some green freak sitting there. I got lucky and took him down first. He vanished right away, only the gun was left behind. I pick it up—and it slips out, pick it up again—it slips out again. Tried a few times, and it just keeps slipping away. I spat on it then, decided I’d try to find out later from people smarter than me how you’re supposed to take that weapon, and then come back for it. But somehow I never got around to it. Swear to God, that’s exactly how it was. I don’t know anything else.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_402"><text>So you’re saying the weapon is still there?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_403"><text>Well, probably... Where else would it go, if you can’t pick it up?!</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_404"><text>Didn’t you understand from everything you were told that the weapon falls apart immediately, at the very first contact with a human? Yet you claim you picked it up several times and it remained intact... So either you’re lying about having seen the weapon, or we didn’t waste all that effort looking for you for nothing. And we’re going to check that.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_405"><text>You’ll hand over the Monolithians’ weapon to me? Oh, right! It falls apart. So that means I’ll get the tools?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_406"><text>That’s not for me to decide, but I think so. At worst, to confirm your story, you’ll show our people how you take the gun with your bare hands. And then we’ll see.\nSo here’s how it is! We’ve known about the underground facilities on Radar for a long time, we just didn’t bother trying to get in before. But the emission is gone, and the situation has changed. We’ll send a couple of our groups to Radar to control the approaches to the bunkers, so no one gets in there and grabs the weapon out of stupidity ahead of time. We might even seal the doors. We’ll take a look around inside ourselves for now, and you’ll come later, when I send for you. You’ll show us where you saw the weapon, if we don’t find it ourselves. Then you’ll try to put it into a special container, and after that—we’ll play it by ear.</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_407"><text>Actually, I’ve got other things to do...</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_408"><text>Marked One, don’t start again! If you won’t come willingly, we’ll make you—we’ll bring you by force. But for now I’m asking politely. Because it’s preferable that you yourself want to come and yourself want to take that weapon. Who knows, maybe whether it rejects you or not depends on your intent. Everything has to be taken into account here. Assuming, of course, that all this is true...</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_409"><text>Alright, alright. I get it—I’ve got nowhere to run from you. I’ll wait for the call.</text></string>

<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_451"><text>You still alive and nobody’s stitched you up yet?</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_452"><text>Who the hell needs me?!</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_501"><text>You’re still wandering around... Didn’t you get the message that they’ve been waiting for you on Radar? Move it!</text></string>
<string id="gross_merc_start_dialog_502"><text>I’m going, I’m going... Bossy, aren’t you.</text></string>

<string id="doctor_last_dialog_0"><text>Doctor...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_1"><text>Ah, Marked One, decided to visit me again?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_2"><text>I came to say goodbye, sort of. We might not see each other again.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_3"><text>You’re rushing north again? Something still calling you?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_4"><text>Yes, but I won’t go where I’ve already been, I don’t see the point. I think I can get through by a different route, one Strelok didn’t take.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_5"><text>So you still want to find Strelok? You’ve understood who you are, come to terms with yourself. And everything else... Even if we imagine for a second that you meet Strelok, it’s unlikely he’ll tell you more than you already know about his exploits in the Zone and about the Zone itself.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_6"><text>To hell with him and his exploits! I don’t need Strelok. I want to get to the Monolith itself...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_7"><text>Why? Want to check if what they say about wish-granting is true? I think it’s just a myth.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_8"><text>Well, Strelok himself had a different opinion on that. And his notes won’t let me rest either... There’s something else.\nOne of the local brainiacs shared an interesting theory about an information field. All the information of this world is stored somewhere, in some kind of sphere. And the Monolith is like a terminal for accessing that storage.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_9"><text>The noosphere theory? Yes, I’m familiar with it. But there’s nothing about the Monolith in it.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_10"><text>That was his assumption. Whoever makes contact with this terminal could obtain knowledge about practically anything... And I still have questions coming out of my ears. What let me through to the center? Why did it lure me and not kill me, but send me back? Why is it luring me again? Why do the Monolithians treat me so loyally, almost accept me as an equal? They even tasked me with “planting seeds” in the “Matrices”? And those green creatures that were shooting at me—who are they?\nThis damned Monolith both draws me in and doesn’t accept me, and having rejected me, draws me in again... Ah, forget it.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_11"><text>You’re talking about the Monolith as if it were some living being. And why did you take those notes seriously? Why do you think they have anything to do with you?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_12"><text>It’s all about the Monolith weapon. You don’t know... I saw their special weapon. For all ordinary people who held it in their hands, it fell apart. But with me, it didn’t. Yes, I couldn’t take it—it was like it slipped out of my hands by itself—but it didn’t fall apart. It’s the same as with the Monolith—it wants to give, and yet it doesn’t. Why? So there’s something in me? I have to find out. The mercenaries are looking for that weapon now, I told them where I saw it. For some reason they desperately need it. And what I need from them are... special tools, to test my guesses... But that’s beside the point. Bottom line, I’m not sure I’ll come back from there...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_13"><text>You don’t have to go to them. And you don’t have to go north. Just throw it all out of your head and live your life.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_14"><text>I can’t not go anymore. And it’s better for me to come on my own, so I have at least some freedom to maneuver, than to be dragged there by force and given no choice at all.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_15"><text>Alright. You deal with the mercenaries, get from them what you need, reach the Monolith itself. What will you do there?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_16"><text>I don’t know for sure yet—it’ll be clear on the spot. I’ve thought about all this for a long time, but only now have the pieces of the puzzle finally started to come together. And here’s the version that seems most plausible to me. Whether I ended up in the Thicket by accident during Strelok’s experiment or he arranged it deliberately—it doesn’t really matter. He quickly figured out that the very person he’d been searching for so long and so unsuccessfully had literally fallen into his lap—a man with the Monolith’s psychocode implanted in his consciousness. One whom the Monolith does not perceive as an enemy, and therefore can let come close.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_17"><text>Listen, Marked One, you’re not...</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_18"><text>Let me finish, don’t interrupt.\nStrelok decided to hedge his bets. If he himself couldn’t break through to the Monolith, a backup player had to take the field. I’m somehow connected to the Monolith, and it may well be that this connection is two-way. Which means that if I manage to “reach out” to it, I can just as well try to “implant” a fragment of the human element into its essence. How? Hell if I know... Even by making a wish, as the legend says. Asking for power, for example, or immortality—what’s the difference?! I think the plan is very much in Strelok’s spirit. What do you think?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_19"><text>Well, you know... In my opinion, you need some rest.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_20"><text>We only dream of peace.\nYeah... What a sly type that Strelok is. He told the three of you to take care of me. He fooled Ghost, wrapping my persona in mystery. So much so that even the utterly unprincipled Ghost was, until recently, forced to keep an eye on me, albeit from a distance, instead of starting to beat everything he knew out of me. And the notes he left to Ivar... I’d bet my life there was far more information in them than was needed just to convince the Balt not to shut down the “Rainbow”. Strelok pulled it all off neatly, no denying it. Takes real talent to rake in the heat with other people’s hands. I applaud standing up.\nAlright, to hell with it... Doctor, I have one last question: do you know what a “time loop” is?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_21"><text>How should I put it... I once saw a picture of a snake devouring its own tail. I think it’s something like that. Like a trap you can’t escape from. Why do you ask?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_22"><text>One highly learned professor said that you can’t change cause and effect. Even if you invent a time machine and go back into the past, it’s still impossible to influence the future that way. This very loop will arise. So what if Strelok came to us from the future precisely for that reason? Not to destroy the Monolith, but to trap it—in a time loop?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_23"><text>I was happy when your memory came back, and now you’re at it again... What’s the point of all these musings? You shouldn’t be going anywhere, Marked One, there’s no sense in it.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_last_dialog_24"><text>No, Doctor, there is a point. At least for me. Thank you for everything, and goodbye. I’m unlikely to return.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="mercs_gun_1_start_dialog_101"><text>You finally showed up. We were already about to head out to help you, figured you wouldn’t make it on your own.</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_1_start_dialog_102"><text>Thanks, I can manage without your help somehow. So, what’s going on here?</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_1_start_dialog_103"><text>What was that nonsense you spun about the weapon? We searched two bunkers. Nothing there, only lost a fighter in the far bunker, by the antennas.</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_1_start_dialog_104"><text>Maybe it rolled off somewhere, but I definitely saw it. And I didn’t even know about the second bunker... Maybe it’s worth searching there first?</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_1_start_dialog_105"><text>There’s nothing there, and we sealed the door so the filth wouldn’t crawl out... Anyway, we’re done playing games with you. If everything you said is true, then here’s how it goes: you go into that bunker right now, our guy will be waiting for you there. You take the device from him and look for the weapon. You carry it out here in your hands so we can see right away that it’s on you. No jokes and no hide-and-seek! Until you find the weapon, you’re not coming out of there. And if it’s not there — well, then neither will you be.</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_1_start_dialog_106"><text>And if it’s already dissolved on its own, or that device doesn’t work... how is that my fault?</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_1_start_dialog_107"><text>Enough yapping! They’re still putting up with you for now, but that won’t last long. If it dissolves in your hands, that means you were useless to begin with. Bottom line: you’ve got ten minutes to enter the bunker. Come out without a Monolith weapon — we shoot, no questions asked. Bring out some other weapon — same thing. Try to run — we’ll dig you out from underground and finish you off.</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_1_start_dialog_108"><text>Hey! Hold on, the door there is coded, it’ll take time to crack it...</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_1_start_dialog_109"><text>And how do you think we got inside? The lock’s already busted, we’ve got a specialist for that. So, what are you standing around for? Get moving.</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_1_start_dialog_110"><text>Yeah, yeah, I’m going.</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_1_start_dialog_201"><text>Time’s ticking.</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_1_start_dialog_202"><text>Yeah, I remember...</text></string>

<string id="mercs_gun_2_dialog_101"><text>So you’re the brave and fearless one, huh?</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_2_dialog_102"><text>That’s me. Hand over the device.</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_2_dialog_103"><text>Take it, this damn thing’s worn my arms out — some kind of alloy, I guess... And my head’s been buzzing from it, too.</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_2_dialog_104"><text>Pretty heavy... Yeah, there really is something unsettling about this thing. You here alone? Not scared? All kinds of crap flies around here, throwing whatever it can.</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_2_dialog_105"><text>Two of our guys squeezed through a gap into the hangar with the Electras, checking it out one more time just in case. So you’ll go alone, no escort. If you whistled us a tune about the weapon, you’re gonna regret it — get ready for a warm welcome.</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_2_dialog_106"><text>Yeah, I’ve already heard that — how many times are you gonna repeat it?</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_2_dialog_201"><text>What are you standing around for? Get moving, grab the gun.</text></string>
<string id="mercs_gun_2_dialog_202"><text>You should get going already... back to your guys.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="zub_last_dialog_0"><text>Tooth, are you still waiting for the device?</text></string>
<string id="zub_last_dialog_1"><text>So you did manage to get it? Well done! I believed in you, and you were scared...</text></string>
<string id="zub_last_dialog_2"><text>You’ve got something to be afraid of too. I still don’t get how I made it out alive. I advise you to leave — they’re probably on my tail. They’ll show up here for sure.</text></string>
<string id="zub_last_dialog_3"><text>Don’t worry about me, I’ve been under fire before. Now hand it over, what kind of contraption is it?</text></string>
<string id="zub_last_dialog_41"><text>You see, Tooth... I’m not giving this thing to you.</text></string>
<string id="zub_last_dialog_42"><text>Fine, take it, this damn weight’s already right up to here for me!</text></string>
<string id="zub_last_dialog_51"><text>What’s that about? You wanna sell it yourself?!</text></string>
<string id="zub_last_dialog_52"><text>You’re a real champ. Yeah, there’s definitely something to this thing — it really does press on the brain. But it’s fine, I’ll stash it somewhere for the time being...</text></string>
<string id="zub_last_dialog_61"><text>No. I want to check something... I’ve got a theory.\nBut in case your memory’s gone soft, we agreed that I’d provide proof, not the device itself. Here it is, feast your eyes. What more do you want?</text></string>
<string id="zub_last_dialog_62"><text>Then tell me where the pumps are switched on.</text></string>
<string id="zub_last_dialog_71"><text>Well, yeah... Can I photograph this thing? I’ve got information that this crap was assembled using blueprints and instructions from some nerd. It’s powered by a very rare artifact. If they built one, then another can be built too, and we’ll find the artifact. The main thing was to understand that it really exists. And after you check your guesses, maybe you’ll still give it to me?</text></string>
<string id="zub_last_dialog_81"><text>We’ll see. Take the photos and tell me where to turn on the pumps.</text></string>
<string id="zub_last_dialog_9"><text>Pumps, so pumps... Those documents say that after supplying power, the water can be pumped out from the lab that has an exit to the "Tesla". It’s also connected to another lab, the one on Radar, but not X-12... Damn, I always get those indices mixed up, but I think you know what I’m talking about. And just in case numbers are more familiar to you — X-12 is exactly the lab where the entrance to your flooded tunnel is. That one you should definitely know.</text></string>
<string id="zub_last_dialog_10"><text>Uh-huh... sure. So you say an exit to the "Tesla"... I know where that is. That’s it, Tooth. Goodbye.</text></string>

<string id="ass_marker_dialog_0"><text>I went back to that tunnel where I saw your Mateyev.</text></string>
<string id="ass_marker_dialog_1"><text>And? Is he still there, or did he come with you?</text></string>
<string id="ass_marker_dialog_2"><text>He’s probably still sitting there. Stubborn ass... scared stiff, refuses to move. I did what you asked. He’ll be easy to find.</text></string>
<string id="ass_marker_dialog_3"><text>Excellent. He’ll be taken care of. And how shall we reward you?.. Are you interested in artifact transformation recipes? Or would you prefer our medical kits?</text></string>
<string id="ass_marker_dialog_41"><text>I’m interested in the recipes.</text></string>
<string id="ass_marker_dialog_42"><text>I’ll take the medical supplies, they won’t be extra.</text></string>
<string id="ass_marker_dialog_51"><text>Very well, then write it down.</text></string>
<string id="ass_marker_dialog_52"><text>Yes, health is more important, you know... Please accept a small additional sum to your account.</text></string>
<string id="ass_marker_dialog_6"><text>I’m tired, I’m leaving.</text></string>

<string id="lukash_vasilev_2_dialog_0"><text>So where did that weirdo go, the one who dropped in on you naked?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_2_dialog_1"><text>Some brainy young guy came by, from Sakharov, and took him with him.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_2_dialog_2"><text>Just like that?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_2_dialog_3"><text>Not just like that. Barely got him on his feet, our guys helped get him to the gate, loaded him into a chopper and that was it.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_2_dialog_4"><text>So Sakharov provided transport?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_2_dialog_5"><text>I didn’t bother figuring out who and what. They took him — good enough. What, were we supposed to keep feeding him, watering him, taking care of him, keeping him here on a leash? He’s not some zoo animal — he’s a person. The brainy one said he recognized someone in him and wants their boss to recognize him too. I didn’t object.</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_2_dialog_6"><text>Who did he recognize him as?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_2_dialog_7"><text>According to him: someone from their crowd. Why do you care?</text></string>
<string id="lukash_vasilev_2_dialog_8"><text>Just asking. Guy was here, now he’s gone... Curious.</text></string>

<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_0"><text>I wanted to ask how things turned out with that oddball at the Army Warehouses.</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_1"><text>Excuse me, what?</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_2"><text>Well, you asked for an assistant, your JR Mateyev, to be escorted. Remember?</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_3"><text>Ah, yes, yes! So did you escort him? Where is he now? He hasn’t been in contact.</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_4"><text>Uh... Well, he died, strayed off the route at the wrong time. I thought you already knew. I figured maybe you’d already sent someone else, so I asked.</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_5"><text>Died?! How could this happen! And you kept silent! How did you fail to protect him?</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_6"><text>I’m not a nanny, and this isn’t a kindergarten — it’s the Zone. I warned him not to let his guard down, but he just kept walking, whistling, humming some song about Galya, like he was at a resort and not in the Zone... That’s how he ended up where he shouldn’t have.</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_7"><text>My God... So young. What nonsense... How could you allow this...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_8"><text>I didn’t allow anything. How did you allow such grad students to be sent into the Zone? Yeah, he was young, but I’m not old either. And if I had died instead of him, would that have been better? Huh! What’s the point of talking now...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_9"><text>He’s probably hanging around the Bar somewhere.</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_10"><text>How can that be! You agreed to take him to the Army Warehouses. He’ll get lost...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_11"><text>What is he, a child, to get lost? A grown man. And we agreed that I’d only escort him as far as the Bar. Don’t worry, professor, he’ll find helpers there. An extra coin never hurts anyone. </text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_12"><text>Then why isn’t he making contact?</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_13"><text>Well, I don’t know. You can understand him — straight from the sea and right into the Zone. He hasn’t settled in yet. He’ll pull himself together and everything will be fine, don’t worry, he’ll bring that weirdo in.</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_14"><text>Let’s hope nothing has happened to him... And what are you waiting for? You didn’t take him to the Army Warehouses.</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_15"><text>Well, you see... getting through the Wild Territory isn’t exactly sweet either. The ammo consumption alone, and how many repair kits went into it...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_16"><text>Alright, alright, here’s compensation for your spent ammo...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_17"><text>And medical supplies were used too...</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_18"><text>That’s enough! You already have quite a tab here — don’t be stingy, buy instead of begging. Remember, young man: if you take a job, you finish it.</text></string>
<string id="assistant_bar_dialog_19"><text>Alright, I’ll remember...</text></string>

<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_0"><text>Sergeich said you needed help. How’s your dissertation coming along? I thought you were buried in work, processing the data.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_1"><text>The amount of material I’ve got on pseudogiants is pitiful.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_2"><text>Listen, Gluzov. I once ended up in an underground laboratory — the entrance was blocked, and there were no burrows at all. But the most interesting thing is, a pseudogiant was living there! And there was also a bubble hanging in the hall. Well, how do I explain it… like a balloon, but without an outer layer.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_3"><text>A bubble? Could it be a spatial portal? There’s a theory that bubbles in the Zone appear at points where space is punctured.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_4"><text>I don’t know whether it’s a portal or not, but the bubble is definitely there. And there’s other filth roaming around too. Where did it come from? Not out of thin air. Maybe it came through that portal.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_5"><text>You really saw a pseudogiant there?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_6"><text>I’m telling you for sure! Saw it as clearly as I see you.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_7"><text>Now that’s interesting! This could really broaden the topic… Pseudogiants alone are too narrow, we need to look wider. Because in that case, if these spatial anomalies actually function in some way, it could explain all the unpredictability and the strange fluctuations in monster population size. What prospects!</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_8"><text>Are you saying this to me right now?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_9"><text>I’m thinking out loud. You’ve given me hope, Marked One. Would you be willing to serve science a little?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_10"><text>Drag the pseudogiant out of that lab? I won’t manage that.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_11"><text>No, I think we can put the pseudogiant topic on hold for now. And start new research. Could you check where that portal leads?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_12"><text>Uh… Jump into the bubble? It’s high up. And probably dangerous — how would I know where I’ll come out?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_13"><text>You see, spatial tunnels are arranged in such a way that if there is an entrance, there must also be an exit. Moreover, the direction is bidirectional. That is, where you come out, you can also enter back from there. Theoretically. I’ll give you a recorder. Jump in, place it right there, under the second bubble where you come out, and immediately return.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_14"><text>What?! You make it sound so simple. Hop in, hop out. Have you been in that lab yourself? I nearly went gray there. Just getting into it was a feat, and now you’re suggesting I jump somewhere else. What do I need this for? And why did you decide that the portal even works? There are plenty of bubbles in the Zone — you step into them and get nothing.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_15"><text>You see, there was one study of a similar portal, unfortunately it collapsed long ago. During a blowout, at one of the entry points of the spatial tunnel… how should I put it… a clot of some unknown energy forms, which changes the properties of anomalous formations. Or artifacts, as you call them. That’s an interesting topic too, but right now I’m interested in the portal itself and registering movement through it… And if you say that monsters were present in a completely sealed space long ago, that’s what suggests the portal is open.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_16"><text>Hold on! Don’t overload me. Tell me straight — what’s in it for me? I respect science, sure, but understand me correctly. I’ve got my own interests, and you’ve got yours.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_17"><text>If we speak in your stalker language, then at the entry or exit point of a spatial portal during a blowout, artifacts can change their properties with a fairly high probability. A kind of quantum leap. And the pleasant news for you stalkers is that the change goes in the direction of improvement, if it even makes sense to talk about improvements of anomalous formations. But from your point of view — they can become better. As for the probability, it depends not so much on the blowout itself as on the portal — though it can vary…</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_18"><text>Now that’s a whole different conversation! So… do I understand correctly that if I leave, say, a slightly radioactive Jellyfish there, then after a blowout it might become completely free of negative properties? And what’s the probability of that happening?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_181"><text>No, to hell with science and this “improvement”. It’s too dangerous. I’ll think about it.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_19"><text>Yes, you’ve understood correctly. As for the probability… Look, I’m giving you the recorder. Move to the opposite end of that portal and leave it right at the landing point. After installation, the device will display a message indicating the start of operation. Once the blowout passes, retrieve it and bring it to me. I’ll get the data I need, and we’ll also understand the energy concentration in this specific portal. Then I’ll be able to answer your question about probability. But keep in mind — this is just an experiment. Nothing can be guaranteed. But if it works out, it will be a real breakthrough!</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_20"><text>Sounds like a worthwhile job. It’s just that the bubble is hanging pretty high. I’ll probably need jump artifacts, and more than one… Alright, I’ll figure something out. But you keep in mind too — since it’s an experiment, I don’t guarantee anything either.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_21"><text>Of course. Still, I’ll be waiting for results from you.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_dialog_22"><text>See you, science.</text></string>
<string id="tex_marsh_new_theme"><text>\nGluzov — a scientist from the Swamps — asks you to check where the portal from the X-18 control room leads. You need to somehow manage to jump into the bubble and leave the device at the exit point, then retrieve it after the blowout and bring it back to Gluzov.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_new_theme_2_dialog_0"><text>Well, you sure gave me a task with that bubble!</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_2_dialog_1"><text>So? Did it work out? You got into it and made it back?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_2_dialog_2"><text>As you can see, I’m standing in front of you, so I made it back. But if only you knew what it cost me.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_2_dialog_3"><text>I understand, I understand, the price of the matter and all that… But what about the device, did it record any data?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_2_dialog_4"><text>Here’s your little device. Did everything just like you said — tossed it, waited out the blowout, picked it up.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_2_dialog_5"><text>Let me quickly read some of the parameters and it’ll be clear that that’s exactly what happened…</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_2_dialog_6"><text>You don’t believe me? Well, read it.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_2_dialog_7"><text>Hmm… So… Yes, there really was a blowout… So… The data is there, it needs to be analyzed thoroughly. And regarding your probability, I can already tell you something.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_2_dialog_8"><text>Well, don’t keep me in suspense!</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_2_dialog_9"><text>Just a moment… let me estimate… Whoa! If I didn’t make a mistake in the calculations, it comes out to almost a 100% probability of artifact improvement during a blowout. But specifically at that point — that’s important. Plus or minus about ten meters. There are also several limitations. First, the artifact must not be degenerate, having lost all its anomalous properties. Second, the modulation of the energy field is such that it only affects artifacts no higher than the third category. And lastly — the release of energy occurs along an extremely narrow vector, and therefore can affect only one artifact per cycle. If even one condition is not met… well, if you want, you can check for yourself what will happen.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_2_dialog_10"><text>Almost 100 percent?! That’s something else, hard to believe! I should find a suitable artifact to test it on, something I wouldn’t mind losing too much if things go wrong. Especially since the terrain there is so unlucky that the artifact could easily roll off somewhere.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_2_dialog_11"><text>I get the hint. I actually have one just like that. If you simply decide to keep the artifact as a reward for your efforts, I won’t mind at all, but I’d still appreciate it if, when you get the chance, you try to improve it and then come back and tell me what came of it. And don’t forget to bring the resulting sample with you. Just please, don’t carry it on your belt, alright? As for the terrain… I think nothing terrible will happen if, to keep the artifact fixed in place, you put it… even into an ordinary backpack, the kind stalkers use to store their loot.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_2_dialog_12"><text>If everything works the way you said, I’ll find the time to drop by. See you.</text></string>
<!-- Äîáàâêà äëÿ 7.53 -->
<string id="petrenko_mdata1_dialog_0"><text>I’ve got a question. Do you know anything about the "Pendulums"?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata1_dialog_1"><text>I know there are such artifacts. Very rare, and therefore expensive.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata1_dialog_2"><text>Yeah, rare. How could I get my hands on one? Maybe there are recipes for them, ever heard of any?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata1_dialog_3"><text>Why are you asking me?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata1_dialog_4"><text>Because you seem to be on Yantar quite often, on good terms with the scientific crowd, I guess. Maybe someone mentioned those "Pendulums" to you over tea?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata1_dialog_5"><text>I don’t quite get you. Looking for an artifact, go to Sanya Banker. Need a recipe — go to Tooth. You’re not a rookie, after all.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata1_dialog_6"><text>Alright... let’s approach this from another angle. Do you know anything about the connection between "Pendulums" and "Labyrinths"? And most importantly, can they be used to bring memories back?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata1_dialog_7"><text>Ah! So that’s where you’re headed... At first I thought you wanted to make a killing brewing "Pendulums". But that’s a dead end — way too complicated and costly. It’s probably easier to find a "Pendulum" than to brew one.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata1_dialog_8"><text>So you do know a recipe?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata1_dialog_9"><text>There is something on the subject. Unverified information. And so far there’s been no chance to check it. But why did you even decide that a "Pendulum" would help you remember anything?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata1_dialog_10"><text>I had a conversation once... Anyway, it’s just a hypothesis. But I’d like to work this version through.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata1_dialog_11"><text>I suppose I’ll try to clarify what’s going on with the recipe, since you need it so badly. And at the same time I’ll think about what I’ll want from you in return. Let’s get back to this conversation later.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata1_dialog_12"><text>Alright. I’m here often, I’ll drop by from time to time.</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_0"><text>Anything new?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_1"><text>Looking for work? I’ve got a job just for you. That weapon prototype you recovered is completely out of charges. Turns out it runs on some kind of tricky battery. The energy cost for a single shot is enormous. How to rework that battery so the charge would last for at least ten shots — I have no idea.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_2"><text>Well, you’ve got plenty of smart guys around the Bar. Give it to them, let them rack their brains.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_3"><text>We already assembled a "council" of the local bright minds. Came up with nothing. But at least they pointed us to a scientist named Oganesyan, who’s holed up somewhere in the Swamps. He either studies, or used to study, low-energy systems.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_4"><text>So what’s the problem? Why did you say this job was specifically for me? Surely you’ve got someone of your own to send to chat with the nerds?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_5"><text>Can’t you guess? If not that many people know Fang was working on some unusual weapon, then the results of that work are known to only a handful. And you’re one of them. I’d prefer it to stay that way.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_6"><text>Got it. So I just need to ask the nerds in the Swamps about the possibility of improving the battery?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_7"><text>Roughly speaking, yes. More precisely, we want to find out whether it’s possible to increase the capacity so the charge would last, say, for about ten shots. That’s the first thing. The second: if it is, can production of such batteries be put on a conveyor, preferably entirely within the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_8"><text>I still haven’t heard what’s in it for me.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_9"><text>Remember our talk about "Pendulums" and the recipe? I made some inquiries, and here’s what turned up: "Pendulums" really do form in the "Labyrinth" anomaly, but with an extremely low probability, first of all. And secondly, you still have to manage to fish the artifact out of a solid field of "Bungees". But the probability can be significantly increased if you toss something into the center of the "Labyrinth" — a kind of "germ" of a future "Pendulum". Something of the same nature. How do you like that teaser?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_10"><text>I’d like some details. What kind of "germ" of the same nature? And most importantly — does the "Pendulum" really help bring memories back?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_11"><text>Hold your horses. I’ll sketch the big picture for you first, straight from the words of smart people. A "Pendulum" is like a conductor of psi-energy. And the "Labyrinth" is sort of an antenna. Standing with a "Pendulum" in the center of a "Labyrinth", you can send something like a mental query — don’t ask me to whom — and receive a response. In your case, for example, that could be returning memories. And that’s where the charity event called "free info" ends. We’ll talk about the rest when you complete my assignment.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_12"><text>So, you’re saying I should go to the nerds in the Swamps? Alright, I’ll give it a try.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_13"><text>Here’s the battery. You’ll figure out on the spot how to approach science. And don’t get fussy — if they ask for a favor in return, meet them halfway. Oh, and keep in mind, this battery is unique, so be careful with it.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata2_dialog_14"><text>One of a kind in the whole Zone, then? Better not lose it...</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_0"><text>I want to talk about the battery for Fang’s gun.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_1"><text>Have you already found out what I asked you?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_100"><text>No... I’m just reminding you so you don’t worry. Everything’s in progress, there’ll be results soon.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_200"><text>Yes. I found out a few things.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_201"><text>Report.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_2"><text>So, I handed the battery over to the nerd Oganesyan. He did some thinking, gave me what he called a “laboratory prototype” and sent me to the Foggy Thicket for a field test. I carried it out successfully. Long story short, skipping the extra details, everything seems to have worked, according to him, but there are some nuances. You’d better get in touch with him yourself now and discuss the details directly.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_3"><text>Hold on! The battery I gave you — did it stay with him? And I get nothing in return except your verbal “report”?!</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_4"><text>First of all, my “verbal report” comes with this paperwork from Oganesyan, with detailed explanations of who’s at fault and what needs to be done. Secondly, what result were you expecting? That they’d assemble a finished product for you there in five minutes and I’d deliver it? First, one experiment had to be conducted, which I helped with — for free, by the way. Now, as I understand it, a second one is needed. But we agreed that I’d just go to the Swamps to chat with the science types, not take a part-time job as a lab assistant. Bottom line, everything’s in the instructions. Decide for yourself who’s going to continue these experiments. I’m out.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_5"><text>Alright, let’s read what these instructions are about. So… laboratory prototype. Is that the one you carried into the thicket? Where is it?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_61"><text>It stayed there, in the Swamps…</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_62"><text>Here, barely managed to make it.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_71"><text>There’s also mention of an artifact called “Accumulator”. Did he give you one of those?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_72"><text>That’s just an ordinary starter battery, isn’t it? And it also mentions an artifact called “Accumulator”. Did he give you one of those?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_81"><text>No, of course not. Like someone would just hand me artifacts for nothing, yeah right.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_82"><text>Don’t pay attention to the casing. They used whatever was at hand. Basically, it’s just a container charged with anomalous energy. And I don’t have an artifact like that. Like someone would just hand me artifacts for nothing, yeah right.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_9"><text>Alright, we’ll consider the assignment completed. Here, this is for your efforts.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_10"><text>Thanks, of course, but what about the “Pendulums”? You promised to give me the details.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_11"><text>I don’t know the details. Wow, look how your face stretched right away. I warned you — the information is unverified. As for recalling certain episodes from the past with the help of this artifact — that part is solid. At least my… uh… scientific consultant considers it quite likely. But as for obtaining the artifact itself… I don’t know the recipe, but I can put you in touch with someone who does. Or thinks he does. The primary source, so to speak.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_12"><text>Well, Petrenko… you sly bastard. I’ve got no words.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_13"><text>Marked One, don’t strike a pose, alright? I gave you a working battery, and you screwed up. And instead of a clear result, you’re shunting me off to another guy who, on paper, suggests hauling some contraption God knows where, after first getting hold of a rare artifact. So as far as I’m concerned, we’re even.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_14"><text>Alright. Let’s drop it. So who is this mysterious bearer of “unverified” knowledge?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_15"><text>Brainiac Ilya. You know that stalker? He mostly hangs around somewhere in the Tesla Zone, and there happens to be a “Labyrinth” in those parts. I think he could well have gotten pretty good at unraveling the secrets of that anomaly.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mdata3_dialog_16"><text>Got it. A dead end, basically. If fate drags me into the Tesla Zone, and if Brainiac Ilya hasn’t kicked the bucket yet, I’ll ask him, sure. But I don’t really believe in a successful outcome.</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_0"><text>I dropped by to check how things are going here. Anything for me?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_1"><text>Marked One, maybe you’ll finally finish what you started? I mean the whole business with the battery and those experiments.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_2"><text>We already settled everything. You yourself said we were even.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_3"><text>That’s true. But I’m offering you a new job, even if it’s on the old topic. With separate payment, of course. You’ll choose for yourself from what I can offer. Ammo, grenades, or money, finally.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_4"><text>So what’s the job about?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_5"><text>Remember Oganesyan’s instructions, the scientist from the Swamps, the ones you brought? I want to finish his experiment… without involving outsiders. That’s why I’m offering it to you. If you refuse, I’ll understand, no hard feelings. I’ll find someone else eventually, but I really don’t want to bring an external contractor into the details of such a… delicate matter.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_6"><text>You’re always spinning secrets… If you were less secretive, it’d have been done long ago. Alright, let’s say I agree. What did the instructions say?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_71"><text>First, you need to go and retrieve the “laboratory prototype”. You said it was left in the Swamps. Second, we need the artifact “Accumulator”. In theory, with its help it’s possible to transform the anomalous energy, which this “battery” is currently saturated with, into the electrical kind we’re used to. But that will require certain manipulations.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_72"><text>First, we need that very “laboratory prototype”. I’ll provide it to you, of course. Second, we need the artifact “Accumulator”. In theory, with its help it’s possible to transform the anomalous energy, which this “battery” is currently saturated with, into the electrical kind we’re used to. But that will require certain manipulations.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_8"><text>What kind?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_9"><text>The battery together with the artifact must be taken to the “Tesla Zone” and left there for a short while near any “Electra” anomaly. The note says that after an hour or two the artifact should transmute, that is, change. That will be the indicator that the process is complete. After that, this damn thing will have to be hauled back to Oganesyan. How else are we supposed to make sure everything went right?!</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_101"><text>Yeah… I could’ve figured that out myself. Alright, I understand everything. Hand over the “Accumulator”.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_102"><text>Yeah… I could’ve figured that out myself. Alright, I understand everything. Hand over the battery and… uh… the other “Accumulator”.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_111"><text>There’s a snag. I don’t have that artifact. And I don’t know the recipe. Oganesyan is out of luck on that front too. Bottom line, you’ll have to get it somewhere on your own. I’ll compensate the expenses, don’t worry.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_112"><text>There’s a snag. I don’t have that artifact. And I don’t know the recipe. Oganesyan is out of luck on that front too. Bottom line, you’ll have to get it somewhere on your own. I’ll compensate the expenses, don’t worry. And the battery — here it is, stuff it into your backpack.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_12"><text>Every time I think that this time for sure the client won’t be able to surprise me with anything, something like this happens… Don’t tell me you’ll only pay if the experiment is successful.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_13"><text>Sounds tempting. Just kidding. It’ll be enough for me if the scientist confirms the very fact that the experiment was carried out and outlines the general prospects, if any appear, of course.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_dialog_14"><text>I’m already full of anticipation for the unforgettable impressions from carrying out this job. I only hope I’ll have enough patience not to throw this piece of junk into the nearest ditch in about twenty minutes.</text></string>
<string id="tex_tesla_accum_article"><text>Petrenko asks you to finish the experiment on charging the battery, a device assembled by the scientist Oganesyan from the Swamps. To do this, you need to drag the unit to the “Tesla Zone” and leave it near any “Electra” anomaly together with the similarly named artifact “Accumulator” for an hour or two. A variety of rewards of your choice is promised.</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_tesla_2_dialog_0"><text>Are you still interested in the experiment with the battery?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_2_dialog_1"><text>Of course. Everything worked out, I hope?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_2_dialog_2"><text>Uh-huh. I hauled the contraption over to Oganesyan in the Swamps. He spent quite a while expressing his delight, which is to say everything’s fine. I told him you’d be getting in touch with him soon, so the rest is up to you two.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_2_dialog_3"><text>Excellent, Marked One! I knew I could rely on you. I remember I promised compensation for the artifact, so here’s a check for a thousand greens right away.\nNow choose the main reward: I can give you about a hundred and fifty rounds for the SVD, or about ten VOGs and the same number of hand grenades. As another option — I can write you another check.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_2_dialog_41"><text>Sniper rounds wouldn’t go amiss.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_2_dialog_42"><text>I’ll take the VOGs and grenades.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_2_dialog_43"><text>Better give me another check, I’ve already got all that junk.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_2_dialog_5"><text>As you wish. Drop by if anything comes up.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_tesla_2_dialog_6"><text>I will, where would I go.</text></string>

<string id="zub_mdata1_dialog_0"><text>Do you know anything about the "Pendulums"?</text></string>
<string id="zub_mdata1_dialog_1"><text>A bit, but I’d like to know more. Want to hand over a "Pendulum" to me?</text></string>
<string id="zub_mdata1_dialog_2"><text>No. I want to know if there are recipes for them.</text></string>
<string id="zub_mdata1_dialog_3"><text>I’d like to know that too. I can offer a good price for a recipe.</text></string>
<string id="zub_mdata1_dialog_4"><text>I actually wanted to ask you. Thought you knew everything.</text></string>
<string id="zub_mdata1_dialog_5"><text>If I knew everything, there’d be no point in gathering information. Why bother, if you already know it all? So, are you selling the recipe, or are you just good at wagging your tongue?</text></string>
<string id="zub_mdata1_dialog_6"><text>I don’t have such a recipe.</text></string>

<string id="zub_mdata2_dialog_0"><text>I remember you saying you’d pay well for a "Pendulum" recipe.</text></string>
<string id="zub_mdata2_dialog_1"><text>You picked a fine time to ask. You’re too late, Marked One. I already know. You’re not the only smart one around.</text></string>
<string id="zub_mdata2_dialog_2"><text>So you don’t need it? What if my recipe is something special...</text></string>
<string id="zub_mdata2_dialog_3"><text>Don’t jack up the price and don’t play the expert. There are no special "Pendulum" recipes, they’re all the same. I’ve already found that out, and I’m not about to pay for the same thing a third time. Smartasses, honestly. So take that little piece of paper with your recipe and stick it... well, you know where.</text></string>
<string id="zub_mdata2_dialog_4"><text>And who told you the recipe?</text></string>
<string id="zub_mdata2_dialog_5"><text>I took a trip to the Monolith the other day and made a wish — to learn all the recipes.</text></string>
<string id="zub_mdata2_dialog_6"><text>Funny guy. Didn’t really want it that badly anyway...</text></string>

<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_0"><text>Do you know anything about Labyrinths?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_1"><text>Huh?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_2"><text>Kep from the Barrier said you mentioned something about it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_3"><text>What did I say? When? My head’s not working...</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_4"><text>Maybe you’ll knock back a shot to stimulate your memory?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_5"><text>Ah... yeah... that’s a good thing for straightening the head out. Alright then, you’re buying.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_6"><text>I don’t have any on me.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_7"><text>Sheesh... and here I was getting my hopes up...</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_71"><text>I’ll come back.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_8"><text>Alright, here you go, just don’t overdo it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_9"><text>Don’t worry about me... What about you? Not drinking? Suit yourself, we’re not proud, can drink alone. Ah! So... what were you saying there?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_10"><text>I’m saying, tell me about Labyrinths.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_11"><text>Well, what can I say... the guys went there. Ours... the ones who were looking for a way through the Thicket, to go around Duty.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_12"><text>Well...</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_13"><text>What do you mean, “well”? Haven’t gotten going yet... Hold on, I’ll pour some more.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_14"><text>You pour, just don’t forget the story.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_15"><text>Ah! So they walked there, walked and walked, and didn’t get anywhere. Couldn’t reach the center of the "Labyrinth", which means they didn’t find a passage between the "Bungees", and they didn’t have the sense to bring a "Springboard" with them. With that, they would’ve slipped through easy.\nAnyway! Night was coming on, time to head back. You know how time flies in the Foggy Thicket... I don’t drink as fast as time flies there... And how they even managed to remember something everyone had long forgotten...</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_151"><text>Remember what? Who?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_152"><text>Those guys... They hadn’t remembered it for a hundred years, and those lads who knew were long gone... And then suddenly, you see, they remembered. And it hit them right there in the head, they bolted at once and came running back... And then they start shaking me, who, what, how... Ah! All that’s in the past... Forget it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_153"><text>I don’t get it. They suddenly remembered something there, in the center of the "Labyrinth"?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_154"><text>You don’t need to get it, it’s none of your business... I told them too — there was nothing, I don’t know anything, they were stoned, or while they were getting tossed around near the center their brains just jammed up... They seemed to back off me... So you don’t ask either, there was nothing.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_16"><text>Alright. And why did they need to get to the center of the "Labyrinth" in the first place?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_17"><text>Huh? You don’t know or what? You can find special artifacts there... "Pendulums"... Or maybe you can’t find them... Maybe you have to brew them there.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_18"><text>Can you tell me more? Is there a recipe for these "Pendulums"? And what do you know about them in general?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_19"><text>I don’t know a damn thing... You think if I’m a cook, then I know all the recipes... No, I don’t know. I know how to cook borscht... entr?es... ca— cats. There. Out of cats... I know that too. But they said there’s supposedly a recipe... And I’ve never seen the "Pendulums" myself... Come on, don’t stall, pull out some more!</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_20"><text>Hold on! You’ll get loaded now and forget everything altogether... So do you know anything about recipes for these artifacts or not?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_21"><text>Some smart guy in the Bar seems to know... or maybe not in the Bar. What’s his name...</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_22"><text>Who?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_23"><text>Ah! I don’t know anyone there... They were saying they took the recipe from someone. Said there’s a guy... hangs around the nerds a lot...</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_24"><text>And why does he go to the nerds so often?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_25"><text>Well, probably turns in artifacts. What else for... Or maybe takes them from them and peddles them... I don’t really care...</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_26"><text>Yeah. No matter where you look, everything in the Zone revolves around that — just some cover it up with ideas, and others with science...</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_27"><text>What? Who? So why aren’t you pouring? That’s it, or what? You just teased me...</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_mdata_dialog_28"><text>That’s enough for you. There’s no more, and no point in getting you drunk... You don’t know anything about recipes or about the "Pendulums".</text></string>

<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_akk_dialog_0"><text>Ivan Sergeich, I was told you’re running some kind of experiments with energy here.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_akk_dialog_1"><text>You probably meant experiments... No. Our primary field is biology.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_akk_dialog_2"><text>And the secondary one?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_akk_dialog_3"><text>Well, that’s a classified topic... What exactly are you interested in?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_akk_dialog_4"><text>Well... someone asked me to look into it... Is anyone in the Swamps working with energetics, or whatever it’s called?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_akk_dialog_5"><text>Mmm... One group is conducting research in that area, not too far from here — in the western part of the Swamps. They have a field camp there.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_general_ecolog_akk_dialog_6"><text>Got it. I’ll drop by when I get the chance.</text></string>

<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_0"><text>You told me about the "Labyrinth" before, remember?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_11"><text>Yeah. There’s one here. There’s also a strange bubble hanging in the air in its center. Want to repeat Strelok’s path? I figured that out right away when you first asked about it. Wouldn’t recommend it...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_12"><text>I remember. Do you remember you promised to bring me some vodka? It’s dreary here...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_2"><text>Why? You said Strelok passed the "Labyrinth".</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_3"><text>I said Strelok might have tried to do it. But who knows how that venture turned out, if it even happened at all. And even if he did pass through it, where did the "Labyrinth" lead him? Where is he now? Neither among the living, nor among the dead. Neither with us, nor with THEM.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_4"><text>How do you know? Maybe he went in and came out on the other end of the Zone, or even beyond it.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_5"><text>I can sense it. I sense all of THEM, those who are already THERE. And he is neither here nor THERE...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_6"><text>A weighty argument, can’t argue with that. Alright then, I wanted to ask about something else. Petrenko — you know him? — told me you know how one can obtain the artifact "Pendulum" in one of the "Labyrinths".</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_7"><text>What pendulum-schmendulum? My soul is what’s penduluming, no peace for it...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_8"><text>What, you’ve got vodka for me? Nothing but drunks all around...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_9"><text>Not for drinking’s sake, I told you. I want a cure for my gloom. Come on, don’t be stingy. Put out at least five bottles.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_101"><text>I don’t have any vodka. Let’s manage without it somehow.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_102"><text>Here, take it, just don’t torment yourself. Hope this adds some sense to you.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_111"><text>Ah! You don’t understand... You can’t do without it here. It’s hard.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_112"><text>Now that’s more like it. Hold on, I’ll knock one back right away...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_121"><text>Damn you, I’ll bring you vodka. Wait.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_122"><text>Cheered up quick, I see? So what about the "Pendulum"?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_13"><text>They are produced exclusively by "Labyrinths", but very rarely. And yet there is one way to obtain a "Pendulum" with a guarantee. To do this, you need to lay out one of the special artifacts in the center of the anomaly, and then after the nearest blowout it will transform into an unusual capsule, inside which will be what you are looking for.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_14"><text>And which artifact needs to be laid out, what is it called?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_15"><text>I don’t know. As far as I know, they are all still nameless. The scientists only assigned them special numbers.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_16"><text>I think I get what you mean. Alright. You said the method is "guaranteed". So you’ve tested it yourself, I take it? Probably right here in this "Labyrinth"?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_17"><text>No, what are you talking about! Only fools go in there, you can’t get out. There are other "Labyrinths". In the thicket, and also closer to the center of the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_18"><text>So did you try it in the Foggy Thicket, or where?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_19"><text>I didn’t try it anywhere. But I know it’s true. I spoke with one of THEM. One of those who are on the OTHER side. That’s what he said.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_20"><text>Damn it all! And I almost bought it... Another dead end. Another Zone legend. Spirits whispered it to him, apparently...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_21"><text>You’re laughing for nothing. You go to the edge of "Tesla", if you’ve got the guts. There’s a bubble there. If you have the artifact "Compass" with you, you’ll be able to transfer with it to the OTHER side. Only then it won’t be funny anymore. Then you’ll see clearly, finding yourself among THEM...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_22"><text>Did the spirits whisper that to you too?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_23"><text>You’re all the same... Nobody listens to anyone, you interrupt each other, chatter nonstop. But you sit down, listen, feel the Zone. Don’t fuss, don’t chase loot, focus your attention on the wonders around you — and then THEY will speak to you themselves. But you’re always in a hurry, always late for something. For you there’s only your own “me” and your own “want”. Ask THEM what the Zone wants from you. From all of us...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_24"><text>Alright, alright... calm down. I’d sit here with you and talk to the spirits, but business still comes first. Another time. Anything else to add?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_25"><text>Even now, during our conversation, you keep rushing me. That’s why I forgot to add that there is another artifact suitable for the role of a future “embryo” — the "Boulder". And one more thing: don’t try to obtain more than one "Pendulum" at a time by throwing suitable artifacts into the "Labyrinth". Only one will ripen anyway.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_mayatnik_dialog_26"><text>An important addition, thanks. I’ll still have to try this method. At least to clear my conscience and to finally close the question of the "Pendulums". That’s it, Ilyukha, keep talking to the spirits, and it’s time for me to go.</text></string>

<string id="klyk_remember_text"><text>Someone was carrying someone out of a dangerous place... It’s unclear who and where. But Fang was there!</text></string>
<!-- äîáàâëåíî igor.doc -->
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_0"><text>So you’re still sitting here?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_1"><text>Well, yes. We’re analyzing, deriving statistical data... working, in short. How about you? The artifact I gave you — did you manage to transform it? Were my calculations confirmed?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_21"><text>I haven’t really had the time yet. And going back into that place again is kind of scary. Maybe I’ll try later.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_22"><text>Yeah. That’s why I came — to tell you. I managed to turn that "Soul" into cash.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_3"><text>Really?! That means my calculations were correct! Of course, it would be good to have several control transformations for the sake of completeness, but even a single confirmation is already a breakthrough! Marked One, you have no idea how great you are! Where is it, the artifact?! Show me what you ended up with.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_41"><text>Where, where... It’s locked up. Waiting for its owner.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_42"><text>I can show it, but so what?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_51"><text>Be sure to bring it, this is very important! We need to run an analysis urgently! And, Marked One, I’ll try not to remain in your debt.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_52"><text>What do you mean, “so what”?! If this really is an artifact with entirely positive characteristics, then some research must be conducted. To determine whether the structure of the artifact has changed, or whether it has simply altered its properties. How stable its current, new properties are, and how long they can persist. If you’re interested, then I gave you an artifact that was, how should I put it... “cooked”, not a natural one.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_61"><text>I’ll think about it... It wasn’t easy for me to get it.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_62"><text>And do you know how to tell a “cooked” artifact from one found in the field? And what difference does it even make?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_7"><text>Let’s say I have a hypothesis on that matter. In fact, our experiment with you is precisely meant to help me move in that direction. This is the first such phenomenon in my, and indeed in scientific practice in general. So, what do you say? Shall we make a deal?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_8"><text>A phenomenon, you say... Then the reward should be appropriate. I’ll say right away — I’m not interested in what Pakhom changes.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_9"><text>There is a very rare modifier recipe, discovered quite recently. Previously it was almost unknown in the stalker community. Have you heard of the modifier "Tears of the Giant"?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_10"><text>Hm... Even those cry?! You’ve convinced me, take the artifact, study it.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_11"><text>Thank you, Marked One. You won’t regret it, be sure of that. The properties of this modifier will please you. Write it down.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_new_theme_3_dialog_12"><text>See you, science... I’ll go enjoy myself.</text></string>

<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_0"><text>I’ve got something to talk about.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_1"><text>What did you want?</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_21"><text>I wanted to ask about that strange guy from your story... You remember the talk about the blowout, the anti-telepathy artifact?</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_22"><text>You seemed to know Fang, right? At the Bar they told me a few things about him. And about how you used to go places on his errands.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_31"><text>Yeah.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_32"><text>So?</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_41"><text>Could it have been Fang, by any chance? At the Bar they told me a few things about him. And about how you used to go places on his errands.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_51"><text>Let’s say it was Fang. So what?</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_6"><text>The thing is, I’m trying to piece together a complete picture from scattered fragments of information. You know I’m looking for Strelok. Fang was one of his associates and built various gadgets for him, including some kind of unusual weapon. As I understand it, he obtained parts for this weapon in different places. For example, at the Bar, through Prapor, who at the time was in charge of Duty’s warehouses. And you helped him with that. Correct me if I’m wrong somewhere.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_7"><text>That’s all correct. I see you’re not wasting your time. I just don’t get what you’re getting at.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_8"><text>I already said my main goal is to find Strelok. That’s why I’m gathering any information related to him, looking for any traces and leads. Tell me about Fang.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_9"><text>Well, he seems to have disappeared several months ago. There are rumors he died. So I don’t know how useful my story will be to you, but... alright, listen.\nWe’d known each other for a long time. Not close friends, but we met often, drank together, naturally. He was a tech genius, as they say, God-gifted. He could literally cobble together all sorts of useful things from junk and scraps, on the fly. He knew weapons inside out. He and old Vergas often had arguments about that, sometimes to the point of shouting. And in general, he helped many stalkers with technical matters. That’s why he was respected.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_10"><text>By the way, about weapons. The very one you helped Fang get parts for — can you tell me anything about it?</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_11"><text>I never saw it myself. I don’t even know if he finished it. The last time I talked to Fang, he said there was still a lot to be refined.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_12"><text>Alright. And have you heard anything about the so-called group of Strelok? Maybe Fang told you about it?</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_13"><text>No, Fang didn’t talk much about their group. I know that besides Strelok himself and Fang, there was Ghost in it. And Doctor also had dealings with them, apparently. Well, you know Doc yourself. Fang was their tech guy and handled supplies. Or maybe he was just running errands, I didn’t really dig into it. Fang and Doctor showed up on the Cordon often, while the other two stayed in the shadows all the time...</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_14"><text>Listen, why didn’t you tell me all this earlier, if you knew I was interested in Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_15"><text>You didn’t ask about Fang or their group. And Strelok... well, who knows who else he was friends with in the Zone. In any case, I didn’t know him personally.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_16"><text>Alright. Did Fang ever share any thoughts with you about Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_17"><text>Just a little. He said that Strelok himself was a big mystery to him. No one knows where he’s from, how old he is, or who he was before he became a stalker. For a newcomer to the Zone, he turned out to be remarkably nimble and lucky. By the way, just like you, Marked One... I think he was an extraordinary person if he managed to put together a group of such different, dissimilar people. I don’t know what bound them all together, but Strelok was definitely calling the shots. One former Clear Sky member said that at one point they were all holed up in the Swamps. Until the leadership of "Clear Sky" suddenly decided that Strelok and his associates were somehow disrupting the established order in the Zone, upsetting some kind of balance. Later there were even rumors that Strelok decided to shut the Zone down as a phenomenon. That completely ruined their relations.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_18"><text>How’s that? The Zone isn’t a tavern where they pour bootleg vodka. How can you “shut it down”?</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_19"><text>I have no idea. If you hadn’t noticed, nothing happened to the Zone, so... Be that as it may, Clear Sky vanished almost completely, unlike Strelok and his company.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_20"><text>Uh-huh, I’ve heard something like that in passing. And what did Strelok’s people do after that?</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_210"><text>I think only Strelok himself knew exactly what the group was up to. Once Fang let slip that they were planning something big. It seems they managed to dig up something serious. They dug deep, almost reaching the very center of the Zone. Since, as you know, the surface route is blocked by the Brain Scorcher, I didn’t understand how they got through. But Fang didn’t know the details; he didn’t take part in those raids.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_220"><text>So what did they dig up there?! Alright. You said Doctor and Fang often appeared on the Cordon. Doc is clear enough. But what was Fang doing there?</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_230"><text>Mainly running back and forth to Sidor, stocking up on things from him. He dropped by Vergas to chat too, but I already mentioned that. Sometimes he’d just sit by the campfire with the youngsters, enlightening and instructing them.</text></string>
<string id="volk_klyk_dialog_240"><text>So, Sidorovich and Vergas. I shouldn’t forget to question them as well. Thanks, Wolf. I’m off.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_klyk_dialog_0"><text>Sidorovich, do you know a stalker by the nickname Fang?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_klyk_dialog_1"><text>The handyman one? Yeah, I know him. Hasn’t shown up around here in a long while, if that’s what you’re asking.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_klyk_dialog_2"><text>No, I wanted to ask something else. I know he used to drop by your place often. Can you tell me why?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_klyk_dialog_3"><text>Ordered various parts through me—spare parts, components, documentation and manuals for them. What exactly—that’s none of your business. Trade secret. Mind your own business.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_klyk_dialog_4"><text>To hell with the spare parts. What do you know about Fang’s ties with Strelok and some guy called Ghost?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_klyk_dialog_5"><text>I don’t know anything. Me and Fang talked business, not heart-to-heart chats. And you, Marked One, that’s enough chatter. You looking to buy or sell? No? Then don’t block the light.</text></string>

<string id="vergas_klyk_dialog_0"><text>Vergas, do you know Fang?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klyk_dialog_1"><text>Knew him. Stubborn as a mule, that guy was. Once he started arguing about weapons, that was it—might as well call the saints. Ah, well... Speak either good of the dead or nothing at all.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klyk_dialog_2"><text>Funny, where did the rumor that Fang is dead even come from? Tell me, Vergas, did you personally see his body?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klyk_dialog_3"><text>No, but I know well the one who saw his grave. That’s how I found out. And I’ve got no reason not to trust that man.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klyk_dialog_4"><text>Oh really? And where is Fang’s grave?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klyk_dialog_5"><text>Somewhere in the Red Forest. Why are you asking?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klyk_dialog_6"><text>I’m looking for his... associate, a stalker called Strelok. Didn’t Fang ever mention him to you?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klyk_dialog_7"><text>No. Don’t recall.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klyk_dialog_8"><text>Shame. Looks like that lead just ran dry.</text></string>

<string id="prapor_klyk_1_dialog_0"><text>Listen, I’ve been meaning to ask you for a while—why is it that every time we meet you keep spouting some kind of nonsense? No offense, but what’s with all the secrets and half-answers?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_klyk_1_dialog_1"><text>You’re awfully curious, Marked One. That’s not always good for your health, you know.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_klyk_1_dialog_2"><text>Come on, cut it out, alright? You know I’m looking for Strelok. Petrenko told me you knew his right-hand man, Fang. That true?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_klyk_1_dialog_3"><text>What “true”? True that I knew him, or true that Petrenko told you?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_klyk_1_dialog_4"><text>You’re not easy to deal with. I’m asking you man to man: if you know anything about Strelok or Fang, please tell me.</text></string>
<string id="prapor_klyk_1_dialog_5"><text>Man to man? And you’re sure you’re a man?</text></string>
<string id="prapor_klyk_1_dialog_6"><text>Oh, that’s it. Maybe I’ll come back some other time, when you’re in a better mood.</text></string>

<string id="barman_klyk_dialog_0"><text>There’s a guy hanging around the Bar, kind of disgruntled. They call him Prapor.</text></string>
<string id="barman_klyk_dialog_1"><text>Disgruntled—that’s for sure.</text></string>
<string id="barman_klyk_dialog_2"><text>Why’s he always grumbling? Can’t even have a proper talk with him.</text></string>
<string id="barman_klyk_dialog_3"><text>Marked One, if I weren’t running the Bar, and if their leadership wasn’t hanging around here, I’d talk about it. But as it stands—go ask the stalkers for gossip. Those blabbermouths don’t care, but I’m not in a position to spread rumors. Clear? You buying something—I’ll sell, that’s what I’m here for. But wagging my tongue isn’t my specialty.</text></string>

<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_0"><text>Tell me about a Duty member. They call him Prapor.</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_1"><text>Yeah, there’s one. Commands the Duty checkpoint at the Garbage. Always whining about his ailments.</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_2"><text>Not that one—the other. Hangs around the Bar, also supposedly Prapor—same last name or something.</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_3"><text>Ah... that one. There was a story with him. I can share—if you’ve got something to wet my throat with.</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_4"><text>Got it, I’ll bring some.</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_5"><text>Alright, I’ll pour.</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_6"><text>That’s the way. Well then! To Prapor and his promotion.</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_7"><text>Promotion?</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_8"><text>For a time Prapor was in charge of ammo, weapons, food and other supplies. Sort of the quartermaster for Duty. Or “logistics officer,” if you want to sound fancy. You didn’t think Petrenko had been running the stock all his life, did you?</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_9"><text>Honestly, I never really thought about it. So what happened next?</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_10"><text>These days Prapor’s out of the loop. They didn’t kick him out—Duty still needs people—but they booted him from the post. They say Petrenko edged him out himself... or at least set the whole thing in motion.</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_11"><text>Booted him for what?</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_12"><text>What for? Embezzlement, as they say—on a particularly large scale. Valuable Duty property. Caught him red-handed. The brass probably knew about the scheme for a while, but they wanted him with the evidence in hand. Duty’s full of former cops, wherever you look. Still got their cop habits.\nThere was this stalker—a jack-of-all-trades—Fang. Back then Prapor passed him something extremely valuable. Or was about to, but didn’t get the chance. That I don’t know. Fang eventually laid low, stopped coming around here. Duty started digging and found out Prapor had done deals with him more than once.</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_13"><text>And what was so valuable that Fang was getting through Prapor?</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_14"><text>How should I know? But their business was well set up—that’s for sure. To the point where Fang sometimes sent other stalkers in his place, probably so he wouldn’t draw too much attention.\nAnyway, now Petrenko runs everything. Between us—he trades in property too, but it’s small stuff compared to Prapor. And some things he’s officially allowed to sell and trade with stalkers. Still, you can often arrange something special under the counter...</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_141"><text>Alright... What about the stalkers Fang sent to pick up goods—do you know any of them?</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_142"><text>Not really... Maybe just Wolf. Saw him here once with Fang. They were standing with Prapor, hashing something out. Later Wolf dropped by his storeroom a few times on his own.</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_15"><text>Oh really? And what does Prapor even do now?</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_16"><text>Loafs around. Walks about puffing up his cheeks. They removed him, but still haven’t given him a new post. They wouldn’t drum him out anyway. Heard one of the senior officers stood up for him. And during the investigation Prapor talked his way out of it—said he was helping out selflessly, claimed he got nothing from Fang and was acting for the good of Duty. Kept insisting Fang was crafting some special weapon that would help Duty win a decisive victory over the spawn of the Zone... and so on. They also say Prapor’s practically on buddy-buddy terms with Voronin himself. So you figure it out.</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_17"><text>Did Fang really craft something for Prapor?</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_18"><text>Who knows? Sounds more like a scam, though... anything’s possible. You’d be better off staying out of their business. That whole bunch of “ideological comrades” is really a jar of spiders. Duty’ll fall apart one day, mark my words. They’ll eat each other alive.</text></string>
<string id="prut_klyk_dialog_19"><text>Whether it falls apart or not—I don’t really care. I’ve got my own problems to sort out. I’ll try to question Wolf about this whole story when I get the chance.</text></string>

<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_0"><text>So how are you holding up here?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_1"><text>Ah, you know... Worse than it was, but better than it’ll be. I’m sick of hanging around here. What do you think, will I ever get out of here at all?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_2"><text>I’m sure you will. Just be patient...\nI wanted to ask you something. They told me at the Bar that you were working on some unusual weapon.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_3"><text>I’ve worked on all sorts of things. Weapons too. Fixed up a TOZ for one guy, a Kalash for another—you can’t even remember it all.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_4"><text>This one was special. Supposedly a prototype, a demonstration model.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_5"><text>Ah! There was one, yeah. But I never finished it. I was working from Strelok’s blueprints. No idea where he even got them... I told him it wouldn’t be able to fire. Where was I supposed to find that kind of charge? And he goes: don’t worry, the charge isn’t your problem—just build the thing itself. So I did my best.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_6"><text>Did you try firing it?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_7"><text>I did. Strelok brought a couple of strange batteries to test it with. Said he couldn’t get more yet, that he was missing some special substance. I thought he was joking, pulling my leg. I loaded it, aimed at a rock—and when it went off, it blasted that rock to pieces. A fragment nearly smacked me in the head. I told him he could’ve warned me, I’d have stepped back. And he just scratched his head and said there was a slight miscalculation. Said it needed a bit of redesign.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_8"><text>Redesign what, the battery?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_9"><text>No, the construction itself—focus the beam more.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_10"><text>Did you redesign it?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_11"><text>Yeah. But I didn’t test it again. Figured to hell with it, let him fire it himself. Maybe he miscalculated again and I’d end up losing an arm for good.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_12"><text>And where is this weapon now?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_13"><text>What weapon? It was just another one of Strelok’s experiments. You were right—it’s a prototype.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_14"><text>Prototype or not. Where is it?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_15"><text>I left it in a stash, in the Foggy Thicket. There’s a secret little cave under the lake there. I used to keep some things there, and it protects from emissions too. Later I went to check the stash, and the gun was gone... I looked for it—couldn’t find it. Must’ve dropped it somewhere around there while sorting through my junk.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_16"><text>And how did Strelok react to it going missing?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_17"><text>Not at all. His head’s always full of ideas. He probably already forgot about the piece. Or decided to come up with something else, something better. I remember he was poring over a list of new parts for a long time—all for his experiments.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_gun_dialog_18"><text>Got it. I’ll try to find your cave under the lake and search around there. Don’t lose heart, Fang. It’ll all work out, you’ll see.</text></string>

<string id="saharov_klyk_2_dialog_0"><text>Professor, I meant to tell you. You gave me that helmet for Fang, remember?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_2_dialog_1"><text>Yes, of course. No transmission from Agroprom ever followed. I had begun to think our patient had perished and that you had abandoned the matter. So what of him—when will you deliver him?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_2_dialog_2"><text>I didn’t abandon it, and I gave him the helmet. It’s just that he didn’t go to the surface, he went... somewhere else.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_2_dialog_3"><text>Somewhere else? Why? How could you—ruin such an experiment! Did you consider what will happen to him now?! I still receive no signal from the helmet—he has surely already perished.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_2_dialog_4"><text>He should be fine, I think. And your helmet... well, the electronics glitch a bit in that place...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_2_dialog_5"><text>So the helmet isn’t functioning either? That’s even worse! And I had such hopes for you...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_2_dialog_6"><text>I didn’t really think about that at the time... But Fang isn’t on the surface yet anyway.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_2_dialog_7"><text>Exactly—you didn’t think! Ah, such a unique... no matter—you’ve disrupted all the plans.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_2_dialog_8"><text>Why are you taking this so hard, Professor? Fang is still alive. He must be alive... And thank God for that. We’ll think of something.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_2_dialog_9"><text>Yes, I’m a bit on edge, forgive me... Very well, I shall report the failure and write it off. There are more important matters to attend to.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_2_dialog_10"><text>Write what off? Whom?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_2_dialog_11"><text>The helmet will be written off as a lost asset. That is all. The matter is closed.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_2_dialog_12"><text>Alright then...</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="doctor_klyk_dialog_0"><text>Doctor, I wanted to tell you about Fang.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_klyk_dialog_1"><text>Any new information?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_klyk_dialog_2"><text>I contacted Sakharov and he made a special helmet. Fang told me you had plans to settle him somewhere here, but you were afraid to send him through a teleporter.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_klyk_dialog_3"><text>Yes. He probably would not have made it without protection. What about the helmet? Did you give it to Fang, and did he come out at Agroprom?</text></string>
<string id="doctor_klyk_dialog_4"><text>I gave him that helmet and the "Compass" you left. He teleported here. The helmet protected him.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_klyk_dialog_5"><text>Here? To the Thicket? That's good. I've wanted that for a long time.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_klyk_dialog_6"><text>He said he knows that cave by touch and can make it from the teleporter to his shelter. He'll stay there and wait.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_klyk_dialog_7"><text>Good, I will definitely visit him. I think everything will be fine. At least he feels at home here; he spent a lot of time in that cave. It's much more convenient for me too, and I will do everything I can. Let us hope for a speedy recovery, since time moves faster here. I will try to find one person. He is a real specialist and will definitely help. And you did everything you could.</text></string>
<string id="doctor_klyk_dialog_8"><text>I hope so... Now all Fang can do is wait and hope.</text></string>

<string id="agr_klyk_doc_visit_dialog_0"><text>Fang, what happened? And where did Doctor go?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_doc_visit_dialog_1"><text>You tripped the booby trap you told me to set myself. Forgot about it? You're lucky shrapnel did not tear you up, only stunned you. Doctor was here a long time ago. He left you a note somewhere around here, make sure you read it.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_doc_visit_dialog_21"><text>I read the note. Tell me, why did Doctor run off so fast? Or was I out for too long?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_doc_visit_dialog_22"><text>I'll read it. But answer me first: why did Doctor run off so fast? Or was I out for too long?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_doc_visit_dialog_3"><text>Not long, a couple of minutes maybe. I was about to come over to you, then I heard you moving. I got stunned a bit myself; I did not expect anyone to crawl in here. Doctor always comes in by teleporter, and nobody else ever comes here. Except you, you've been dropping by more often lately.\nDoctor's last visit was about two days ago. He said he brought me a "Compass." As I understand it, it can move you through the bubble to the cave under the lake in the Foggy Thicket. I know that cave, I used to have a spot set up there.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_doc_visit_dialog_4"><text>Wait. So Doctor was not here when I blacked out? I do not get it...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_doc_visit_dialog_5"><text>I am the one who does not get you... Did you just see Doctor here? Are you sure you were not concussed? Double vision, nausea? Hit your head when you fell? Concussions are tricky, you can start seeing things...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_doc_visit_dialog_6"><text>I am not sure... maybe I imagined it, you're right. So you are saying Doctor was here two days ago?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_doc_visit_dialog_7"><text>Well... It's hard to track time in this place, but around that. I told him I asked you to contact Sakharov so he could come up with some kind of protection. So he left me the artifact, and in case you came by again, a note for you. Doctor thinks if they can build protection for my brain, it should also help with teleport travel...\nAnd I completely forgot about the booby trap. I did not think about how you would crawl in here yourself, otherwise I would have told Doc to remove it.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_doc_visit_dialog_81"><text>So for some reason Doctor thinks it is better to move you to the Thicket, not to Sakharov? But he did not say that directly in the note. Strange. Maybe he just did not want to take responsibility if something goes wrong...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_doc_visit_dialog_82"><text>So for some reason Doctor thinks it is better to move you to the Thicket, not to Sakharov? I should probably read the note first.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_doc_visit_dialog_9"><text>I do not even know what to say... It is up to you, Marked One, what to do with all this. Just please do it soon, I have no strength left... How much longer do I have to rot in here?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_doc_visit_dialog_10"><text>Wait a bit, I need to think it all over again.</text></string>

<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_0"><text>Fang, time to get you out of here.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_1"><text>Finally! What is your plan?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_21"><text>Sakharov gave me a special helmet. Says it will shield the radiation... And you will be able to move safely to the Foggy Thicket through the teleporter in the corner of the room.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_22"><text>Sakharov gave me a special helmet. Says it will shield the radiation... And you will be able to move safely to the Foggy Thicket through the teleporter in the corner of the room. So... where did I... Hold on, I must have dropped it.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_3"><text>I just hope the "Compass" Doctor left me is tuned right. I would hate to end up who knows where...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_4"><text>Do not sweat it, it will be fine. Here is the helmet, put it on. You said you have a set-up spot in the cave under the lake, you'll stay there for now. I think Doc will visit you soon. Maybe I will drop by too.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_5"><text>I'd like to believe that... Otherwise where am I supposed to go in the forest when I cannot see?! But in that cave I know every way in and out by touch. All right. Hope we meet again. You still remind me of someone. Your voice, the way you talk, your intonation. I wish I could see you with my own eyes... Take care.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_6"><text>Wait! I wanted to ask one more thing. What do you know about the Monolith? And what does it mean that "it's an illusion"? I... well, while I was out, I seemed to hear Doctor say that.</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_7"><text>About the Monolith? There was a legend that it was a special artifact that grants wishes. I think Strelok believed it was not a legend and looked for a way to reach it. But I do not really know much about that. Seems Strelok and Ghost met some scientist and discussed it, but I do not know what came of it.\nOh, and one more thing I remembered: shortly before I got hit, Strelok asked me to think about how to crack the coded locks on bunker doors you sometimes find in the Zone. I did not dig into it then, no time, and he was in a hurry somewhere. He also asked me to find a decent computer. Said we would figure it out together and think how to make a decoder. He mentioned some labs too. I think he wanted to use them to make a quick push north, maybe to that Monolith...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_8"><text>I do not get it, how is that even possible? What labs?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_9"><text>I did not get him then either. Strelok and Ghost were always crazy, showing up out of nowhere and then vanishing on another raid. So anyway, one day Strelok barged in after another run saying, "This is our chance!" Looks like he found something. Later Ghost kept swearing that day they barely got away from the mercs. Then he questioned me, asked whether Strelok gave me anything, and if so what exactly... I told him Strelok gave me nothing useful, just instructions. So I do not know what labs he meant...</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_10"><text>And what happened then?</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_11"><text>Nothing. I went to the Valley on his errand, and on the way back I got hit... Find Ghost or that scientist they met, you'll learn more. I just cannot remember the scientist's name.\nWell, I should go. Stay healthy, friend!</text></string>
<string id="agr_klyk_last_dialog_12"><text>Same to you.</text></string>

<string id="aver_klyk_start_dialog_101"><text>Who is that? Doctor?</text></string>
<string id="aver_klyk_start_dialog_102"><text>Fang! It's me, Marked One. Glad you're alive. How are you?</text></string>
<string id="aver_klyk_start_dialog_103"><text>Could be better... Good thing at least you stopped by. Doctor has not shown up for some reason. I keep wondering, maybe we were wrong to refuse help from the scientists?</text></string>
<string id="aver_klyk_start_dialog_104"><text>The scientists are not going anywhere. If needed, we'll contact them too. And Doctor will come, no doubt. Wait.</text></string>
<string id="aver_klyk_start_dialog_105"><text>Fine, he comes, then what? He'll take me to the hut?</text></string>
<string id="aver_klyk_start_dialog_106"><text>Not yet... You see, the helmet probably won't work here, in the Thicket. It already did its job, it protected you during teleportation. But we'll come up with something, we have to. The main thing is you are alive, you can talk... and all that.</text></string>
<string id="aver_klyk_start_dialog_107"><text>Some life... Still, better than a coffin, no arguing with that.</text></string>
<string id="aver_klyk_start_dialog_108"><text>Keep your hope up, we will find a solution.</text></string>
<string id="aver_klyk_start_dialog_109"><text>That's all I can do. Thanks, Marked One. Come by, do not forget me.</text></string>
<string id="aver_klyk_start_dialog_110"><text>I will come again, of course.</text></string>
<string id="aver_klyk_start_dialog_201"><text>Who is that? Doctor?</text></string>
<string id="aver_klyk_start_dialog_202"><text>No. It's me, Marked One. How are you holding up here?</text></string>
<string id="aver_klyk_start_dialog_203"><text>I'm fine. Just sitting here...</text></string>

<string id="klyk_remember_dialog_0"><text>Fang, I remembered something...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_remember_dialog_1"><text>Yeah? Well, congratulations. What did you remember?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_remember_dialog_2"><text>Voices. They sounded distant, like through cotton. As if the one hearing them was concussed or... barely conscious. There were two people talking. One of them called the other "Fang."</text></string>
<string id="klyk_remember_dialog_3"><text>Oh really? And what were those "voices" saying?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_remember_dialog_4"><text>One of them was urging Fang not to leave some third person behind. The other argued an emission was coming and they would not make it with that burden. I think they were talking about me, and by the feel of it, it happened here, in the Foggy Thicket. Can you tell me about that incident, if it really happened and was not just a dream or a hallucination?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_remember_dialog_5"><text>Hmm... there was something like that once, but I do not think that guy we carried was you. Then again, how else would that memory surface for you...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_remember_dialog_6"><text>Tell it from the beginning, and we'll sort it out.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_remember_dialog_7"><text>All right. Just keep in mind my own head is still foggy, so I might easily mix up events or details.\nAnyway, for a while Strelok got into running experiments in the Foggy Thicket. First he asked me to find a place here for a camp. I found a roomy cave, and he set it up like a workshop with a storage room. I hauled all kinds of parts there for him, and I made some things myself from his blueprints. There was all kinds of stuff there... As for why he needed any of it, hell if I know.\nSo, about that incident... It happened near the "dead Monolith." That is what Strelok called a big rock not far from the hut...</text></string>
<!-- äàëüøå èäóò äóáëè ñòðîê èç klyk_prizrak_dialog, íà÷èíàÿ îò 101 è äî 161 + 181 + 191 -->
<string id="klyk_remember_dialog_15"><text>To be honest, I am not fully convinced it was you. I do not know where that memory came from. Maybe the Zone wind brought you scraps of someone else's memory?! I cannot see you, but you understand... that stalker was almost a corpse, or like a twisted zombie.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_remember_dialog_18"><text>I am about to break my own brain trying to figure this out. Still, some things got clearer either way. Thanks.</text></string>

<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_0"><text>Listen, Fang, I need a serious talk with you.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_1"><text>Serious? So everything really was for nothing... no helping me now, right?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_2"><text>No, I mean something else. I met Ghost, and he told me... I do not even know what. Like Ivar brought me to Strelok, like Doctor knew a lot about me from the very beginning. And that Strelok needed me... as some kind of test subject. Is that true?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_3"><text>I know almost nothing about Ivar, and even less about his dealings with Strelok. Strelok was always playing his own game, I told you that already. He shared plans only when he needed you to know. Even then, he could hold things back or feed half-truths. Otherwise you could not squeeze an extra word out of him.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_4"><text>Fine. Then what about me?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_5"><text>How would I know what was with you... We first met in the underground under Agroprom, remember?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_6"><text>But even then you said my voice reminded you of someone...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_7"><text>I did. When you cannot see, your mind paints all sorts of things. You keep hoping it is someone familiar talking to you, some friend. Someone who will help.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_8"><text>I know in broad strokes that Strelok ran experiments here in the Thicket. Can you tell me any details?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_91"><text>I found a roomy cave here once, and Strelok set it up like a workshop with a storage room. I hauled all kinds of parts there for him, and I made some things myself from his blueprints. There was all kinds of stuff there... Why he needed it, hell if I know.\nAh! I remember one incident... It happened near the "dead Monolith." That is what Strelok called a big rock not far from the hut...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_92"><text>We already talked about this. About your "memory" and that guy, maybe hit by radiation, maybe something else...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_101"><text>Well? What happened there?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_102"><text>No, that man was definitely me. If you compare everything Doctor and others told me... yes, it all fits. The only thing unclear is whether Strelok did something to me there on purpose or not. And why he told no one his plans about me. No one, not even his closest comrades. I do not understand...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_111"><text>Another experiment was planned, but one of the blocks shorted out and burned the battery. Happens all the time in the Thicket. So I ran for a spare. When I came back, Strelok was arguing with Ghost about something, and next to them was the body of some man, looked like a stalker...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_112"><text>Hey, Marked One! You still here? Are you talking to me or thinking out loud?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_121"><text>Who was that and where did he come from? Did they explain anything at all?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_122"><text>What? Yeah, sorry... thinking out loud. All right, let's set that aside for now. Listen, Doctor told me Strelok wanted to reach the Monolith to destroy it. Seems he ran experiments here specifically to test whether that was possible. Do you happen to know if he made any progress?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_131"><text>Progress? Hardly. Strelok ordered us to haul that body to Doctor's hut immediately. And an emission was building, no time for talk. I do not even know why Strelok fussed over him so much... The guy looked like a corpse. Barely alive, he would not have survived the emission anyway...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_132"><text>Destroy the Monolith? Is that some kind of joke? Even if it really exists, how do you imagine doing that? Strelok spent so much time near the "dead Monolith," tinkering with something, blasting it with strange equipment, even shooting at it with some odd gun, like in sci-fi movies. Where did he even get that?! Some secret tech or what? And nothing. The rock is still standing. And you're talking about destroying the Monolith...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_141"><text>But you did carry him to Doctor, right?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_142"><text>A movie-style gun, huh? Interesting. I think I have seen something like that before.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_151"><text>We carried him to the hut, yes. Strelok immediately rushed off on his own business, told us to watch the stalker, and we stayed to wait out the emission. Doc examined the poor bastard, injected something, waved some strange artifact over his head... I got the impression he'd been hit by psi-radiation or something like that. Then after the emission ended, Doc said we had to move the man to the shelter under Agroprom. Supposedly you recover from psi-shocks better closer to the perimeter.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_152"><text>I remember someone saying the fanatics in Pripyat also have some kind of superweapon. Could that be where this came from? I would not be surprised if Strelok found a way in with them and they traded him that "blaster" for... I do not know, some rare artifact maybe?!</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_161"><text>So I owe my life to you and Ghost. First you carried me to Doctor, then to Agroprom...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_162"><text>Last question. Did Strelok or Ghost ever talk in front of you about the "Black Mark," transferring consciousness, a psychomatrix, or anything like that?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_171"><text>What? No... I doubt it was you. I cannot see you, but that stalker was almost a corpse, you understand, like a twisted zombie.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_172"><text>You say strange things, Marked One. First the Monolith, now some matrix. I know nothing about that, and nobody talked about anything like it in front of me.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_181"><text>And still. I almost have no doubts left. Dig into your memory again: Strelok definitely never said why he might need me? Maybe even a hint...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_182"><text>All right, Fang, take care. Or maybe goodbye. I am not sure we'll meet again...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_191"><text>Nope. The only thing I figured out is this stalker... or you... anyway, he mattered to Strelok for some reason, and alive. Ghost kept breaking his head over that too.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_192"><text>Good luck, friend. So, have they finally decided what is going to happen with me?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_prizrak_dialog_20"><text>Everything will be fine. Doctor will figure out how to help you. And Ivar, I hope, will drop by soon. Two heads are better than one.</text></string>

<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_0"><text>I wanted to ask you something. They told me at the Bar you made some unusual weapon.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_1"><text>I made all kinds of things. Weapons too. Tuned one guy's TOZ, another guy's Kalash, you cannot remember it all.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_2"><text>This was a special weapon. A prototype, some kind of demo model.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_3"><text>Ah, that one, yes. I never finished it though. I worked from Strelok's blueprints. Where he even got them... I told him it would never fire. Where was I supposed to find that kind of charge? And he told me: do not worry, charge is not your problem, just build the hardware itself. So I did my best.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_4"><text>Did you try firing it?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_5"><text>I did. Strelok brought a pair of strange batteries for testing. Said he could not get more yet, he was missing some special substance. I thought he was joking, messing with me. I loaded it, aimed at a rock, and boom, the rock shattered. Shrapnel almost hit me in the head. I told him he could have warned me, I would have stood farther away. He scratched his head and said there was a calculation error. Needed a little redesign, he said.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_6"><text>Redesign what, the battery?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_7"><text>No, the hardware itself, focus the beam more.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_8"><text>Did you redesign it?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_9"><text>Yep. But I did not test it again. Thought to hell with it, let him shoot it himself. Maybe he miscalculated again, and this time I'd lose an arm.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_10"><text>So where is that weapon now?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_11"><text>What weapon? It is just another Strelok experiment. You were right: a prototype.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_12"><text>Prototype or not. Where is it?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_13"><text>With me. I left it in this cave for the time being. Just before you came, I happened to run into it. Need it? Take it.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_14"><text>Excellent! Thanks, Fang.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_15"><text>Better tell me how much longer I have to sit here.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_gauss_dialog_16"><text>Not much longer...</text></string>

<string id="klyk_last_dialog_0"><text>I decided to come check on you. We might not see each other again...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_1"><text>I was happy at first... What are you up to? Doctor came by, said you decided to push all the way to the very center.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_2"><text>I was there already, at the center's edge. But only at the edge... I still was not allowed to reach the main thing. Just do not ask who stopped me or what that "main thing" even is. I do not know, but I want to understand. You cannot solve this head-on. That's how it is.\nSo what about Doctor, did he do anything?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_3"><text>Yeah... you are one stubborn bastard, Marked One. And Doctor... no, he has done nothing yet. Feels like he has no ideas. But Ivar stopped by, you know, that same one. Turns out he is the top specialist in the Zone on zombies.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_4"><text>And what did Ivar say?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_5"><text>Nothing specific. Just gave me hope. Asked what I remember and what I do not. Asked about Strelok too.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_6"><text>What did he want with Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_7"><text>Bad wording. Not Strelok himself, his experiments. We talked about them too. After our last meeting I tried to squeeze something else useful out of my memory, and one conversation with Ghost surfaced.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_8"><text>About what?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_9"><text>About the "Black Mark." You mentioned it before, but it did not trigger anything in my head then. Later, when I really strained my brain, the memory surfaced.\nGhost once asked if I knew anyone with the "Black Mark." I asked why. He said Strelok needed either a carrier of it or the mark itself. Could not find one, it was driving him crazy. One day the network was full of requests to help get rid of it, then suddenly silence for weeks. So one thing led to another, and Ghost said if Strelok could not find it, then he needed a live Monolith member.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_10"><text>How? Were you planning a raid on Pripyat, or where were you going to catch them?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_11"><text>Hold on, I was not done. Just any Monolith member would not do. He needed someone who had not completely lost touch with their human side, not fully submitted to another will. I said: and where do you find one like that? Ask everyone, "Hey pal, you are not a Monolith guy by chance, are you? Planning to become one?" I did not get him. What kind of joke was that...</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_12"><text>And he?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_13"><text>He said he did not understand it himself, but Strelok needed exactly that kind. Seems Strelok had some idea about it, but as usual he was in no hurry to share. Ghost tried more than once to start that conversation, and Strelok brushed him off: "I was just thinking out loud, do not worry about it..." Ghost got nothing out of him. I think Strelok did not really let Ghost into his business. Or maybe something happened between them and he stopped telling him everything.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_14"><text>That Ghost is quite a character... So you trusted him completely?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_15"><text>Who can you trust completely in the Zone? Fate threw us together, we handled different business. We told each other what we thought was necessary, but... I held some things back, and he did too. We both understood that. We just did not dig into it. We worked well together, that was enough.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_16"><text>All right, then why did this topic interest Ivar?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_17"><text>I do not know. I told him everything I told you, plus this episode about the Mark. I think it gave Ivar some important idea. I heard his breathing speed up, he got agitated, started packing for the road right away.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_18"><text>What do you think rattled him so much?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_19"><text>I told you, I do not know. He only muttered that he urgently needed to dig up his old materials and notes on the "effect of fragments" of something on something. Dropped a couple more unclear phrases, like he was talking to himself, then said goodbye and left.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_20"><text>You think he went outside the Zone for those "old materials"?</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_21"><text>Even if he did, fine. As long as he can help me become a normal person again. I have no strength left. He is my last hope.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_last_dialog_22"><text>He is a smart man. If he latched onto an idea, I am sure your forced "confinement" here will end soon. Until then, wait and hope, Fang, wait and hope. Farewell.</text></string>

<string id="doc_klyk_after_mon_dialog_0"><text>How is Fang? How is he doing?</text></string>
<string id="doc_klyk_after_mon_dialog_1"><text>Still unclear. Nothing definite. Ivar came by, and I explained how to reach the cave where Fang is staying.</text></string>
<string id="doc_klyk_after_mon_dialog_2"><text>So Ivar has fully recovered now? Is he still somewhere here in the Thicket?</text></string>
<string id="doc_klyk_after_mon_dialog_3"><text>I do not know where he is. He looked pretty lively already. As I understand it, he is going to assemble another group of "seekers." Hardly anyone from his old group survived...</text></string>
<string id="doc_klyk_after_mon_dialog_4"><text>I see. I probably will not catch him at the Bar now. Then I should visit Fang while I am here.</text></string>

<string id="reminders_main"><text>General</text></string>
<string id="memuars"><text>Personal Notes</text></string>
<string id="sl_beginning"><text>Who am I?</text></string>
<string id="sl_beginning_text"><text>Maybe a dream, maybe reality... Some vehicle... a long ride, then darkness, but what was before that? And did any of it really happen, or is it just a nightmare? I cannot make sense of it... pure delirium... Now Sidorovich, the local trader, decided to call me Marked One. It all feels like a bad dream. \n \nOnly I cannot wake up. What do I do? Where do I go? Worse yet, who am I? First thing to understand is that for now I'll have to run errands for this Sidorovich. He says he saved my life, after all... And maybe things are not that bad, I'll look around, pull myself together, maybe my head clears up.</text></string>
<string id="sl_first_opinions"><text>First Impressions</text></string>
<string id="sl_first_opinions_text"><text>Well, well, well... Got some fresh air, saw the local critters... tried the local "attraction" called anomalies... Judging by the fact that I survived at all, I have dealt with the Zone and its quirks before, but my head stubbornly refuses to remember who I am. \n \nSidorovich, the sly old fox, realized he can use me almost for free now, and he wants to do exactly that. Maybe that is why on the Cordon he asked Doctor to patch me up? Why else does he need a "dead man"? And now I am apparently his eternal debtor, in simple words, his eternal slave. No way. Not forever. Sure, at first I will not refuse his errands. He can help with gear, for example. And he keeps hinting about that damned Strelok, at least giving me a direction for where to start. For now, Strelok is my only thread to the past. If he is connected at all, since Sidorovich says I kept repeating the name "Strelok" in delirium. You can see anything in delirium. But I did keep repeating it for a reason... \n \nAnyway, I need to move north. Sitting on the Cordon, I am not going to remember anything. We'll see what comes next...</text></string>
<string id="sl_first_deep_raid"><text>First Dangerous Foray</text></string>
<string id="sl_first_deep_raid_text"><text>Sidorovich asked me to look into some documents. That means a serious run through the Zone, to the former Agroprom Research Institute. Fine, I am ready to cooperate. I will find something and make it clear to Sidorovich that after that, we are square for all his "kindness and care." I am not working for him for free after this. If he wants something, he pays. \n \nAlong with the task, I heard trader gossip that sounds more like a legend, about some area to the north on the way to the Zone center where your "brain starts boiling." Considering my head is clearly not right, I should look into that and ask around. Who knows, maybe I was there too... \n \nAlso, the trader assumes Strelok somehow learned to pass through that area (or maybe he is lying just to give me a reason to go there). He says the traders want to know how. Why they want it is obvious, they want access to untouched artifact fields. Their potential Klondike does not interest me much, but information about Strelok... that is worth trying for.</text></string>
<string id="article_agr_krot_sos_name"><text>Meeting Mole</text></string>
<string id="agr_journal_krot"><text>Met Mole at Agroprom. Just a meeting, nothing special. I do not remember him, he does not know me. But Mole told me about some Strelok stash in the Agroprom underground. Maybe a story, maybe not, but that stash talk did not come from nowhere. Looks like I should go down there and search it myself. Who knows, maybe I will remember something. \n \nBut the most interesting part was not that. He said there is some strange gas in the tunnels, or suffocation, or God knows what. And you should not go into places like that without a suit with a mask or a gas mask. I have a feeling I already knew that... or suspected it. From where? From whom?.. \n \nAnyway, I have to try. No idea what waits for me there. Hope that stash reveals something, if it even exists...</text></string>
<string id="agr_krot_secret_info_name"><text>Strelok's Stash</text></string>
<string id="agr_journal_cache"><text>I made it into "Strelok's stash" after all. I do not even know what sixth sense told me how to get in. Maybe intuition, maybe memory kicked in. But by all logic I should not know that. It is not even Strelok's personal stash, it is a secret place for a whole group, and I definitely was not part of it. And in that stash I met one of that group's members, Fang. \n \nFang is in pretty bad shape, and he gave little information, but enough to understand this: besides Strelok himself, there were two more in his group, Ghost and Fang. According to Fang, Ghost and Strelok tried to reach the very center of the Zone. Why, and most importantly how? \n \nSo for now we have one name of someone who might know where to find Strelok: Ghost. Because Fang was badly hurt, is stuck underground, and does not really know much. There is also some scientist, a mutual acquaintance of theirs, but that is still too little to go on. As for Strelok, it looks like we really do need to search the northern regions of the Zone. \n \nAnd one last thing: Doctor. He met Strelok, he knows this secret place, and he visits Fang, so he knew him before. Should I assume Doctor was in Strelok's group too? I need to find that out when I meet him. \n \nAnd I should try to help Fang himself. Right now he is blind, and his head is not in good shape (just like mine). But if Fang recovers and starts remembering specifics, I definitely need to talk to him, which means I have to contact the scientists at Yantar.</text></string>
<string id="journal_before_darklab_documents_name"><text>Barkeep's Task</text></string>
<string id="journal_before_darklab_documents"><text>I spoke with Barkeep at Sidorovich's request. From the papers I brought for that old swindler, the traders guessed that there is a classified underground lab in the so-called Dark Valley, designated X-18. Barkeep offered me a trip there to search for information and documents. Says I should talk to Borov, the leader of a bandit group, urges caution, and... he is clearly not telling me everything about that dungeon. \n \n
I am not exactly thrilled about meeting bandits, much less crawling into some underground hellhole. On the other hand, why not establish contact with these guys. My encounters with lowlifes at the Garbage were not pleasant, but maybe with contacts I get some kind of "roof," and armed idiots will stop getting in the way of my search. Right now, my search and information matter more than anyone's turf wars.\n \nAnd that is the key thing in Barkeep's request: he is hinting about a path north and "showing concern" for my search for Strelok. Sure, he is hooking me, obvious enough, wants to send the one who "needs it most." But who knows what he knows and what he might tell me if I do what he asks. \n \nAs for the safe way north, where Strelok might be now, Barkeep somehow connects it to X-18 and to information that can be dug up in that lab. If it is all connected, I will pay Borov a visit. First, I am not signing anything and making no promises. Second, it would help to learn Dark Valley and its inhabitants better. And build contacts. Good relations always help you get information.</text></string>
<string id="journal_bar_darklab_documents_name"><text>Lab X-18</text></string>
<string id="journal_bar_darklab_documents"><text>Yeah... Lab X-18 and its current inhabitants are no cheerful place. I never thought filth like that could exist. What surprised me is the entrance has been blocked for ages, yet those creatures live there just fine. What do they even eat, and where did they come from? There were bodies of some scientists too. Sure, skeletons in suits, been there a long time, but why did the monsters not tear them apart? Or were the monsters full, and those people got there recently? Then how did they get in? I do not understand. It just does not add up... \n \nI found some documents... Did not understand much from those either. Looks like technical specs for some blocks for Kaimanov emitters. But here is the interesting part: those blocks were meant for another lab, code X-16, also classified. And in one big room I saw some kind of bubble. I should ask someone smart what that is... \n \nWell, I found what I found. Hope it is enough for Barkeep to figure out the route north. Though skimming the documents, I saw no hints about that, except mention of some emitter that seems to be somewhere in the north. Whether it is connected to Kaimanov's emitter is unclear. Let Barkeep sort that out.</text></string>

<string id="journal_bar_x16_documents_name"><text>Is the "Brain Scorcher" Man-Made?</text></string>
<string id="journal_bar_x16_documents"><text>Barkeep (or more likely one of his tame eggheads) dug up something from the X-18 documents. He talked about the "Brain Scorcher," which I have already heard about here and there. He thinks the emission that blocks the path north is connected to Lab X-16, located near the scientists' camp at Yantar. They are studying something there that resembles the Scorcher's effect. \n \nAll that is great, who is studying what and where, but Barkeep seems to think he has me saddled through my interest in Strelok and now plans to drive me all the way to the "Scorcher." As far as I can tell, traders have not just now become interested in the path north, but there are not many people willing to look for it, if Barkeep is dumping it on me despite all the people at the Bar, now and before I showed up... Or maybe those he sent do not come back. And here he has a "fool" who remembers nothing anyway... \n \nAnd that is where my real interest begins. If someone turned this "Scorcher" on, or keeps it on, why? And what exactly does it "scorch"? And whose brain... What about my memory? Was mine scorched too? Have I been there already? Questions, nothing but questions, and only scientists might answer at least some of them. Only they might know what this "Scorcher" is and why. So whether I like it or not, my road now leads to the Zone's scientist crowd, to Yantar.</text></string>
<string id="journal_before_vasilyev_pda_name"><text>One Step From Ghost</text></string>
<string id="journal_before_vasilyev_pda"><text>So I am almost one step away from one of Strelok's people. Ghost and a pair of eggheads went down into Lab X-16. One problem: I am unlikely to find him alive. And even if he survived, I probably will not find him there anyway, because getting into that lab is not simple at all, it may take time, maybe a lot of time, to figure out how to get in. \n \nSakharov named the hours when the emission drops and we can try to find the entrance to that underground site. But he does not know where that entrance is. Wandering around hoping to find it by luck is stupid. I need precise information, because I will have to move fast so the emission does not fry me and turn my brain to mush. \n \nAt the very least, Ghost's traces (or maybe what is left of him) should be in X-16. There are no other leads yet. I can also look for papers Barkeep wants while I am there (if they are there). And on the way I need to pull some switches and levers, scientists want me, if I get inside, to try doing something with the emission source. Then they can study everything on site. If I run into switches, why not try. If I manage to shut something down, I can study this lab and nearby areas more carefully. Maybe I will find something that leads to Ghost, or even Strelok himself. Right now the main thing is to find out the entrance for sure.</text></string>
<string id="klyk_help_name"><text>Helping Fang</text></string>
<string id="tex_klyk_help"><text>I finally got a device from Sakharov, more precisely a helmet, which he says can help Fang reach the surface. Sounds good, but I have doubts. \n \nFirst, Sakharov's odd wording. He clearly does not see Fang as a full human being. Then why did he get interested in him right away? Why Fang? Just one more unknown stalker, and there are already plenty wandering around his bunker. But Sakharov immediately latched onto the idea of extracting Fang specifically and... taking him somewhere. \n \nAnd that is the second issue. Where, and why? And why do I have to stay out of sight while this happens? So no one sees me... or so I do not see something? Not clear... \n \nOn the other hand, Fang needs help. Right now he is the only one who could tell me anything about Strelok and Ghost. If they take him somewhere, maybe he will get help there, you cannot really treat him in the Zone. But then I probably will not see him again or talk to him, about Strelok or anything else. If I try to move him somewhere else with this helmet instead of Sakharov's helicopter, there is no guarantee that helps him and does not drive him underground again to sit without help, just in a different place. But then I could still talk to him... and maybe he would get better there and remember something. I have doubts...</text></string>

<string id="tex_strelok_spots"><text>Searched all over the Swamps... In a drift near Tuzla I found scattered fragments of information. Nothing substantial, just correspondence, equipment orders, incident reports. The name Lebedev comes up, one of the leaders of the Clear Sky group. If only I knew where he is... \n \nMost likely these are remnants of the papers passed to Ghost. Either these scraps were the least important and he took the rest, or, more likely, they are just pieces of what did not burn. Ghost probably would not bother hauling waste paper, he read it all and burned it, and this part remained. \n \nOf everything I read, only mentions of teleporters and scientist interest in them seem important. Fang said Strelok "teleported" to the Swamps. From where? Could this have been some special teleporter, the same one a "Yakovlev group" was looking for? I should ask the scientists about that. There is also mention of mysterious disappearances, scientists vanished. Are those the same scientists who wanted to study a "space-time anomaly," or is this about something else? Maybe Strelok came by teleporter and left the same way. Or vanished like those scientists... Again a pile of useless questions. In any case, all this happened long ago, and for now this lead is a dead end, but I should remember it. I found neither Ghost nor any traces of him or Strelok in the Swamps, nor anything left of Clear Sky.</text></string>
<string id="journal_after_kill_brain_name"><text>A Strange Dream</text></string>
<string id="journal_after_kill_brain"><text>I do not understand what I did. I pulled a lever and... blacked out. Probably the strain of the past few days. While I was out, I had a dream... \n \nA photograph. A gray-haired man is holding it, and a huge dog spins at his feet. The man looks into the distance, but all around is swamp, and the landscape is nothing like in the photo. In the fog you can barely make out a figure walking away. The man mutters as if talking to himself: "If it's so important, then why did you never properly explain what this place is, and where you got this photograph..." Then... I see, from the side, a young smiling guy on the threshold of a hut, cheerfully saying: "If only you knew where I managed to go, and what I saw there!"... and so on. \n \nIn short, nonsense. The gray-haired man is Doctor, that is how I took him in the dream, probably because Doctor was the first person I saw when I woke up on the Cordon. But who was the second one? I understand these are associations, a dream is just a dream. But... it all felt too real. Which raises questions. Is the second man me? Or who? Or is it Strelok, whose name they say I kept repeating in delirium. \n \nWhy am I even writing down nonsense like this as if it matters? It feels important. And most important is that photograph of something that can exist only at the very center of the Zone. And that "Doctor-like" question, how did you take that photo? How could you take it at all? Nobody can get in there. Barkeep and the rest who keep pushing me only want to find a way there, to the center. It is like something from another time... Or maybe just a dream, fatigue from the past days and thoughts twisting themselves into strange shapes. I do not know what to think. But it all felt too real, even in a dream. \n \nAt least Barkeep can calm down. I did find some papers, which means I did my job. Let him sort them out, he will probably be satisfied with that. For me, the main thing from that trip is I found at least a tiny lead: some Guide on the Cordon. He has some photo with Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="journal_before_radar_task_name"><text>"Brain Scorcher"</text></string>
<string id="journal_before_radar_task"><text>As expected, nothing is simple. The X-16 documents gave little. Barkeep says there was mention that the bunker entrance is coded. But of course he knows neither exactly where the entrance is nor the door code. \n \nFirst, I need to find out how to break through there at all. Second, I need to find the entrance itself. Third, I need a way to get inside, either learn the code somewhere or find a working decoder. And lastly, but important: if the documents I already found are so vague, where does Barkeep get his certainty that the underground lab bunker contains the antenna control point for the "Brain Scorcher"? He only thinks so, with no guarantees. He just sees I want to move forward and plays on that, and whether I come back is of little concern to him. In that case the question is: am I ready to go to the "Scorcher"? Do I really need this? \n \nAll right, I can look for a decoder, that does not commit me to anything and might be useful somewhere. Fine, I can also talk to Sakharov, a scientist could provide useful information. I can even try going to Radar and looking around. Maybe I will find some leads there. Then we'll see what the situation dictates...</text></string>
<string id="journal_doctor_dream_name"><text>Doctor's Note</text></string>
<string id="journal_doctor_dream_text"><text>I hit a booby trap in Strelok's stash, the same trap I myself had advised Fang to set. Stupid. \n \nI do not even know why I crawled back into that hole again. Guide on the Cordon said Doctor might be here, and I hoped to meet him and learn more about Strelok. From what Fang said, Doctor could have been part of Strelok's group. Doctor himself said on the Cordon that this is exactly why I interested him, I kept repeating Strelok's name in delirium even though, by his calculations, I could not have met Strelok at all. But I never found Doctor. \n \nNone of this would be worth writing down if not for one strange incident. I blacked out and in some dream or delirium I saw Doctor. Very clearly, as if he was right there speaking to me. But he spoke to me either as if I were Strelok, or as if I were his son... And he said strange things. Something about the Monolith being an illusion, about how I had always tried to understand something... always? understand what? Where does this come from? I only saw Doctor briefly a couple of times on the Cordon. \n \nStill, it was some kind of dream. Another "waking dream," like in those labs. Why does this keep happening to me? It feels like every time I try to understand something, every time it feels like I have grabbed a lead, some force blocks me, shuts down my mind, and puts me to sleep. Or tries to plant something in my dreams... I do not understand. Maybe I am making things up just to explain what is happening somehow. \n \nBut Doctor really was there and left a message. For me. He has some business or trouble, has to lie low and stay out of sight for a while. He has a safe place in the Foggy Thicket, and I definitely need to meet him and talk.</text></string>
<string id="journal_barier_name"><text>Barrier</text></string>
<string id="journal_barier_text"><text>So I have reached the very edge of the inhabited Zone. Beyond it is unknown. Though... it is clear enough what can be there: monsters, anomalies, uncertainty, and death at every step. \n \nBut plain death may even be the better option. From beyond the Barrier come not only waves of mutants, but sometimes zombies too, bodies without souls. Who are they? Former stalkers chasing rich loot, or Monolith castoffs? Or maybe they are Monolith members themselves, the ones rumored to be somewhere around Radar and beyond? Too many unclear questions. But the main one is: what keeps drawing everyone there? If so many are coming out of there, how many are still left there... Why are stalkers so eager to go there, knowing the dangers and seeing the outcome of those attempts, zombies? Everyone is pulled north like by a magnet. Do they really believe that strongly in the Monolith legend and wish-granting? Or... is it something else. \n \nThink all you want, I am going there too. I explain it to myself however I can, "find myself, find out who I am, find Strelok," but they also had their own explanations. They all went there under different pretexts, thinking they were going by their own will, knowing where and why, not being pulled by something beyond their will. \n \nI wonder if anyone ever reached that Monolith at all. Maybe those are the ones who found happiness there. Happy brainless idiots... Nothing to think about, regret, worry, care for, just walk around, grunt, and drool with a happy smile. \n \nMaybe it is self-deception, but I would rather think I am the one choosing to go there for an important and serious reason. And that I will not end up like them... At least that gives me some goal and some hope that I will learn what I want there.</text></string>
<string id="journal_radar_name"><text>Radar</text></string>
<string id="journal_radar_text"><text>A very hostile place... You rarely meet stalkers here now. Maybe people once came here hoping to find their Klondike of artifacts, but over time the number of daredevils dropped sharply. Those who pushed through seem to have joined the zombie ranks, who now make up most of Radar's population. Not counting Monolith members... \n \nThough these "Monolith members" are not much like the ones veterans talk about. They are more like stalkers on the edge. They cannot go farther, and no longer have the strength to leave. Something keeps them... Maybe they are future zombies? Maybe a person does not become a zombie at once, maybe it is gradual: first speech gets bad, then they rock their heads by the fire, then it's just "kiiill." Who knows... Then what are real Monolith members like? Better not know, probably... \n \nThis area is called Radar because of some strange antennas emitting some strange field. But here's the question: those antennas and transmission systems were clearly built by people, before the disaster. Someone built them on purpose. And whatever those antennas emitted back then, whatever they were built for, they did not decide to run by themselves. People switched them on knowing they would emit... So why does nobody now know what that emission is? Why did the professor have to calculate downtimes and come up with some suit... Does that mean the emission is no longer what it used to be? Someone retuned it, altered it... Unclear. \n \nAnyway. Let the smart heads think about that. If the professor says it can be turned off, then it should be turned off, and what difference does it make what it used to emit. And if it can be turned off, we can push farther north... Though I am no longer sure myself what I expect to find there. But turning back now is not an option...</text></string>
<string id="journal_rad_mission_name"><text>Antenna Control Point</text></string>
<string id="journal_rad_mission_text"><text>I managed to push through to the control point on Radar. What was I even thinking!? I expected difficulties, sure, but if I had known in advance what I would face, I never would have gotten into this adventure. But time was pushing me, and I kept thinking, just a bit more, a few more meters, around that turn, and if it fails I will turn back... And of course I miscalculated. Already on the antenna grounds I clearly understood I would not make it back, the emission was about to rise again, and my only option was to go down into that bunker and look for an exit by luck. Inside the bunker it was no better than on the surface. But there was no way out and no route for retreat... \n \nThe bunker itself did not impress me. I expected control panels, monitors, installations, red buttons, all the stuff to run such a complex, and instead I found wreckage and abandonment. Felt like everything had been evacuated in a hurry, and whatever was left got looted. I did find some working equipment. Flipped some switches from one position to another. Something turned on or off, I have no idea. No time to think, I had to get out, or I'd be stuck like that unlucky nerd whose exit code I found by pure chance. How did he even get in there? I need to ask Sakharov about him. \n \nThere was a surprise on the way out. Maybe from the extreme stress of the run, maybe from sheer exhaustion, I fell asleep. No idea how long I was out. Judging by the watch, around two weeks, though it could have glitched. Why these strange coincidences? Every lab means some kind of blackout... But the main thing, I survived and got out. That's the miracle. Tell anyone and they will not believe it. Better not tell them anyway. They'll just say I am an idiot for going, and that all this is a lie. Hell, I barely believe I did it myself...</text></string>
<string id="journal_ivar_name"><text>Ivar</text></string>
<string id="journal_ivar_text"><text>Turns out my whole heroic trip into the labs under Radar was for nothing. Whatever I switched on or off there does not matter. Ivar and his people did everything elsewhere. Yes, that same Ivar I have heard so much about. How they pulled it off, he still cannot explain clearly. The emission damaged his health, and all that is left is to hope for his body's strength, for a miracle, or for Doctor. \n \nIvar, it turns out, is some kind of medic, maybe even a scientist, and he worked with psychos, as Barkeep said. But most important, he knew Strelok himself! Were those his notes on the flash drive I found in the Agroprom underground? If so, he is now my first real thread in these so-far fruitless attempts to trace Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="journal_monolit_name"><text>Monolith</text></string>
<string id="journal_monolit_text"><text>Does some Monolith really exist, or is it a myth, an invented deity? In any case, those called Monolith members believe in it, worship it, speak of it with reverence... But who are they themselves? Psychos, half-zombies maybe. On Radar they mumbled nonsense, and their leader, who could still talk a little, said they no longer need language, that they communicate mentally somehow. Think what you like: maybe they really are "enlightened," or maybe they can no longer separate reality from whatever is in their heads, just talking to their own hallucinations. \n \nBut to hell with it, everyone goes mad in their own way. What interests me is why this is not the first time they almost treat me as one of their own. What did they mean by "blocking"? Where am I supposed to go, or can go, and why do they need that? What is supposed to call me, and to where? They speak in such a way that you can only guess what they mean. Maybe they think one thing and say another, because they cannot express it clearly. So they pick whatever words they have not forgotten yet. And by "blocking" or my "calling" I might be understanding something different from what they meant. \n \nOnly one thing is clear so far. They need some "seeds," artifacts, planted, and supposedly that will let me pass where no human goes. Maybe to that same Monolith... Their Connector will tell me after I do what they ask. Fine, we'll see. I do not even know myself what is better now, so let it unfold on its own. Tossing artifacts into anomalies is no big deal. If it calls, it calls, and maybe it really will tell me how to reach the very center of the Zone. If not... I will not be too upset.
