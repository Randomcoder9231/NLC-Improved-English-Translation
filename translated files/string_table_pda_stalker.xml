<string id="stalker_001"><text>Note:\nImportant:\nPick up the package from Seriy and pass it to his brother.\nAt the Bar, closer to midnight, he goes by Rutik. Ask the Barkeep.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_002"><text>Note:\nPass Kuznetsov regards from Predybailo.\nVerbatim: told me to bow with respect.\nHeТll let you through for free.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_003"><text>Note:\nOnce the network is back up, pass this to everyone:\nEmission after 3 a.m.\nInfo from the Freedomers at the Barrier.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_006"><text>Incoming:\nLyoha! Turns out the Guide is a beast! Can you believe it, he wiped out a pack of dogs past the bridge! Alone!!! O_o</text></string>
<string id="stalker_006_1"><text>Outgoing:\nNah, thatТs BS! There were three of them Ч the Guide and a couple other stalkers. Still badass though. I think *that* guy was there too, you know, the fancy oneЕ WhatТs his nameЕ You know who I mean.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_006_2"><text>Incoming:\nNope.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_006_3"><text>Outgoing:\nHe stopped by our village not long ago, had a Vintorez with him, said hi by the campfire and then took off fastЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_006_4"><text>Incoming:\nAnd whoТs Vintorez?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_006_5"><text>Outgoing:\nMan, youТre such a rookie! ItТs a sniper rifle, insanely good. Costs a fortune though. IТll make enough and buy one someday. Hey, move to our village already Ч whyТre you rotting on that farm?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_006_6"><text>Incoming:\nNah, youТve got military patrols there. They donТt come here.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_006_7"><text>Outgoing:\nSo what about the military? Sidorovich runs things here Ч all good.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_006_8"><text>Incoming:\nNope, IТm fine where I am.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_006_9"><text>Outgoing:\nYour loss.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_007"><text>Outgoing:\nKolyan, you know anyone from Freedom?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_007_1"><text>Incoming:\nI do, but that stays between us. What do you need?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_007_2"><text>Outgoing:\nNeed to get in touch with Screw. Need small screwdrivers Ч Phillips and Torx. Really small, like watchmaker ones.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_007_3"><text>Incoming:\nDo you really have to go to the Warehouses for that? Nobody closer has them?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_007_4"><text>Outgoing:\nSeems like no. I asked around, annoyed everyone with those screwdrivers already. And why go myself? Stalkers go there anyway Ч someone can pass them along.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_007_5"><text>Incoming:\nYou realize how much theyТll charge you for that? Anyway, if you really need it, IТll tell my guy. HeТll message you and say heТs from me.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_007_6"><text>Outgoing:\nYeah, thanks!</text></string>

<string id="stalker_008"><text>Incoming:\nVityok, weТre screwed, save us! BorovТs guys boxed us in the Valley, near the factory. We wonТt fight back, thereТs too many of them Ч weТll surrender. Find two УNight StarsФ and bring them here. Be by the bulldozer near the little swamp tomorrow morning. Hand the artifacts to their courier, IТll settle up with you later.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_008_1"><text>Outgoing:\nNo need to search. ChemistТs got two Night Stars. IТll borrow them. But keep in mind Ч it goes on your tab.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_008_2"><text>Incoming:\nThatТs fine. Just keep it quiet, donТt tell our guys. We dug up something interesting Ч no need for noise. ;)</text></string>
<string id="stalker_008_3"><text>Outgoing:\nDidnТt get a thing, but I smell profit. :) IТm in. Just be careful there, donТt start flexing, or youТll get shot. And the two Night Stars will be wasted. :))</text></string>
<string id="stalker_008_4"><text>Incoming:\nThx. ThatТs it Ч donТt message me again.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_009"><text>Incoming:\nSanyok, hey! Heard the news? Turns out Sakharov is growing watermelons inside the bunker perimeter!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_009_1"><text>Outgoing:\nWhat nonsense? HeТs not growing any watermelons, I was there just yesterday.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_009_2"><text>Incoming:\nDid you go *behind* the bunker? Exactly. HeТs got a whole melon patch there. Write to him, make a deal, buy a watermelon Ч youТll never get anything tasty from beyond the perimeter.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_009_3"><text>Outgoing:\nI doubt itЕ I canТt message him, but if IТm there soon IТll check. And whyТd you even think he has a melon patch? OhЕ got it. Some kind of joke?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_009_4"><text>Incoming:\nNot a joke. Someone told me today, and supposedly some Marked One told them.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_009_5"><text>Outgoing:\nYeah, great sourceЕ People say heТs not all there in the head. Still, IТll check.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_010"><text>Incoming:\nHey, ValyukhaЕ You were collecting something for Sidorovich, right?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_010_1"><text>Outgoing:\nHey. Yeah, I was. Why? Heading there? Maybe you could deliver it? I really canТt leave right nowЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_010_2"><text>Incoming:\nNo need to rush. They say he died last night.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_010_3"><text>Outgoing:\nWho?! Sidorovich?! Get outta here! No wayЕ What from?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_010_4"><text>Incoming:\nNo idea. Got a message from a Cordon guy: УSidorovich died at night. Funeral Ч Monday, 10 a.m., at the Cordon.Ф</text></string>
<string id="stalker_010_5"><text>Outgoing:\nDamnЕ So what now? Who do we bring loot to?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_010_6"><text>Incoming:\nNo clue, but someone will take over for sure. Nature abhors a vacuumЕ you know the rest.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_010_7"><text>Outgoing:\nYouТre full of it!.. I asked around. Look:\nУTo everyone! IТm alive and well, not planning to die. The joker has been identified and punished. Ч SidorovichФ\nHa! See?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_010_8"><text>Incoming:\nYeahЕ Bastards. Nothing sacred.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_011"><text>Outgoing:\nSidorovich!?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_011_1"><text>Incoming:\nYeah?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_011_2"><text>Outgoing:\nWhenТs the next time youТre sending letters outside?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_011_3"><text>Incoming:\nThe day after tomorrow. Then on the 27th.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_011_4"><text>Outgoing:\nHow much?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_011_5"><text>Incoming:\nIs it just a letter? Or a package?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_011_6"><text>Outgoing:\nJust a letter. Home.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_011_7"><text>Incoming:\nSame as usual. Bring it Ч weТll work it out. The 27th will be cheaper.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_011_8"><text>Outgoing:\nIf I give it to Seriy at the Garbage today and he comes to you Ч will it go out the day after tomorrow?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_011_9"><text>Incoming:\nWhat am I, Federal Express? How should I knowЕ IТll try. DonТt seal the letter, put the money inside. And remember Ч I read letters and cross out anything unnecessary if needed. DonТt put anything else in the envelope besides money. Only the letter goes beyond the perimeter Ч everything else stays with me.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_011_10"><text>Outgoing:\nYeah, I know, I sent one recently.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_011_11"><text>Incoming:\nAlright then. Bring it today, IТll try to send it the day after tomorrow morning.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_011_12"><text>Outgoing:\nThanks!</text></string>

<string id="stalker_012"><text>Incoming:\nLyoha! Tomorrow weТre heading to Agroprom. The militaryТs got rockets for launchers Ч need about tenЕ no, better twenty.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_012_1"><text>Outgoing:\nYeah right, IТm already running. Why do you need rockets?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_012_2"><text>Incoming:\nDuty threw us a job. VoroninТs birthday is coming up. They want fireworks. I agreed. You in? Pays well.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_012_3"><text>Outgoing:\nThey do pay well, sure Ч but the military shoots well too. And not fireworks, but heavy calibers from APCs. IТve got doubtsЕ Feels like you just want to stock up under this excuse. We need launchers there like last yearТs snow.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_012_4"><text>Incoming:\nWeТre not stealing! I messaged a guy there Ч for some vodka heТll get you anything, even a УTopol.Ф</text></string>
<string id="stalker_012_5"><text>Outgoing:\nNope, not going. And I donТt recommend it to you either. YouТll get shot Ч and worst of all, theyТll take the vodka.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_012_6"><text>Incoming:\nMan, youТre such a wuss! WhyТd you even come to the Zone then? ShouldТve stayed homeЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_012_7"><text>Outgoing:\nNone of your business. And donТt offer me this kind of crap again.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_013"><text>Incoming:\nMityai, you write poetry, right? Hi.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_013_1"><text>Outgoing:\nWell, sometimesЕ Hi.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_013_2"><text>Incoming:\nI need something about the Zone, but for a girl, you know?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_013_3"><text>Outgoing:\nWhatТs there to get? And whereТd you even find a girl, tell me Ч maybe I could tooЕ Alright, something like: УThe Zone is scary, death at every step, but I love you and think only of you, even in my deadliest hour.Ф That work?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_013_4"><text>Incoming:\nYeah, something like that. HowТd you figure it out?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_013_5"><text>Outgoing:\nI actually wrote something like that just recently. Here, from my latest:\nWe lit a fire near the village.\nResin on the logs like tears,\nWith a guitar I sang a song\nAbout your smile and your eyes.\nYouТre far away right now,\nBetween us stand the checkpoints,\nItТs not easy for me to reach you,\nAs long as IТve got bolts in my pocket.\nThatТs just an excerpt. Will it do?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_013_6"><text>Incoming:\nYeah, thatТs exactly what I need! Can you give me the whole poem?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_013_7"><text>Outgoing:\nFour thousand. Or a УFlash.Ф</text></string>
<string id="stalker_013_8"><text>Incoming:\nDamn, youТre really ripping me off!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_013_9"><text>Outgoing:\nThen write it yourself!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_013_10"><text>Incoming:\nAlright, IТll think about it. IТll ping you again.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_014"><text>Incoming:\nSakharov is a bastard!!!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_014_1"><text>Outgoing:\nHey. WhatТs wrong? What did he do to you?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_014_2"><text>Incoming:\nMade a deal with the professor for a good job. Came to see him Ч and thereТs already some Duty guy sitting there. Sakharov goes, УSorry, friend, youТre late, itТs already been taken.Ф And both of them are smirking. Especially the Dutyer Ч smug face!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_014_3"><text>Outgoing:\nWell, what did you expect? Obvious: whoever came first got the job. Sakharov favors Duty.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_014_4"><text>Incoming:\nThatТs not how business is done. We had an agreement!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_014_5"><text>Outgoing:\nAh, forget it. Come with me to the Garbage the day after tomorrow Ч Bes needs something there. HeТs gathering a big group.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_014_6"><text>Incoming:\nTo shoot bandits or what? Is Bes even there? Heard he leftЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_014_7"><text>Outgoing:\nNah, probably not bandits Ч itТs quiet there now. But somethingТs neededЕ And why do you care if itТs Bes or not? WeТre broke. ThereТll be work, and people to talk to.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_014_8"><text>Incoming:\nYou and your talkingЕ Alright, letТs go. In the morning?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_014_9"><text>Outgoing:\nYeah. You at the Bar now? IТll find you there tomorrow at eight. WeТll reach the Garbage right around noon.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_014_10"><text>Incoming:\nDeal. IТll be waiting.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_015"><text>Incoming:\nHey! We need food supplies. HowТs that looking right now?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_015_1"><text>Outgoing:\nHey yourself! Things areЕ not great. What exactly do you need?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_015_2"><text>Incoming:\nSomething non-perishable. Mostly canned food. Dry rations. Alcohol.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_015_3"><text>Outgoing:\nHeading far?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_015_4"><text>Incoming:\nAbout three or four days. Five of us. Plus another seven at the site Ч need supplies for them too.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_015_5"><text>Outgoing:\nNope, IТm almost cleaned out. SidorТs getting a delivery tomorrow. Or rather, tonight.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_015_6"><text>Incoming:\nThatТs a long walk to him.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_015_7"><text>Outgoing:\nThen donТt walk. Order delivery.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_015_8"><text>Incoming:\nToo expensive. And no guarantee itТll get through. Heard dogs are breeding like crazy at the Garbage again?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_015_9"><text>Outgoing:\nKolyan, I canТt help you anyway. So Ч Sidor. Or you can try the Barkeep. :)</text></string>
<string id="stalker_015_10"><text>Incoming:\nVery funny.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_015_11"><text>Outgoing:\n:)) So Ч Sidor. No question.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_015_12"><text>Incoming:\nThanks, that really helped.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_016"><text>Outgoing:\nIgoryosha, save me!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_016_1"><text>Incoming:\nWhat now?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_016_2"><text>Outgoing:\nI need to lay low, urgently. Disappear for about two weeks.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_016_3"><text>Incoming:\nUhЕ and what do you want from me?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_016_4"><text>Outgoing:\nLong story short, you or one of your guys might get approached, asking about me. They know I ran jobs with you. Tell them I headed toward AgropromЕ Say I definitely went thereЕ Or better yet, add that someone from Agroprom said dogs tore me up, or something like thatЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_016_5"><text>Incoming:\nDonТt even say that! Is it really that bad?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_016_6"><text>Outgoing:\nYeah, bad :( Tell your guys too, make sure everyone says the same thing Ч went to Agroprom and hasnТt come back.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_016_7"><text>Incoming:\nAlright. And where do I find you if needed?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_016_8"><text>Outgoing:\nSorry, canТt say yet. IТll find you myself. Once things settle downЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_016_9"><text>Incoming:\nGot itЕ Take care.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_016_10"><text>Outgoing:\nIf everything works out, IТll repay you. WonТt forget it.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_016_11"><text>Incoming:\nDonТt sweat it. WeТll settle up later.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_017"><text>Incoming:\nSo, whatТd you dig up?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_017_1"><text>Outgoing:\nWhere?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_017_2"><text>Incoming:\nWhere, whereЕ in Karaganda. In that underground lab you were talking about, remember?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_017_3"><text>Outgoing:\nAre you stupid? I was just repeating rumors. We werenТt even planning toЕ You go down there and you wonТt come back.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_017_4"><text>Incoming:\nThen why talk about it at all? I heard some hotshot went down there. Supposedly hauled back so much he could buy out the whole Zone.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_017_5"><text>Outgoing:\nHa! Keep listening to fairy talesЕ SomeoneТs just inflating their price. Cheap talk. From what IТve heard, nobody can even find the entrance, and youТre telling me Уhauled backФЕ Just chatter.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_017_6"><text>Incoming:\nAnd how do you know the entrance canТt be found? That means someone looked Ч not just to check, but to go down.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_017_7"><text>Outgoing:\nThen you go find out and head in, since youТre so brave.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_017_8"><text>Incoming:\nCome onЕ Still, if you hear anything Ч youТll let me know?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_017_9"><text>Outgoing:\nYou bet!</text></string>

<string id="stalker_018"><text>Incoming:\nHi.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_1"><text>Outgoing:\nYeahЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_2"><text>Incoming:\nHeard about Cartaviy? What do you think?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_3"><text>Outgoing:\nWhatТs there to say Ч he lost it. Walked straight into an anomaly.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_4"><text>Incoming:\nYou think he did it himself?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_5"><text>Outgoing:\nAbsolutely. Guys were nearby, saw him tossing bolts. Thought he was trying to go around it Ч turns out he was marking it to be sure. Then he took a running leap straight in.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_6"><text>Incoming:\nDamnЕ Lost his mind?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_7"><text>Outgoing:\nHe was already pretty УoffФ before that. Screamed at night, and during the day kept ranting about some piece of the Monolith. Got all beaten down, likeЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_8"><text>Incoming:\nRemember about a month ago, another guy was going on about some Monolith fragments?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_9"><text>Outgoing:\nBobos? Or whatever his name was Ч Gundos?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_10"><text>Incoming:\nYeah, him. I saw him recently Ч unrecognizable. Almost the same thing: screaming at night, babbling nonsense about the Monolith during the day. Then they found him hanged a few days ago. Someone said he seriously pissed someone off and got strung up by thugs. But I think he did it himself. He was like a shadow lately Ч who could he have crossed that badlyЕ Lost it too. ThereТs something in common hereЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_11"><text>Outgoing:\nProbably a coincidence.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_12"><text>Incoming:\nSo what is that piece of the Monolith? Some kind of artifact?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_13"><text>Outgoing:\nOh, here we goЕ I donТt know and I donТt want to. УJellyfishФ artifacts are enough for me.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_14"><text>Incoming:\nStill?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_15"><text>Outgoing:\nItТs just nonsense. Why listen to every lunatic?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_16"><text>Incoming:\nStill, not for nothingЕ Alright, forget it. IТll look into it myself, let you know.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_018_17"><text>Outgoing:\nTo hell with that! DonТt you dare! I donТt even want to know Ч IТll sleep better that way.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_019"><text>Outgoing:\nWhen will the money be ready? IТm waiting.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_019_1"><text>Incoming:\nHey! We agreed Ч on the 30th!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_019_2"><text>Outgoing:\nI need it now.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_019_3"><text>Incoming:\nWhere am I supposed to get it right now? I only have a job the day after tomorrow.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_019_4"><text>Outgoing:\nI donТt care how, but the moneyТs needed the day after tomorrow. I helped you out, didnТt I? Now you help me.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_019_5"><text>Incoming:\nI donТt have it now! And thereТs nothing to sell, you know that!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_019_6"><text>Outgoing:\nYouТve got an assault rifle? Go to Sidor Ч he was offering good money to take out some bastard.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_019_7"><text>Incoming:\nNo, IТm not a hired gun. I wonТt go. Why donТt *you* go yourself?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_019_8"><text>Outgoing:\nIТm busy with other things right now! I owe the boys a pile of cash the day after tomorrow. IТm going on a job too Ч IТll be back the morning after tomorrow. IТll have part of the money, plus your debt. I donТt care, got it? Find it however you want, or IТll hand your debt over to the boys.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_019_9"><text>Incoming:\nHave you completely lost your mind?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_019_10"><text>Outgoing:\nThatТs it. YouТve been warned.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_020"><text>Incoming:\nYou at Agro? What the hell is going on at Agroprom?!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_020_1"><text>Outgoing:\nThereТs plenty of weird stuff there. Which part interests you? :)</text></string>
<string id="stalker_020_2"><text>Incoming:\nThe part where the military reinforced the checkpoint from the Garbage. Full-time guard, day and night. Nobody I ask knows why. You know anything? Maybe someone on your end heard something?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_020_3"><text>Outgoing:\nDoesnТt ring a bell. CanТt negotiate your way through?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_020_4"><text>Incoming:\nThey wonТt even let us close. Almost shot me Ч fired warning shots over my head.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_020_5"><text>Outgoing:\nYeahЕ I just asked Sidor Ч heТs playing dumb. Says heТll look into it. Really weird. Maybe theyТre running an operation? Try going there tomorrow Ч they probably wonТt keep reinforcements long. Almost certainly a one-off op.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_020_6"><text>Incoming:\nTomorrow?! One of ours, Sanya Stepnoy, fell into some well there, broke his leg, canТt get out. HeТll bleed out! Ask Sidor to at least let *me* through!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_020_7"><text>Outgoing:\nSidor says Ч not before the day after tomorrow. Turns out army brass has been crawling around there for two days already, get it? DonТt even try Ч elite спецназ is guarding the place.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_020_8"><text>Incoming:\nScum. Looks like SanyaТs going to die. What a stupid way to goЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_020_9"><text>Outgoing:\nWhat can I do? The Zone, brotherЕ</text></string>

<string id="stalker_021"><text>Incoming:\nHey. Been to the swamp in the Valley lately?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_021_1"><text>Outgoing:\nWellЕ what do you want?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_021_2"><text>Incoming:\nIn the Dark Valley near the swamps, all the grass turned yellow overnight. In the morning we were heading there for artifacts, got to the bridge and turned back. DonТt know if itТs safe. Everything around is green, but near the swamps itТs yellow Ч unnatural. Like someone painted it.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_021_3"><text>Outgoing:\nAny Flesh roaming around there?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_021_4"><text>Incoming:\nNo one. Like everything died out. ThatТs whatТs scary. But overnight a whole breeding ground of artifacts appeared there. Even capsules lying around Ч can you imagine?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_021_5"><text>Outgoing:\nMessage Semenov. He knows this kind of stuff.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_021_6"><text>Incoming:\nAlready did. No reply. And we want to go, but weТre scared, and mom says no.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_021_7"><text>Outgoing:\nTo hell with it Ч donТt go. As they say, you only live once.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_021_8"><text>Incoming:\nYeah. Still hurts thoughЕ</text></string>

<string id="stalker_022"><text>Incoming:\nSo, where are you? DidnТt forget our talk, did you?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_022_1"><text>Outgoing:\nWhich one? Remind me. I wasnТt quite myself yesterday, mightТve forgottenЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_022_2"><text>Incoming:\nWhat, were you wasted yesterday? We agreed to go on a run. ThatТs no way to do business.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_022_3"><text>Outgoing:\nYeah, maybe a bit. I remember the run Ч just remind me where and whyЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_022_4"><text>Incoming:\nOh, screw you! IТm not going with you. YouТve probably already had a hair-of-the-dog, and IТm supposed to drag you along? No thanks. I went all the way to the farm like an idiot, thought youТd be there alreadyЕ You screwed me over.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_022_5"><text>Outgoing:\nWhy so offended? Alright, IТll square up with you later Ч got some ammo in my stashЕ DonТt worry. I really canТt go today. WeТll sync up some other time.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_022_6"><text>Incoming:\nForget it, chatterbox. All talk, thatТs all youТre good atЕ</text></string>

<string id="stalker_023"><text>Outgoing:\nHeard a chopper went down?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_023_1"><text>Incoming:\nHeard. So?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_023_2"><text>Outgoing:\nThey say it was hauling food for the military. Provisions and all that. Could stock up for free. You in?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_023_3"><text>Incoming:\nAnd how do you know it was food, and for the military?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_023_4"><text>Outgoing:\nVovan dragged in a whole crate of canned meat Ч barely made it. Now heТs strutting around all proud. Soldiers are guarding the crash site. The crate got flung far away, so he grabbed it.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_023_5"><text>Incoming:\nMaybe it wasnТt from the chopper. Maybe it was just lying around.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_023_6"><text>Outgoing:\nYeah, rightЕ what just lies around in the Zone? Definitely from the helicopter. And if there was one crate, thereТs more.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_023_7"><text>Incoming:\nSure, the military will just hand it over. TheyТre dying to see you.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_023_8"><text>Outgoing:\nWeТll negotiate, trade. Worth a tryЕ Maybe thereТs some unguarded stuff lying around.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_023_9"><text>Incoming:\nNope, IТm not going. You can try explaining weТre Уon businessФЕ TheyТll shoot us as looters.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_023_10"><text>Outgoing:\nSuit yourself. DonТt come begging later.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_024"><text>Outgoing:\nHey bro. IТm in trouble. :(</text></string>
<string id="stalker_024_1"><text>Incoming:\nWhat now?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_024_2"><text>Outgoing:\nI was at that place, saw it. CanТt get it alone, and there are tons of snorks. Barely fought my way out. One of them bit me. :(</text></string>
<string id="stalker_024_3"><text>Incoming:\nSo burn the bite with iodine or antiseptic and bandage it.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_024_4"><text>Outgoing:\nI did. Just scared something bad might happen. I wonТt turn into a snork, will I?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_024_5"><text>Incoming:\nYou probably stabbed yourself on a branch out of fear when you saw the snork :) All that crap about ghouls, werewolves and such Ч fairy tales. What, you think youТll grow a trunk now? A dog bit me once, didnТt turn me into a dog. Forget it. YouТre alive Ч thatТs what matters. Heal up, then weТll go together.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_024_6"><text>Outgoing:\nA dogТs one thing, a snorkТs another. They say their saliva is toxic. I wonТt grow a trunk, sure, but what if I start degrading and end up like themЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_024_7"><text>Incoming:\nStop whining!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_024_8"><text>Outgoing:\nMaloy was telling how a bloodsucker clipped him once. Says his blood doesnТt clot right anymore. Gets worse every day. HeТs scared to even cut sausage Ч afraid heТll cut himself and wonТt be able to stop the bleeding.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_024_9"><text>Incoming:\nMaloy made that bloodsucker story up himself. If a bloodsucker really УclippedФ him, dogs wouldТve eaten Maloy long ago. HeТs always been a liar and a coward.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_024_10"><text>Outgoing:\nEasy for you to say Ч you werenТt bitten by a snorkЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_024_11"><text>Incoming:\nTell the guys that if you start growling, they should shoot you so you donТt bite anyone. :)</text></string>
<string id="stalker_024_12"><text>Outgoing:\nYou just joke around. My whole armТs swollen. :(</text></string>
<string id="stalker_024_13"><text>Incoming:\nDamn it! Enough! IТm logging off Ч tired of your whining.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_025"><text>Incoming:\nHow are things with you? What are you up to?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_1"><text>Outgoing:\nNothing. Sitting around, waiting.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_2"><text>Incoming:\nWaiting for what? The weather?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_3"><text>Outgoing:\nNahЕ waiting for some truck.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_4"><text>Incoming:\nWhat?!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_5"><text>Outgoing:\nWell, we made a deal with some eggheads. They tossed us a job: according to their calculations, some kind of truck should pass through here. WeТre supposed to spot it and record everything. They gave us seven daysТ worth of food for it. How they calculate this stuff Ч no idea. Just said if no truck shows up this week, then thereТs no point waiting anymore.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_6"><text>Incoming:\nAre you completely nuts?! TheyТre probably trying to catch the Уdeath truckФ!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_7"><text>Outgoing:\nSo what? Freebie. Our jobТs just to wait and take photos Ч weТre not planning on catching corpsesЕ And if it works out, thereТs pay too. Think about it: do nothing for a week, just sit in one spot. DonТt even have to scavenge for food.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_8"><text>Incoming:\nAnd what exactly are you going to photograph Ч dust from the wheels?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_9"><text>Outgoing:\nNahЕ the road runs into a blockage here. ItТll either crash, stop, or turn around. If it shows up at all. ItТs fineЕ We wonТt even eat all that food Ч weТre doing nothing and not even drinking vodka. Plenty will be left, even if we donТt film anything. And if we do, we get paid too. Either way, profit.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_10"><text>Incoming:\nAnd how do they know a truck will pass there?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_11"><text>Outgoing:\nAsk them. Maybe because theyТve seen them everywhere else, but not here yet? I donТt know. ThatТs why theyТre the eggheads Ч to calculate stuff.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_12"><text>Incoming:\nI wouldnТt have agreedЕ you heard what they say about those trucks?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_13"><text>Outgoing:\nYou didnТt want to go to the Valley either Ч always shaking, Уthis is there, that is thereФЕ ThatТs why youТre always broke. Smart people find easy jobs and donТt shake like youЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_14"><text>Incoming:\nIТm not shaking. Still wouldnТt wait for a truck.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_15"><text>Outgoing:\nRelax Ч all those stories are BSЕ Alright, IТll tell you later.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_025_16"><text>Incoming:\nAlright.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_026"><text>Incoming:\nHey, bro. HowТs it going over there?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_1"><text>Outgoing:\nStill screwed :(( Waiting for some kind of doctor. The guys said heТs coming.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_2"><text>Incoming:\nA real doctor?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_3"><text>Outgoing:\nNo idea. Not like IТve got a choice right now.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_4"><text>Incoming:\nDamnЕ At least the place youТre holed up Ч is it safe?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_5"><text>Outgoing:\nItТs okay. The guys left food and water Ч I can last a couple of daysЕ probablyЕ At least comms still work. They said theyТll come back.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_6"><text>Incoming:\nWhy didnТt they drag you out right away?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_7"><text>Outgoing:\nDidnТt dareЕ Said theyТre afraid IТll fall apart if they move meЕ heh.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_8"><text>Incoming:\nYouТre joking at a time like this? Well, thatТs somethingЕ Hang in there.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_9"><text>Outgoing:\nWhat else can I doЕ To be honest, IТm remembering my whole life right nowЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_10"><text>Incoming:\nAnd?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_11"><text>Outgoing:\nItТs all messed upЕ and nothing can be fixed anymore, damn itЕ :(</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_12"><text>Incoming:\nHey, cut it out! Everything will be fine Ч the doctor will come and weТll get you out.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_13"><text>Outgoing:\nCome onЕ who are you trying to foolЕ You, uhЕ write to her, you know whoЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_14"><text>Incoming:\nEnough! Just hold on! At least these couple of days, IТm begging youЕ HeТll come for sure. IТll find him myself and drag him to you by the collar!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_026_15"><text>Outgoing:\nIТll tryЕ</text></string>

<string id="stalker_027"><text>Incoming:\nHey there :)</text></string>
<string id="stalker_027_1"><text>Outgoing:\nWhoТs this? What do you want?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_027_2"><text>Incoming:\nItТs Kolyan. Remember Agroprom?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_027_3"><text>Outgoing:\nAh! Hey, buddy, sorry Ч didnТt recognize you. You had a different nick, I thinkЕ Thanks again for the meds, you really helped me out.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_027_4"><text>Incoming:\nNo problem :) Hey, do you know Lyokha the Cat?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_027_5"><text>Outgoing:\nUmmЕ the one who bragged he stabbed a boar to death with a bayonet for a bet? Yeah, sat by the fire a couple times. Why?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_027_6"><text>Incoming:\nYeah, him. IТm looking for him. If you see him, tell him Kolyan Denezhka smashed his PDA against a wall while drunk, got a new one, and wellЕ rebuilding the address book. Tell him not to message me for now if heТs looking. And yeah, new nick for sure Ч decided to change it with the new PDA, people were getting annoyingЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_027_7"><text>Outgoing:\nIТll pass it on. And youЕ how are you yourself?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_027_8"><text>Incoming:\nCanТt reach him. Thanks. Take care.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_028"><text>Incoming:\nSo, did you decide? Going with us or what?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_028_1"><text>Outgoing:\nHow long is the trek exactly? And whatТs it like there overall?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_028_2"><text>Incoming:\nWhoТs going to tell you the truth, brother? Luck decides. But like Mokryak says: a week of fear Ч and your whole face is in marmalade. So, you in?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_028_3"><text>Outgoing:\nIf everyone goes, then IТm in too, obviously! When do we move?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_028_4"><text>Incoming:\nTomorrow we stock up. You gear up too Ч nobodyТs carrying your sausage and ammo for you. And be there sharp the day after tomorrow Ч donТt be late!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_028_5"><text>Outgoing:\nI will.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_029"><text>Outgoing:\nSeal, for GodТs sake, youТre an idiot. What the hell did you do?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_029_1"><text>Incoming:\nWhat are you on about?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_029_2"><text>Outgoing:\nYou were yapping by the campfire yesterday like a nightingale about how thereТs loot at the Farm you could haul away with dump trucks! Do you know how many people will rush there now? ItТs probably packed already. Even dogs and cats are bolting from there, eyes popping Ч never seen so many stalkers in one place! WhyТd you blab? Now thereТs nothing left but trampled grass!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_029_3"><text>Incoming:\nWatch your mouthЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_029_4"><text>Outgoing:\nBottom line, Seal, thatТs not how things are done. WhatТs ours stays ours Ч no need to talk.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_029_5"><text>Incoming:\nYou telling me what to do? Do I owe you something? About yesterday Ч did you clear the path with me at the Farm? Or cover my back while I was scouting?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_029_6"><text>Outgoing:\nDid you share the last thing with me? If good people asked me to look out for you, then I did. Now I see who Ч no, what Ч you really areЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_029_7"><text>Incoming:\nThatТs it then. I donТt know you anymore.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_030"><text>Incoming:\nYou know where I can get a suit fixed?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_030_1"><text>Outgoing:\nWhere else? Head to the Bar. What, didnТt you know?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_030_2"><text>Incoming:\nI know. No chance though. Those red-and-black guys declared me persona non grata. Got a message from a Dutyer today. They figured me outЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_030_3"><text>Outgoing:\nDamnЕ what happened? HowТd that go down?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_030_4"><text>Incoming:\nStepped into an anomaly, barely crawled out. SuitТs torn to shreds, just rags hanging. I collapsed nearby, heard bushes rustling Ч panicked and fired a double tap. DidnТt even think.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_030_5"><text>Outgoing:\nKilled anyone?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_030_6"><text>Incoming:\nDonТt know. They hit the dirt instantly and lobbed a couple grenades back. When I realized IТd fired at Duty, I bolted on all fours. The anomaly saved me Ч shrapnel got pulled upward, and I crawled like that all the way to the Garbage. Now IТm laid up. Turns out I broke my left arm too.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_030_7"><text>Outgoing:\nHoly hellЕ alright, hang on, IТll check somethingЕ</text></string>
<string id="stalker_030_8"><text>Outgoing:\nAlright, hereТs the deal. Talked to a guy named Prokhor. He said one of them got his arm pierced Ч Lyopyokha the Gray. But he saw him later, nothing serious hit Ч heТs up and already patrolling near their base. TheyТre reasonable guys overall. I explained your situation, we talked it through. So Ч once you recover a bit, come by. IТve got about three liters. From you Ч two artifacts each, so get ready. TheyТre not asking for more.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_030_9"><text>Incoming:\nBrother, thank you! I owe you big time!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_030_10"><text>Outgoing:\nItТs fine, weТll settle it :))</text></string>

<string id="stalker_069_1"><text>¬ход€щие: \nѕросто открыть дверь пробовал? ѕомнитс€, не было там никакого кода. Ќу или постучись, а вдруг откроют.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_070"><text>¬ход€щие: \n“ут предложили либо ј -103, либо ј -101. „то посоветуешь?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_070_1"><text>»сход€щие: \nƒа фиг знает... “ут с какой стороны ровн€тьс€... ” 101-го больше точность, надЄжность. Ќо тут вс€ фишка в патроне. ” 101-го калибо 5.56 - весьма редкий в наших кра€х, за ним аж на —клады переть порой приходитс€. ј вот у 103-го калибр 7.62, вот убойна€ штука и получилась. ƒа и патрон весьма распространЄн, поэтому € его и вз€л в своЄ врем€.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_070_2"><text>¬ход€щие: \nѕон€тно, будем думать...</text></string>

<string id="stalker_071"><text>«апись: \n" арусель". —вист такой, завораживающий, как у ветра перед выбросом. ј над тем местом ещЄ будто рой мошкары. “ут не зевай - собрал силы в кулак и дЄргай быстрее от ней, пока не засосало.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_072"><text>«апись: \n"¬оронка". ѕо звуку, как " арусель", только пыль вокруг неЄ крутитс€ с листь€ми по земле. » движение воздуха заметнее. “ут главное не перепутать, ежели "мошкары" над гулом нет - стало быть "¬оронка", а не " арусель". „тоб проверить кидаю спички счирканные, жменькой, что-то т€желее опасно - может и в ответ прилететь.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_073"><text>«апись: \n"“рамплин". √ул такой, как от поезда вдалеке. » круги в том месте расход€тс€, как от камн€ на воде. ¬ырватьс€ невозможно, така€ же гадость, как " исель", ну то есть невидимый "’олодец" - замедл€ет и рвЄт изнутри; € еЄ про себ€ "—топ-кран" называю. Ћучше близко не подходить.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_074"><text>«апись: \n" исель", или невидимый "’олодец". ќпасна€ зараза. ¬л€паешьс€ - так разъест костюм, кровь пойдЄт. ’ими€ - одно слово. ќдно хорошо, если идти вдумчиво и не спеша, то его хорошо слышно (булькает, как тот суп из рекламы). ј кинешь чем в то место, так расползаетс€ п€тно, как —ахаров говорит, "€довито-химического" цвета.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_075"><text>»сход€щие: \n—лух нехороший по «оне идЄт. ћонстры мен€ютс€. “е кто выжил, говор€т, твари стали издали сталкеров мочить. ’имеры орут и от их рЄва сталкер как —идор при виде арта замирает столбиком и ни бежать, ни прыгать не может. ј эта тварь двухголова€ прыгает и рвЄт его в клочь€.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_075_1"><text>¬ход€щие: \nЅрехн€...</text></string>
<string id="stalker_075_2"><text>¬ход€щие: \nƒа вр€д ли... ќт авторитетных людей слышал: кровосос так вообще - вроде и не дот€гиваетс€ до сталкера-бедолаги, а гад такой, кровь-то сосЄт! » не щупалами своими адскими, а как будто нож у него в лапе невидимый! » режет, режет потихоньку, сволочь, пускает кров€нку! ѕосле встречи с ним сталкеры как мумии в бинтах вылезают! ќдин сказал: теперь без мешка аптечек и бинтов из Ѕара ни ногой! ¬о как.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_076"><text>»сход€щие: \n¬олк, мы тут парочку твоих оборванцев на —валке подобрали у болотца, сид€т голубки под деревом  друга к дружке жмутс€. » что характерно из всей одЄжки только по€с дл€ артов один на двоих и тот без €чеек.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_076_1"><text>¬ход€щие: \n“очно мои?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_076_2"><text>»сход€щие: \nћы сначала подумали педики, хотели зомбакам оставить на перевоспитание, да те завыли, как тушканы на морозе... ¬ общем, гутар€т, что шли по твоему заданию, да боровские их прихватили, ну и пощипали дл€ пор€дка. »з барахла только фонари оставили, да и тот под глазом у каждого.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_076_3"><text>¬ход€щие: \n≈сли с долины через  ишку шли - €вно мои.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_076_4"><text>»сход€щие: \n“вои, твои. ћы их до сто€нки доведЄм, а дальше ты уж сам, нам врем€ с ними тер€ть не резон, у нас свои планы.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_076_6"><text>»сход€щие: \n—пасибо в стакан не нальЄшь и на по€с не повесишь.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_076_7"><text>¬ход€щие: \nЌамЄк пон€л, € на месте, после ходки жду в гости, соберЄм, что «она послала.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_077"><text>»сход€щие: \n учер€во живЄшь, при€тель, раз €щиками дл€ артов разбрасываешьс€. я твою бандуру на —валке подобрал.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_077_1"><text>¬ход€щие: \nЁто с чего это мою?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_077_2"><text>»сход€щие: \nƒа на крышке инициалы, ты ж их при мне царапал, когда у костра сидели. Ќе жалко, новый ведь совсем? — него засохшие зомбаковские мозги соскрести, так и —идору сдать можно, много не даст, но на пропой души хватит.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_077_3"><text>¬ход€щие: \n¬ыкинь! я из-за этого €щика чуть сам в €щик не сыграл.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_077_4"><text>»сход€щие: \n—трасть люблю истории. ј ну, колись.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_077_5"><text>¬ход€щие: \nƒа что рассказывать... Ќа той неделе две капсулы на янтаре сыскал, пока в €щик паковал снорки подошли, € его бросил и на трубу заскочил. ѕ€ть магазинов извЄл, пока отстали.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_077_6"><text>»сход€щие: \n» чЄ? Ќе томи!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_077_7"><text>¬ход€щие: \nЌе чЄкай! ящик подобрал и двинул на ночлег в бункер к ботаникам. ѕроснулс€ - башка никака€, мутит. —мотрю, а на €щике отверсти€ от пуль, видно пока тварей гон€л успел не только в них дырок понаделать.  ороче радиации схватил мама не горюй. ƒа ещЄ и из бункера пинками выкинули - не сунешьс€ теперь...</text></string>
<string id="stalker_077_8"><text>»сход€щие: \nƒа, не свезло... “ы б его Ћисапеду отволок, он хоть малька электричеством трахнутый, но парнишка смышлЄный, и в стволах волокЄт. √овор€т, он их раньше и в руках не держал, но когда после падени€ со столба очухалс€, к нему эти навыки оружейные сами пришли. ќн бы тебе и €щик запа€л за недорого.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_077_9"><text>¬ход€щие: \nјга, как же, пойду € к Ћисапеду! ћне ‘илька Ћапоть рассказывал, как перед последней ходкой попросил Ћисапеда клеммы дл€ €чеек на по€се заменить. Ќа следующий день ‘илька с этим по€сом в —анаторий двинул, а там собачки круги нарезают. ” ‘ильки с собой "ѕузырЄк" был, тот, что собачек отгон€ет, ну он его в €чейку кинул и искру дал.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_077_10"><text>»сход€щие: \nЌу и как, неужели помогло?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_077_11"><text>¬ход€щие: \nЌу как сказать, уж не знаю, что там Ћисапед начудил с клеммами, только  ‘илька вместо "ѕузырька" правое €йцо себе активировал, так  что собачки не от арта, а от его вопл€ разбежались. “еперь без по€са ходит. Ќо с тех пор, как собак увидит  так на землю падает, за пах держитс€ и аптечки кл€нчит.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_078"><text>»сход€щие: \n¬идал у  рота фонарь, € таких в «оне не встречал, интересно, где он такой прожектор надыбал, небось батарейки лопает, как "„Єрна€ метка" здоровье.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_078_1"><text>¬ход€щие: \n рот - старый диггер, говор€т, он в ћоскве библиотеку »вана √розного по кремлЄвским подземным ходам искал.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_078_2"><text>»сход€щие: \n» что? ЌашЄл?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_078_3"><text>¬ход€щие: \n¬идать нашЄл что-то, раз под землЄй кака€-то у него стычка вышла, не то с конкурентами, не то с "федералами", не то с подземными жител€ми: они не люб€т, когда их покой нарушают. ¬ общем, пришлось валить далеко и надолго. “еперь под «оной лазит, команду себе набрал, тоже ищут что-то.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_078_4"><text>»сход€щие: \nј прожектор этот с собой привЄз?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_078_5"><text>¬ход€щие: \n‘онарь ему ѕетренко сосватал. Ётот прохиндей тебе хоть атомную субмарину, хоть јнжелину ƒжоли притаранит, только отстЄгивай.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_078_6"><text>»сход€щие: \nќ как, ну спасибо, старик, обращусь при случае. ј ты  рота давно видел?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_078_7"><text>¬ход€щие: \nƒавно, но от людей слышал, что он после стычки с во€ками в тоннеле на јгро раны зализывает, говор€т, в „ащу собираетс€, в пещеры. ¬сЄ неймЄтс€ ему.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_078_8"><text>»сход€щие: \n¬о жисть: кто на земле счасть€ не ведает, а кто и под землЄй находит... Ќу добро, старина, до встречи. ј —идору передай: ещЄ пару "ћедуз" сварю и подскачу в деревеньку, пусть барахлишко готовит.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_079_1"><text>¬ход€щие: \n„то ты лаешьс€, сынку? я ведь и не программист вовсе. ћоЄ дело маленькое - батарейку зар€дить, экранчик от ваших соплей протереть, кнопочки от тушЄнки почистить, а программные неполадки устран€ть серьЄзный человек должон. “ак что, не взыщите, и, как говорит пана —идора охранник: "„тобы вас не огорчить, можно бабки получить? " </text></string>
<string id="stalker_079_2"><text>»сход€щие: \nЌу ты ухарь, старик. Ћадно, занесу, если скажешь, что за человечек. Ќебось из голованов. Ёто аж на Ѕолото переть придЄтс€ или того паче на янтарь.   ƒоценту-то мне путь заказан: долгари на мен€ патронов не жалеют, даром что казЄнные.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_079_3"><text>¬ход€щие: \n ак величают, спрашиваете? ¬от склероз прокл€тый, на €зыке крутитс€, а в мозг нейдЄт... что-то мушкетЄрское... јрамис, ѕортос... а јтос. “очно јтос. ” него ещЄ шл€па така€ модна€ была с пол€ми, пока он еЄ  –обинзону на марафет не промен€л. ¬от он программер насто€щий, не мне чета.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_079_4"><text>»сход€щие: \n“ы чЄ, калоша амнезийна€, мен€ совсем за дурака держишь? Ётот чЄрт в «оне оказалс€, когда в дурке забор рухнул.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_079_5"><text>¬ход€щие: \nќп€ть лаешьс€, сынок! ћамка заругает!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_079_6"><text>»сход€щие: \nѕрости. Ќервный € после выброса. Ќо ведь он, как носик попудрит, так вещать начинает, что мол видение ему было идти в “уманную чащу и там из артефакта "—имбион" философский камень добыть, ну чтоб типа банки консервные в рыжьЄ превращать. јлхимик, мл€, недолеченный. </text></string>
<string id="stalker_079_7"><text>¬ход€щие: \n≈сть такое дело. ќн там целую секту организовал. Ўл€ютс€ за ним по «оне эти анкелоны, а он у них вроде как жрец верховный.  аждую ночь собирает свою паству у костра и давай проповеди задвигать. ј эти голодранцы рты пораскрывают, сопли до колен... внемлют, стало быть.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_079_8"><text>»сход€щие: \nЌу и как? — успехом?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_079_9"><text>¬ход€щие: \nƒа хрен тебе с двум€ пируэтами!  ак только они с этим "—имбионом" не выЄживались, и в болоте на »вана  упалу топили, и "фиксы", с трупака сн€тые в него вколачивали, только что дерьмом не мазали, да всЄ бес толку...</text></string>

<string id="stalker_079_11"><text>¬ход€щие: \nќни бы так до турецкой пасхи хороводили, пока ќтец ƒиодор эту братию не разогнал. ј предводител€ ихнего в церквушке болотной к стенке прив€зал, да бесов из него изгнал... вместе с мозгами...</text></string>

<string id="stalker_080_1"><text>¬ход€щие: \n„его так?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_080_2"><text>»сход€щие: \n”хо с типчиком надо держать востро. ѕовЄлс€ € - заказал мини-ƒрагунова. “ри дн€ рецепт у «уба выпрашивал, ещЄ день модификат вываривал. ѕоловину наличного боезапаса извЄл, пока до места схрона со снайперкой добралс€. » что?.. ѕукалка тот ƒрагунов, вот что € вам скажу. “олько крыс пугать.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_081_2"><text>»сход€щие: \n¬от смотри: готовил всЄ по рецепту, только вместо "ћедузы" вз€л "√рави", вместо ноги снорка кинул копыто кабана, варил не в " арусели", а в "¬оронке". ѕолучилась полна€ хрень, даже —идор покупать не стал!</text></string>

<string id="stalker_082_1"><text>¬ход€щие: \n—ам не знаю. я на дн€х следил за одним через бинокль, слышал, как он с кем-то по рации говорил.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_082_3"><text>¬ход€щие: \n¬р€д ли. Ётот во€ка с какой-то штуковиной ходил. “ипа сканера. Ўут его знает, что оп€ть задумали.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_082_4"><text>»сход€щие: \nјртефакты, что ли, искал? »ли аномальные пол€ прощупывал?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_082_5"><text>¬ход€щие: \nя слышал, что они нашли там аномалию пространственную, пока не известно куда кидает. »ли наоборот к ним закидывает.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_082_6"><text>»сход€щие: \n“ак вот откуда в той стороне живности столько. »з аномалии той и по€вл€ютс€.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_083_1"><text>«апись: \n...¬ыследил ещЄ одну зелЄную плоть. –ешил сразу перестрелить ей конечность, чтобы не так шибко бегала. “ак она и на трЄх лапах скачет не угонишьс€! Ќо устала быстро. » только € обрадовалс€, как эта тварь на кровососа налетает. “от-то еЄ и прибил с одного удара. я удрать успел, пока он еЄ жрал. —нов без шкуры.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_083_2"><text>«апись: \n...«аходил в  ишку к охотникам. —прашивал, можно ли сделать манок, приманивающий плотей. ∆елательно зелЄных. ѕосмотрели как на дурака. ѕосоветовали попробовать посвистеть в два пальца. Ўутники.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_083_3"><text>«апись: \n...ћогут ли плоти сговоритьс€? ¬ыследил ещЄ одну зелЄную. Ќачал погоню, но эта хитра€ образина выскочила на кабанов. ѕока € от них отстреливалс€, на шум пришли охотники. «авалили и кабанов и плоть. «абрали всЄ себе. ’ал€вщики. ћожет, попробовать поохотитьс€ на псевдопсав?</text></string>

<string id="stalker_084"><text>»сход€щие: \nя на јрмейских складах. ¬идел только что, как химера сталкера загрызла. ¬озле хутора, что у базы —вободы. “ело утащила в дом.

<string id="stalker_085_3"><text>»сход€щие: \nЌу да, подремонтироватьс€, отдохнуть пару деньков.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_085_4"><text>¬ход€щие: \nј чЄ там у вас, кто-то мутировал или через посты кака€-то зверюга прорвалась и кучу народа положила?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_085_5"><text>»сход€щие: \n„его? ј-а, ты про это... —ейчас отпишусь про зверюгу-мутанта. “ы ‘едьку ѕистона знаешь?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_085_6"><text>¬ход€щие: \nƒа его пол-«оны знает. —€дешь у костра с мужиками, колбаску-батончик порежешь, бутылочку откупоришь пси-здоровье полечить... ј тут этот. ѕодваливает. —нимет свои растоптанные берцы, на них носки столетней свежести повесит, и в костЄр почти ноги суЄт. ѕросушить, типа. Ќу и начинает: "ќп€ть сапоги хреновые подсунули..." ƒа задолбал.  упи новые берцы, а не старьЄ б/у, и не ной. ј главное - это амбре. ѕлоти за километр чихать начинают, кака€ уж там закуска. “ак что, он того... прости, √осподи.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_085_7"><text>»сход€щие: \nя бы не сказал. “ы слушай. Ќамылилс€ ‘ед€ на янтарь. —ахар ему работЄнку подкинул - п€ток пар ботинок со снорков на какие-то опыты понадобились. Ќу ‘ед€ настрел€л, обувку поснимал-а она не проста€, сам знаешь. ј потом наш ‘ед€ думает: а нафига платить даже за бэушные берцы, когда есть задаром. » в отличном состо€нии. Ќу, он пару подобрал по размеру, хорошенько очистил. ƒл€ дезинфекции в слабом растворе "’олодца" с водой пару часов подержал. Ќу и —ахарову показывает - так и так, профессор, а ничего, если € эту обувку буду носить? Ќу, —ахар и говорит, что скорее всего это безопасно. Ќо если он будет два раза в день отправл€ть ему отчЄт о своЄм здоровье, то заработает ещЄ и дес€ток научных аптечек. » что наука нуждаетс€ вот в таких клинических энтузиастах.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_085_8"><text>¬ход€щие: \n» чЄ?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_085_9"><text>»сход€щие: \n¬ общем, за€вилс€ он в Ѕар в обновке. √оворил, что может бегать долго без усталости, перепрыгивать заборы и высота теперь ему не страшна, т.к. ботинки как-то по-особому пружин€т. ƒва дн€ он в них ходил по Ѕару, вроде вообще не снимал. ј на третий сидим возле костра в цеху, ‘ед€ начинает оп€ть про сапоги, и вдруг как заорЄт... ѕотом с места аж до потолка прыгает, затем по стенам. ћама дорога€. » орЄт - помогите, ай-ай...  ое-как навалились на него, к земле прижали, чЄ такое, мол. ј потом смотрим - из-под ботинок кровь сочитс€. ƒавай их снимать - не снимаютс€. ’орошо хоть, что ‘ед€ сознание потер€л. Ќожом разрезали - а там ботинки как бы корни в ноги пустили. ∆уть.  ой-как повыдЄргивали всЄ это из ног.  ровищи было. ’орошо, что Ѕƒ на закуп в Ѕар зашЄл.  акой-то мазью смазал, сказал лежать три дн€ и лин€ть из «оны, если ‘ед€ жить хочет. ¬от такие дела.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_085_10"><text>¬ход€щие: \nƒа-а. ќфигеть. ƒа ты больше мен€ знаешь... —лушай, а € же плащик из плоти ношу. ј вдруг тоже, того.  стати, а чего кликуха така€ - ѕистон?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_085_11"><text>»сход€щие: \n«а плащик не боись - некуда там уже того, дальше некуда, хе-хе... ¬ообще-то, их спецы выделывают, ну и плоть всЄ-же свинь€, а не бывший человек. ј кликуха - он как-то в очередной раз достал со своими сапогами, вот ему в берцы и подбросили то ли петарду, то ли ещЄ чего. Ѕыло очень смешно всем, кроме ‘еди. ѕотом неделю про сапоги никто не слышал.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_085_12"><text>¬ход€щие: \n’ех. Ћадно, ты завтра с утреца подваливай на наш хуторок на —кладах. “ема есть, а один € стремаюсь.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_085_13"><text>»сход€щие: \nќк. ƒо встречи.</text></string> 

<string id="stalker_086"><text>¬ход€щее: \n«дорова, брателла! Ќу давай, колись последними новост€ми. Ќи слуху ни духу от теб€.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_1"><text>»сход€щее: \nЌу привет. ” мен€ тут одно очень выгодное дельце наклЄвываетс€. “олько вот говорить € тебе ничего не стану. » давай это, без обид и прочей шн€ги.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_2"><text>¬ход€щее: \nЌе пон€л, это ещЄ почему?!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_3"><text>»сход€щее: \nћне не нужны лишние уши, хочу всЄ по-тихому замутить.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_4"><text>¬ход€щее: \n“ак... ј это уже не по пон€ти€м!  то посе€л плащ дл€ Ѕор€на? ј?! » кому пришлось отдавать свой, чтобы жопу твою прикрыть? ’ожу теперь в этой поганой куртке, как шпана...</text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_5"><text>»сход€щее: \nЌу не начинай. ¬сЄ отдам, если выгорит. ѕомнишь, пахан всЄ мечтал о бабе, мол, почему на всю «ону нет особи женского пола? ’а-ха, прикинь, да? </text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_6"><text>¬ход€щее: \nЌу € не пон€л, ему бабу притащить, что ли, надо или как? ƒа и что за дело и как оно св€занно с бабами?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_7"><text>»сход€щее: \nЌикого приводить не просил, но €-то и так знаю, что будет мне почЄт, уважение, да и не только за это. ƒл€ чего она ему там нужна, € не знаю и знать не хочу. —тарый извращенец... ћен€ только навар интересует.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_8"><text>¬ход€щее: \nƒело-то в чЄм? ƒостал мне зубы заговаривать! </text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_9"><text>»сход€щее: \n ороче. »ду € со —валки на  ордон. “а вылазка получилась очень продуктивной - нашЄл два арта нехиленьких и чью-то нычку с хавчиком. ’а! Ћопух под автобусом посреди дороги заныкал, ЄЄ видно даже из далека было. ќн бы ещЄ посреди дороги этот рюкзак кинул. Ќу да ладно, не об этом базарю. ”же подход€ к воротам на  ордон заметил сталкера, который чего-то в ѕƒј возитс€. —овсем по сторонам не смотрел, ну € и воспользовалс€ моментом... ѕравда перестаралс€, весь костюм его кровью зал€пал. ј он бы мне сейчас пригодилс€.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_10"><text>¬ход€щее: \n“аааак, это уже интересно. „то за сталкер? </text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_11"><text>»сход€щее: \nƒа €-то откуда знаю? я тогда шуму лишнего наделал и мне пришлось быстренько на  ордон убежать. —хватил рюкзак с ѕƒј и дал дЄру. ƒойд€ до  ордона уже решил порытьс€ в нЄм, р€дом никого не было. «алез на вышку около Ѕэ“э-э–а и начал клацать эту хреновину.  оординатов тайника не было, но вот была истори€ сообщений с некой ќксаной. Ќу... ƒумаю, небось с бабами своими уже с большой земли нашли способ общатьс€. ƒа вот только этот сталкер должен был быть еЄ проводником сюда, в «ону, прикинь! » этот лопух попалс€ как раз именно мне. Ќехило мне повезло. Ќу так € и думаю, надо пользоватьс€ шансом. ¬ последнем сообщении говорилось, что она через пару дней будет на окраине Ѕолот. „то она тут забыла - € так пон€ть и не смог. ¬ ѕƒј просто инфа о том, где она будет.  стати! ќна ещЄ бабла отвалить обещала неплохо - двойна€ выгода. ¬от такие вот пироги. “ы представл€ешь, что мне может выгореть, если € эту особу приведу к папе Ѕорову? “о-то. Ќу чЄ? я утолил твоЄ любопытство?!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_12"><text>¬ход€щее: \nќпана. “ак ты решил прикинутьс€ проводником и в ƒолину еЄ приволочь? я не понимаю хода твоей мысли. ѕиши уж до конца, задолбал!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_13"><text>»сход€щее: \nƒа!!! ”же тупой бы допЄр. „его только ради бабла не сделаешь... Ќу так вот, найду прикид путний и завтра с утра выдвигаюсь на Ѕолота. ј там как карта л€жет. Ќе накаркать бы.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_14"><text>¬ход€щее: \nƒавай, давай. —мотри не обосрись там по полной. » да! ѕро мою долю не забудь, € бы не только плащик свой назад хотел. —мекаешь?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_086_15"><text>»сход€щее: \n¬сЄ, достал. Ќе буду € больше на теб€ врем€ тратить.  ак-нибудь потом спишемс€. я почухал.</text></string>

<string id="stalker_087"><text>¬ход€щее: \nЎурик, выручай!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_1"><text>»сход€щее: \n„то случилось? "ћаслину поймал" хе-хе-хе.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_2"><text>¬ход€щее: \n’уже. "„Єрную метку" словил...</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_3"><text>»сход€щее: \nј € ж говорил тебе - нефиг трупы провер€ть, мародЄр недоделанный.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_4"><text>¬ход€щее: \nЋучше помог бы другу. » так тошно без теб€, а выслушать мог и от ЋЄхи.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_5"><text>»сход€щее: \nЋадно. ≈сть способ один, только на совесть.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_6"><text>¬ход€щее: \nƒа мне по барабану, пиши быстрей!</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_7"><text>»сход€щее: \nя слыхал, что „ћ можно отдать человеку, захотевшему еЄ вз€ть себе.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_8"><text>¬ход€щее: \n» кто такое счастье берЄт?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_9"><text>»сход€щее: \nЌу это € не знаю. ’от€, когда был на —валке, в ангаре - ну брал у  улинара энергетики, то слышал, что один мужик дал там зелЄному метку, а тот вз€л еЄ, за 20 тыщ.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_10"><text>¬ход€щее: \nЌи фига себе! Ѕаксов! 20 тыщ! √де € столько возьму? ќдолжишь хот€ бы 5 тыс€ч, а?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_11"><text>»сход€щее: \nƒа не. –убликов наших, конечно, электронных.</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_12"><text>¬ход€щее: \nƒругое дело. я как раз на јгропроме, пойду отдам. ”ж слишком сложно с ней жить. “ы куда собираешьс€?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_13"><text>»сход€щее: \nƒумаю на —клады податьс€, теб€ подождать в Ѕаре?</text></string>
<string id="stalker_087_14"><text>¬ход€щее: \nЌе жди.  то его знает, как всЄ обернЄтс€. ћожешь и не дождатьс€ мен€ никогда.</text></string>
