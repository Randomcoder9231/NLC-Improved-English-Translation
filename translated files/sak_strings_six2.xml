message: Today at 21:20 a group of scientists was discovered. Judging by the tags, Yakovlev and company. All dead, except the guide (unconscious). Could not identify the guide. Bulakhtin, Sychevnik and Avas are transporting the body to base. No other incidents detected. Mutant population unchanged.</text></string>

message: Three out of five test subjects from group A survived the so-called blowout without visible damage. Group B has vision dysfunction, partial destruction of skin cover. Group C disappeared. We ourselves don't understand what happened. Detailed report in the attached file. Copy carried by stalker Bubble. Mikhail, don't give him vodka this time! And forbid him from hanging around the base. Let him take what's needed from the list and get back.</text></string>

subject: Threat analysis from western direction\n
location: 51.203474, 30.331850\n
message: Conducted operations (visual observation, radio monitoring, stalker network scanning) indicate that army units under Major Haletsky have practically expelled stalkers from Cordon. Military control of the area will reduce the number of unwelcome visitors. Probability that military will advance on Swamp on their own initiative is extremely low. Trofimov's group retains Bykov and Leontiev. The rest are transferred to population control group.</text></string>

message: Artyom Petrovich, yesterday someone tried to hack us. Signal probably came from the north. Could not determine source. I suggest strengthening security measures. Specifically switching from RSA to QKD encryption. Take the onboard computer offline.</text></string>

subject: Guide\n
messaqe: The unknown person never regained consciousness, but from fragments of his delirium it appears that Yakovlev's group was conducting research on a space-time anomaly, the peculiarity of which is human teleportation. Something similar is observed in the area of the Fisher's village, where several people mysteriously disappeared.</text></string>

<string id="vovan_dialog_start_102"><text>What, secret facility?</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_103"><text>Secret or not secret, don't wave your piece around for nothing. A respected man lives here. Does good for all stalkers...</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_104"><text>Santa Claus or something?</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_105"><text>You could say that... Mikhalych! He knows and can do a lot. Who are you anyway? What brings you here?</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_106"><text>They call me Marked One, heard of me maybe?</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_107"><text>Marked One? No, haven't heard... I'm Vovan! Some call me Hammer, 'cause I hit twice - second time on the coffin lid!</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_108"><text>I heard that somewhere before... Also - "Drop! Push-ups!" Not related, are you?</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_109"><text>Got the joke... Funny... Joke like that again and nobody will find you anymore...</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_110"><text>Had our laugh... Open up, I need to see your Santa Claus.</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_1101"><text>Come in, Marked One...</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_1102"><text>Night time... Come in the morning.</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_201"><text>Is that you, buddy? What do you want?</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_2021"><text>To see Mikhalych, got business with him...</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_2022"><text>I'm just dropping by to admire you.</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_2031"><text>If it's business, come in.</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_2032"><text>Wha-a-at!? What if something hits you by accident? Huh? Joker...</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_301"><text>Why are you running back and forth... Settle down.</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_401"><text>Hey, Marked One, time to wrap it up.</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_402"><text>What's with the sudden change?</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_403"><text>Night time... Time to rest...</text></string>
<string id="vovan_dialog_start_404"><text>Well I'll be...</text></string>

<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_101"><text>Greetings, kozak. Haven't seen you 'round before... Newbie?</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_102"><text>Don't think so... Can't remember exactly, but I'm surviving so far.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_103"><text>How's that - "can't remember"? Ah! That's what Sidor was talkin' about? You're that... Marked One, or whatever they call you?</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_104"><text>Yes, that's me. I'm looking for a way to get my memory back.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_105"><text>That's the thing. Without memory, you ain't a man, just a bucket with a hole... But a remedy might be found. I told my friend there's an interesting construction not far from here, some kind of installation... And people said it helps with that... with amnesia.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_106"><text>Amnesia?.. interesting. And where is this installation?</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_107"><text>For amnesia, yes... And not too far... Ahem...</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_108"><text>I sense I won't hear this for free?</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_109"><text>See, smart guy - you guessed! This is information, and information is money. Here's the deal: you help me with one business, and I'll tell you everything like you're family - with all the details. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_201"><text>So, made up your mind? Shall we do business?</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_202"><text>First tell me the details... of the business.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_203"><text>Oh, now that's business talk. So listen here... There's this stalker, they call him Sparrow. Flies here and there... very fast. So he let slip once that he has this potion that keeps him from getting tired. Something like energy drink, only much better. He probably doesn't know you, so try asking our little sparrow - what's he drinking? This ain't just for me, this would help all stalkers.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_204"><text>And where am I supposed to look for him? Run around the whole Zone?</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_205"><text>Tsk tsk. I thought you were experienced. In Bar there's a guy, Docent, he can find anyone for you.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_2061"><text>Deal.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_2062"><text>Maybe later.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_2071"><text>Well, good man! Made the old guy happy.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_2072"><text>Well, suit yourself... if you want to walk around with an empty skull, then walk around.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_start_dialog_301"><text>So what about our business?</text></string>

<string id="lim_trader_open_door_0"><text>Mikhalych, you should open the door.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_open_door_1"><text>Why were you banging so hard! The lock jammed.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_open_door_11"><text>What's wrong with you, old man! I didn't even touch your door with a finger.</text></string>
<string id="lim_trader_open_door_111"><text>Oh, can't even joke around anymore... Go on, kozak.</text></string>

<string id="esc_trader_open_door_0"><text>Sidrych! How do I open the door?</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_open_door_1"><text>Same way you closed it!</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_open_door_11"><text>What's wrong with you, old man! I didn't even touch your door with a finger...</text></string>
<string id="esc_trader_open_door_111"><text>Can't even joke around... Go on then.</text></string>

<string id="vorobey_bar_dialog_start_101"><text>Greetings, shake hands? They call me Sparrow. And what's your name?</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_bar_dialog_start_102"><text>I'm Marked One, call me that for now.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_bar_dialog_start_103"><text>Marked One, so Marked One. One more acquaintance. If you feel like chatting, come by, we'll have a talk.</text></string>
<string id="vorobey_bar_dialog_start_201"><text>Hey there, Marked One, what brings you here?</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_0004_sak"><text>Sparrow</text></string>

<string id="esc_bio_dialog_0"><text>Can you tell me about known stalkers?</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio_dialog_1"><text>I can tell you, but you know that's mainly how I earn my daily bread and treatment for my nerves... So... Generally speaking, pour!</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio_dialog_11"><text>More? Get out a bottle, maybe I'll remember someone else...</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio_dialog_21"><text>Alright... Well! Let's drink...</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio_dialog_22"><text>No, I'll pass for now... Going into the Zone...</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio_dialog_3"><text>Ah! That went down smooth!</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio_dialog_4"><text>Interesting, who else do you know about?</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio_dialog_5"><text>Alright, see you later...</text></string>

<string id="bio"><text>Information about stalkers</text></string>

<string id="marsh_provodnik_0"><text>Hi! Don't know how to get to the Base?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_provodnik_1"><text>Why wouldn't I know, I know.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_provodnik_2"><text>Can you show me the way?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_provodnik_3"><text>Can't show you. But I can guide you there, if you please. I'll blindfold you and lead you. Agree?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_provodnik_4"><text>Of course, let's go.</text></string>

<string id="baza_marsh_provodnik_0"><text>Hi! Can I get out of here?</text></string>
<string id="baza_marsh_provodnik_1"><text>You can... I'll lead you out from the Base.</text></string>
<string id="baza_marsh_provodnik_2"><text>Well then let's go. I need to leave anyway.</text></string>
<string id="baza_marsh_provodnik_3"><text>You know the rules, I hope? Blindfold yourself and let's go.</text></string>
<string id="baza_marsh_provodnik_4"><text>Oh, these rules.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_trader_start_101"><text>Well-well, hello there, boy. Who, from where, where to?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_102"><text>I'm Marked One. Haven't heard?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_103"><text>Rumors rarely reach us, we live too isolated. Call me Pakhom, though it's not on my passport, but that's how it goes.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_104"><text>Pakhom, then. You trade here?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_105"><text>Not really, actually. I manage some equipment and gear. I was a supply manager at our research institute, so Ivan Sergeich suggested I come along with him here, to the Zone... I make sure we have everything for life here, but also that nothing extra goes to waste.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_106"><text>So, you won't help with anything?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_107"><text>Why not. Sergeich says, if stalkers help us, then we should help them too. So, we can exchange some useful things for Zone "gifts".</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_108"><text>Exchange... What about selling?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_109"><text>Boy, this ain't a shop! What do you mean sell? For what money? You got currency? Hide it away, might be someone crazy sees it - decides to grab it for free. And I don't need that kind of trouble. I got small stuff here, food, some medicine. Sergeich has interest in all kinds of mutants, so we exchange their parts for what we have. Well, artifacts too will do, gotta pay for our expedition somehow... But no money! No-no.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_110"><text>And Sergeich, is he your boss?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_111"><text>In scientific matters Professor Grigorovich, Ivan Sergeevich, is the head. He came up with the idea to study all kinds of mutants right in the Zone. Got funding, some equipment, attracted young graduate students... And for security and order Demian keeps watch.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_112"><text>Got it. Alright, see you later.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_201"><text>Marked One, is that you? What do you want?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_2021"><text>Came to see what you have for trade.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_2022"><text>Just wanted to chat about life.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_2031"><text>Looking costs nothing. Everything's in front of you.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_2032"><text>We can chat. I'm not in a hurry, and you don't seem to be either.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_start_301"><text>Ah... it's you. What do you need?</text></string>

<string id="marsh_trader_tuzla_dialog_0"><text>Pakhom, I talked with Ivan Sergeevich about papers. He advised me to come to you. Says you're in the know.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_tuzla_dialog_1"><text>Good man Sergeich, just not of this world... Thinks too much about these monsters, this and that... What did he tell you?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_tuzla_dialog_2"><text>He said he gave some notes to the guide who brought you here. Says you talked with him more.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_tuzla_dialog_3"><text>Yes, had to. They called him Ghost, strange guy... Nothing specific, but I didn't like him. Always some secrets, sudden disappearances. When he left for good, I think it became somehow calmer. He went north of the Zone, but left the notes here, in Swamp. Didn't take them with him, I'm telling you for sure. In his last days he let slip that he dumped the junk in the old tunnel at Tuzla. Hunters said it's somewhere near the old railway bridge, north of the swamps.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_tuzla_dialog_4"><text>North, then? Need to pay a visit.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_trader_dialog1_0"><text>Pakhom, don't you take guns for trade?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog1_1"><text>What would I need them for? Newbies, who could be traded them for something useful, practically never come. Those stalkers who sometimes make it to us already have decent weapons and don't need the worn-out junk brought from the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog1_2"><text>Hm, where to put all this iron then?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog1_3"><text>Offer them to Sylvester, our cook... He's a stalker himself, and can transfer some dough, well your virtual ones, to an account. Won't give much, of course, but still...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog1_4"><text>Sylvester? Alright, I'll ask him...</text></string>

<string id="marsh_trader_dialog3_0"><text>I was told you upgrade armor here?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog3_1"><text>Upgrade? Ah!.. That's temporary... Our brainiacs got to some properties in mutants, well and...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog3_2"><text>Temporary? So what needs to be done?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog3_3"><text>Well yes, several days, as I heard. You go talk with Demian, he seems to have coordinated this issue with Ivan Sergeich. He'll tell you the details...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog3_4"><text>Demian? What about payment?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog3_5"><text>Yes, talk to him... I don't stick my nose in this business. It's none of my concern...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog3_6"><text>I'll go see him, what are you getting worked up about.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_trader_dialog2_0"><text>What's this - you trading three-liter jars?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog2_1"><text>Well this isn't ordinary glass, some kind of special crystal... Ivan Sergeich specially ordered it from Sweden. This glass withstands the effects of the "Fruit Punch" acid anomaly!</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog2_2"><text>Wow! And why do you need "Fruit Punch" in jars?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog2_3"><text>Don't you know? This substance preserves flesh! So we use "Fruit Punch" from jars to preserve monsters for study... Well and some westerners pay good money for the opportunity to research this anomaly in laboratory conditions. So, when possible, we ship full jars overseas, and we get the needed equipment... That's how it works.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog2_4"><text>Maybe I should take a couple jars with me?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_trader_dialog2_5"><text>Your choice...</text></string>

<string id="marsh_cook_start_dialog_101"><text>What brings you to our swamp?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_start_dialog_102"><text>Looking for... Myself...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_start_dialog_103"><text>Cool, we haven't had those yet... Everyone tries to find riches, answers to Zone mysteries, wish fulfillment... Nobody looks for themselves. Though, maybe that's wrong. I'm Sylvester, I feed people here. This job is just right for me - quiet, peaceful, no need to shoot... Rest for the soul. What should I call you?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_start_dialog_104"><text>Marked One for now, and then... we'll see.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_start_dialog_105"><text>Well then, Marked One, if you need anything, come by. You never know...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_start_dialog_106"><text>If I need something, I'll come by... See you...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_start_dialog_201"><text>Come over, let's talk, it's getting gloomy somehow...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_start_dialog_301"><text>How about my request, Marked One?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_start_dialog_3021"><text>Haven't had time yet.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_start_dialog_3022"><text>About the revolver? I managed to get it...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_start_dialog_3023"><text>That sounds meaningful. Don't drag it out...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_start_dialog_401"><text>Always glad to see you. Come over.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_start_dialog_501"><text>They say you really let down one graduate student. Not good, Marked One, not good...</text></string>

<string id="marsh_cook_dialog1_0"><text>Sylvester, you buying guns?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_dialog1_1"><text>I take them, building a mini-arsenal here. I think the time will come - very useful. Won't give much money, don't have much need, but still better than throwing away...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_dialog1_2"><text>That's right! How about ammo?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_dialog1_3"><text>Little ammo. If you share - I'll be grateful. But generally, if you rummage around the villages and swamps properly, you can find something... There were serious battles here a year ago.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_dialog1_4"><text>Got it, well alright, I'll give you what I find nearby then...</text></string>

<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_0"><text>I need to charge this battery.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_1"><text>No problem. Let me charge it. Often have to. The path through Swamp isn't short, and artifacts sometimes help shorten it. Our scientific workers constantly need mutant parts, so stalkers in exchange for battery charging offer what they managed to get by hunting. A couple dog tails or good boar hooves. I'll take tushkano heads too, four at a time. Or other acceptable creature parts... Got anything?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_21"><text>Got a couple blind dog tails.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_22"><text>Got two good boar hocks here.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_222"><text>Got a good cat tail.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_23"><text>Got a pseudodog tail.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_24"><text>Will a flesh eye work?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_25"><text>Lucky to get a bloodsucker jaw.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_26"><text>Killed a burer, got his appendage.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_27"><text>Ran into a giant, got a piece of him.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_28"><text>Encountered a controller, was lucky to kill it.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_29"><text>Clashed with a chimera, took a claw as a souvenir.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_30"><text>Sea of tushkanos here, got their heads...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_3"><text>That'll work. Here, take this already charged battery. Come by if you need anything.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_2"><text>Don't have mutant parts, maybe money after all?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_31"><text>What do we need those papers for? Sorry, friend, can't help you then.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_cook_akkum_dialog_32"><text>Yeah, too bad. Well see you, mutant lovers...</text></string>

<string id="semenov_akkum_dialog_0"><text>I need to charge this battery.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_akkum_dialog_11"><text>No problem. Let me charge it. We don't mind...</text></string>
<string id="semenov_akkum_dialog_12"><text>You, Marked One, come in the evening, or better at night. During the day the load on the network is already high.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_akkum_dialog_21"><text>Here, take it.</text></string>

<string id="shurup_akkum_dialog_122"><text>You not in the know? After turning off the Brain Scorcher people rushed north. Everyone gone crazy. Cap left the barrier, they say went to Pripyat itself. Cook ran off to Radar, now no one to drink with. Lots of people left. Lukash is furious. Gathering a team from the old guard. Preparing, food there, medicine, repair kits, fuel for generators, and other junk. So the base has strict economy mode, considering current situation. Our suppliers got stuck somehow. Waiting...

<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_103"><text>What's to look at here... Do you understand about biopsy?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_104"><text>Mmmm... No... What's that?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_105"><text>Well... like removal from a living organism of tissues, cells... for study.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_106"><text>You suggesting to kill someone and cut off their head? Did you mix something up?!</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_107"><text>I meant monster body parts, we need them for research.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_108"><text>Ah-h-h... you should have said that right away. I manage with monsters so far, cut off tails, hooves and other stuff easily. Gotta live somehow, have to. Can bring some.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_109"><text>That's great. No need right now, but later, when they deliver the necessary equipment, can I count on you?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_110"><text>If I'm still alive... Is it possible to somehow remove and study the cells responsible for memory?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_111"><text>There are no such cells. Generally, the question of what exactly in the central nervous system is responsible for memory still remains open in the scientific world.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_112"><text>What if we try to study what's responsible for memory there... well at least on me. I don't mind, as long as it helps.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_113"><text>I understand your enthusiasm, but this isn't serious. Listen, don't interfere, my head's already swelling.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_202"><text>I want to, but can't right now... I need someone to help me. Don't you know, is there such a doctor who can restore memory? Who deals with this... well... what kind of doctor ...ologist?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_203"><text>Memory? Mmm... maybe a psychiatrist? They work with consciousness and memory disorders.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_204"><text>No... I definitely don't need a psychiatrist... forget it.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_start_301"><text>Marked One, wanted something?</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_202"><text>Nothing. Just passing by.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_301"><text>Ah, Marked One! Showed up, then? Ivan Sergeevich sent me a message over the network that we need to read the psycho-matrix of your consciousness. How did you manage to convince him?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_302"><text>If you add material motivation to persuasion, you can't imagine what people sometimes become ready for.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_303"><text>Speaking of material motivation. The professor first ordered me to accept some biological samples from you. Unusual find, as I understand?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_3041"><text>Yeah. Here, take it. Ugh, what nastiness!</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_3052"><text>Uh... yes, only I don't have it with me - left it out so the backpack wouldn't stink. Wait a bit, I'll bring it soon.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_3051"><text>Yeah... Alright, the professor gave permission for the procedure. So listen carefully. See the scanning device to the right of the door? Take off all your things, put them in your backpack or wherever you want. Then sit right under the stand with the emitter, facing me, and sit motionless like that for half a minute. I'll control everything from the tablet. When I put it away, you can get up and dress. Everything clear?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_306"><text>What's not to understand? I'm ready.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_307"><text>Then let's not waste time. I still have a pile of work today.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_308"><text>As if I'm the only one loafing around here...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_401"><text>Marked One, don't dawdle. We already discussed everything. Take off your junk and get under the emitter.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_501"><text>How are you, everything normal? Some people after the procedure can have dizziness, spatial disorientation, drowsiness and... a number of other side effects.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_502"><text>Thanks for warning me in advance...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_503"><text>Come on, what's with you? Like if I told you right away, you would have refused the scanning. Here, drink some water - you'll feel better.\nAnd on this flash drive are recorded the obtained results. Don't know though why you need them, since only a specialist can understand them.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_ecolog_dialog_2start_504"><text>That's not your concern anymore. I'll find someone to show them to. See you... Doctor Mengele.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_101"><text>Well-well... New face? Well, come in, let's talk.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_102"><text>Good afternoon, I'm Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_103"><text>I'm Demian, keep order here. Want something?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_104"><text>I heard there used to be a stalker group base here?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_105"><text>Yes, about a year ago Clear Sky members lived here. What exactly they were doing, I don't know, but probably like everyone else - trying to profit from various wonders... Why do you need to know about them?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_106"><text>I lost my memory, don't remember who I am or where I'm from... There's one thread that, if I pull it, might help me pull myself out from inside.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_107"><text>What kind of thread?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_108"><text>When I woke up, I had a PDA with me that mentioned Strelok. And it seems Clear Sky was interested in Strelok. Maybe some records survived?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_109"><text>Strelok? Yes, I heard about such a stalker. He disappeared, long ago already. Well, about records... We haven't been here long, since the end of winter. Before that no one was here for more than half a year, just... beasts roaming around. So I don't know if any records remained. Generally, I haven't seen anything like that...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_110"><text>Were you here from the beginning?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_111"><text>Ivan Sergeevich found this place, he was here first. He, and one stalker. Only I don't remember what the stalker's name was. Talk with Ivan Sergeevich himself. Maybe he can help you.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_201"><text>Marked One... Did you want something else?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_202"><text>Nothing really. Thinking what to do and where to go next.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_203"><text>Usually stalkers try to go deeper into the Zone, there's higher chances to find good artifacts. As for "what to do"... If you're fishing for work, there's something for you. But don't expect big profit. You see yourself, the scientific brotherhood isn't rich.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_204"><text>What kind of work? And why are you always poking at the map with your finger, looking for something?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_205"><text>Two groups of scientists went missing. One left several days ago with a guide to the north of the swamps, toward Tuzla. Quite some time has passed, no news.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_206"><text>Yeah, the Zone. Easy to disappear here. What kind of guide was with them?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_207"><text>Frol Trickster, experienced stalker. He knows these places well. Couldn't have gotten lost. There's an old fishing village there where our people often set up camp. If you're in the area, take a look. I feel something happened to them.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_208"><text>If I'm in those parts, I'll take a look. What about the second group?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_209"><text>These disappeared earlier in the central part of the swamps. Equipment detected a fifth-class anomalous signature in the area of Burnt Village, whatever that means... Generally, we sent several people to check. There are a couple reliable guides we regularly work with, but as bad luck would have it, none of them agreed to go on this expedition. Had to bring in people from outside. One army guy provided several soldiers for security. In the end they all vanished into thin air. Don't respond to contact, can't track their equipment by radio channel. Honestly, almost no hope left they'll be found alive...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_210"><text>Bad news. I somehow thought it wasn't so dangerous on the outskirts of the Zone. What about this army guy? Did you shake him down? Who is he anyway?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_211"><text>There's one guy here. One Captain Kalinin. Commands a combined squad watching over an oil well. They also do refining there. Pakhom mainly deals with them. Throws them some food, alcoholic drinks, in exchange we get fuel, sometimes they provide security for expeditions.\nWe contacted the captain, of course. He swears he also has no information about the missing scientists or his fighters. Meanwhile the bosses already picked Sergeich's brain clean. And he - mine.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_212"><text>Really no traces at all? And nobody saw anything?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_213"><text>I asked the hunters - no traces, they say.\nThinking, maybe announce a reward for information?! This uncertainty is getting to me! Will you try poking around there? Fresh head, unbiased look and all that...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_214"><text>I'm not much of a tracker, but I'll keep your story in mind. We'll see each other again.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_301"><text>Met Ivan Sergeich? He's our head here.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_302"><text>Haven't gotten to him yet.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_401"><text>Marked One, glad to see you.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_dialog_start_501"><text>Marked One, you're only tolerated here for past merits.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="marsh_leader_gluzov_back_0"><text>Found your botanists who were drowning at the northern fishing village. One of them, Gluzov, asked me to accompany him to a giant's lair, to observe its behavior or something like that. Anyway, they've already returned safe and sound.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_gluzov_back_1"><text>Yes, I was informed. Thank you. Eh, should soap these blockheads' necks and send them home... We have enough problems as it is.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_gluzov_back_2"><text>Come on now. As I understand it, your Sergeich sent them there, so the guys didn't get into trouble through their own stupidity. Besides, they went with an experienced guide.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_gluzov_back_3"><text>Experienced... He was damn lucky to stay alive. And lucky that a Duty squad was patrolling that area, and their leader agreed to help carry unconscious Frol to our camp.\nHowever, everything ended well and that's the main thing. I warned that I couldn't give a good reward, but still, rummaging through Sylvester's stores, I managed to find a decent automatic. Some junkie traded it to him yesterday for half a liter. A bit banged up, but quite fixable. Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_gluzov_back_4"><text>Well... not so beaten up. Could have been worse. Thanks.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_leader_desertirs_dialog_0"><text>I learned something about your scientists. The ones who disappeared in the center of the swamps.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_desertirs_dialog_1"><text>Really?! I had already given up hope. Where are they? What happened to them?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_desertirs_dialog_2"><text>Don't know where, and what happened to them is also unclear. I met those soldiers who were guarding them. They're talking nonsense, about hell, apocalypse. As if those botanists got sucked into a bubble. There's one like that, at Burnt Village. The scientists apparently conducted an experiment, got close to that bubble, turned something on... and disappeared. The soldiers stood aside, they only got their brains rattled. I've heard about "Bungees" before. Maybe those scientists got thrown to the other end of the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_desertirs_dialog_3"><text>And who up THERE would believe this? They, in their capital offices, have no idea what kind of devilry happens here sometimes. Maybe the soldiers are lying, maybe everything's much simpler?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_desertirs_dialog_4"><text>Doesn't look like they're lying. They're scared themselves, sitting in a basement at Forgotten Village, shaking with fear. You can go and ask them yourself.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_desertirs_dialog_5"><text>Maybe it's true... Here, for your efforts.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_0"><text>About the devilry - you were right.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_1"><text>Marked One, what are you talking about?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_2"><text>I found the bodies... at Burnt Village, whole, not even touched by monsters. In scientific suits. Looks like they're exactly the ones who... disappeared.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_3"><text>You're joking?! How's that... I went through everything there with a fine-tooth comb, didn't find a single clue.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_41"><text>That's the thing. They weren't there before, I looked myself. But today... They had papers on them. Look for yourself, there are some surnames here. Yours?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_42"><text>Maybe not yours...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_5"><text>Yes, ours, from those... But how? Where did they come from? We already reported up that they fell into an anomaly, and their white bones were scattered across the entire Zone. Everything had just settled down... And now what, how to explain? Again commissions, investigations, reviews... Nobody needs this anymore.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_61"><text>You asking me? Your bosses - you deal with them.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_62"><text>So maybe... throw them into an anomaly, and that's the end of it?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_71"><text>As our brainiacs like to say - a dilemma...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_72"><text>Are you serious?! This... would... really solve the problem. True, can't trust our people with such a thing. Questions would start immediately. Maybe you? I have one nice artifact - "Mica". Do the job - it's yours.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_81"><text>I was joking. Solve your own problems.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_82"><text>I'll see what can be done.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_91"><text>I was joking too. Let's laugh together.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_dialog_92"><text>It would be better for everyone... Just don't take too long, what if someone finds them first.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_leader_corps_done_0"><text>No more of your dead people, they fell into an anomaly. The Zone took them.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_done_1"><text>Nobody saw?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_done_2"><text>No, seems not... Everything's clean. What were you offering?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_done_3"><text>Here's the artifact. I used it though... just a little bit.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_corps_done_4"><text>It's not that great.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_start_0"><text>About armor upgrade.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_start_11"><text>No problem, if you have spare artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_start_12"><text>Wait, when the installations are free, then we'll talk.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_start_21"><text>Got a couple simple artifacts. Can you soak the suit?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_start_22"><text>Got second level ones. Enough to soak the suit?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_start_23"><text>I wanted to clarify, just in case.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_start_3"><text>We'll do it. You walk around for a couple hours. I'll signal when everything's ready.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_start_4"><text>Then I'll take a walk.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_start_5"><text>Then I'll wait.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_done_0"><text>You said everything's ready?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_done_11"><text>Yes, the equipment worked without failures, the material structure accepted the anomalous quarks. So... See how long the effect lasts. But our research almost guarantees three days, maybe more. Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_done_12"><text>Ready... No, not quite. Generally, as a result of some malfunction the material structure was completely destabilized. Simply put - evaporated. Sorry, the methodology is too unrefined. Here's the... result.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_done_21"><text>Thanks. Three days guarantee, then. Can it be irradiated again?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_done_22"><text>Too bad. But can it be repeated?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_leader_upgrade_done_31"><text>Yes, absolutely possible. Bring more if you have spare artifacts.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_guard_dialog_start_4051"><text>Ah, right now. Medkits, bandages, anti-rads.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_guard_dialog_start_4052"><text>Ah, right now, I'll send it to your PDA.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_guard_dialog_start_501"><text>Marked One, always glad to see you.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_stalker_dialog_start_102"><text>Seems quiet...</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_stalker_dialog_start_107"><text>Maybe you're one of them?... Got in here... I won't give in to you!</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_stalker_dialog_start_204"><text>Who talked to you? Don't shake... Tell me properly...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_baze_stalker_dialog_start_205"><text>You won't understand... You're like all the others... Blind...</text></string>

<string id="marsh_baze_stalker_dialog_start_301"><text>A-a-a-ah! Get away!!!</text></string>

<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_101"><text>Hello, young man. I see life has been harsh to you.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_102"><text>Hello... Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, I don't remember all my life. Trying to find at least some thread from the past.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_103"><text>Judging by the scars on your face, you've had a hard life... How should I address you?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_104"><text>For now my name is Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_105"><text>Well, Marked One, I hope you manage to recover all your memories. Can I help you with anything?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_1051"><text>I'd like that... You are, I believe, a biologist. Maybe you could explain to me why a person loses memory and how he can get it back?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_1052"><text>Complex question... Nobody really can properly explain yet how and where memory recording happens. And various memory phenomena like "super memory" or conversely - partial amnesia with complete consciousness preservation, are even harder to explain. There are, of course, theories and established opinions, but you're interested in specifics, namely your case, as I understand?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_1053"><text>Yes.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_1054"><text>That's exactly specifically how it was and what to do in your case, I can't tell you anything, and general reasoning won't help.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_106"><text>Well, clear... that nothing about memory is clear... even to you. Another question: as far as I heard, there used to be a secret stalker group base here?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_107"><text>It was a project to study Zone properties. Led by one Professor Lebedev. I learned about this place from him. He and his assistants apparently died... There was some desperate attempt to break through to the very heart of the Zone. Wouldn't want to speak ill of a fellow scientist, but such an adventure couldn't have succeeded... Yes... Well, colleague Sakharov takes a more cautious position, and I tend to approve of it.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_108"><text>Sorry to bother you, but are there any records left from previous inhabitants?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_109"><text>Records? Er, there were some papers. But they couldn't be useful to us, we have a somewhat different research direction. We study natural mutations manifesting in Zone conditions that lead to telepathic phenomena! As preliminary research shows, there's some radiation in whose field it's maintained...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_110"><text>Sorry, I... I need to go.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_201"><text>Young man... Marked One? Yes? How can I be useful to you?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_202"><text>Ivan Sergeevich, where are the records?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_203"><text>Records? What records? Ah! Lebedev's records... I thought it right to give them to my guide. He showed some interest in them, as he said: some information might help stalkers with the problem of finding a safe path to the center...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_204"><text>Where is this guide? And what's his name?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_205"><text>Where? I don't know, he left a couple weeks after we settled. Said he was going north... His name is... Slipped my mind... Phantom? No... Such light eyes... Ask our supply manager, he mainly dealt with him.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_206"><text>I'll ask. And another question: You mentioned Zone center. I've heard this not once. What's so important there that everyone so persistently seeks a way there?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_207"><text>If I had been there, I could answer you. There's a supposition that some super-artifact may be located there - the MONOLITH. There's also indirect data that some people protect this Monolith. From whom or what, unclear. And whether they're people, also unclear. Generally, Zone center is an area shrouded in mysteries, speculation and rumors. And like everything mysterious, it simultaneously attracts and frightens. Obviously, that's why such interest.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_208"><text>Yes... Mysteries, rumors... Would like to know why Strelok wanted to get there. Thank you, Ivan Sergeevich.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_start_dialog_301"><text>Marked One, how are your affairs?</text></string>

<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_gluzov_letter_dialog_0"><text>Ivan Sergeevich, I received a letter from your now probably former graduate student, Sergey Gluzov. He asked me to let you read it too.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_gluzov_letter_dialog_1"><text>Really? Curious. Seryozha and I corresponded by email the other day and he didn't mention sending me a message on paper. Let me see.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_gluzov_letter_dialog_21"><text>Here, please. There, on the back side, look...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_gluzov_letter_dialog_22"><text>Wait... where is it?! Sorry, professor, seems I left it somewhere... I'll be right back!</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_gluzov_letter_dialog_3"><text>So, what do we have here? Ah, we already discussed this over the network. Apparently the paper letter took a long time. My prot‚g‚ asks to provide you scientific assistance if you need it. Considering our long productive cooperation, I'm gladly ready to personally consult you on any questions and provide access to our research resources. Within reasonable limits, of course. In short, don't hesitate to ask. We'll do what we can.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_glav_ecolog_gluzov_letter_dialog_4"><text>Thank you, I'll definitely ask.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_0"><text>Ivan Sergeevich, I really need your help. I want you to conduct a scan of my consciousness psi-matrix. Professor Sakharov said the only place in the Zone where this procedure can be done is your camp.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_1"><text>Hm. This is... a very unexpected request. May I ask why you need it?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_2"><text>Long story. And I don't fully understand it myself, honestly. Professor Sakharov wants to conduct an experiment... with my participation. You'd probably better ask him for details yourself. So will you help me?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_31"><text>You see, young man, the scanner's working resource is almost completely exhausted and, properly speaking, it should have been sent for maintenance long ago, if not scrapped, but... Considering that Sergey Gluzov asked for you, I think we can conduct one more procedure. Only I'll have a counter-request for you.\nA few days ago I spoke with my friend who was about to leave the Zone after a three-month shift in the area that stalkers usually call Ivankovsky District Center. And he told me an interesting story...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_32"><text>You see, young man, the scanner's working resource is almost completely exhausted and, properly speaking, it should have been sent for maintenance long ago, if not scrapped, but... I'm ready to meet you halfway if you agree to do us a return favor.\nA few days ago I spoke with my friend who was about to leave the Zone after a three-month shift in the area that stalkers usually call Ivankovsky District Center. And he told me an interesting story...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_4"><text>You know, Ivan Sergeevich, every time I hear about an unprecedented, incredible, most curious story told to someone, then, as a rule, I'm later asked to go to hell and back to check how true that story was. Uh... sorry for interrupting. Please continue.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_5"><text>Ahem... yes, so I'll continue.\nThe scientific expedition camp there is set up practically within city limits and located on a hill from which all surroundings are perfectly visible, including the sports ground at the former school. For some time now a strange creature has begun appearing on it at night. My colleague repeatedly observed it through night vision when standing guard. At first glance, it's an ordinary bloodsucker, but its behavior is completely atypical for this species...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_6"><text>And what's so unusual about its behavior? Does it sing drunk old pop songs and dance naked under the moon?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_7"><text>What? Ah! You're joking. No. It just stands, frozen motionless. And it can remain in this position for hours, usually until dawn. One might assume the creature sleeps or fell into some kind of anabiosis, but there are two substantial objections. Ordinary bloodsuckers always prefer to arrange lairs for sleeping in sheltered, dark and humid places. Most often in basements, abandoned outbuildings or caves, but certainly not under open sky. And the second point - during sleep they almost always activate the camouflaging properties of their skin to avoid being caught off guard by a larger predator or human who accidentally wanders into their lair.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_8"><text>Hm. Indeed, ordinary bloodsuckers don't behave like that. These cunning creatures are always cautious, but here... Don't even know. How can I help? Go observe it personally? And what will that give? I don't understand your affairs at all. Especially since there, in the district center, you have scientific personnel, let them deal with this strange case.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_9"><text>Who has "you"? Our institute has no relation to the group working in Ivankovsky District Center. Apparently you misunderstood me. But even if I had the right to give orders to colleagues there, I have no moral right to send them on such a risky enterprise. You, I assume, know that the research camp in the district center is protected by special installations that repel various evil? Expedition members try not to leave the radius of these installations without extreme necessity. You understand yourself - places there are extremely dangerous.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_10"><text>Well, yes. And therefore you'll have no moral anguish if you contract this job to an outsider, namely me. Yes, yes, I know I'm experienced, prepared, have danger sense and good equipment... and so on. Heard it many times. I'm used to the fact that we stalkers are like expendable material for scientists, no big loss if something happens.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_11"><text>But listen, Marked One, you just listed the most significant arguments that push scientists in such cases to choose stalkers rather than, say, military. Don't you find them convincing?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_12"><text>I do, I do... Just leaves a bad taste, as they say. Alright, tell me specifically what you want me to do?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_13"><text>Thank you for understanding. So, as you've already guessed, I'd like you to observe that strange creature from as close distance as possible. If you're convinced it shows no activity, doesn't react to external stimuli, for example, noise or bright flashlight light, generally poses no danger, then try to approach closely and examine it carefully. I have no idea what might happen and how the creature will react to your approach, so I ask you to be extremely careful and act according to circumstances. The most ideal outcome would be to get some biological tissue sample from this creature, but I don't even dare hope for that, so I'm ready to be satisfied with just a verbal description of what you see. That's essentially it.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_14"><text>Hope it doesn't end with the creature attacking me and having to shoot it. Can't give any guarantees, don't take offense.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_151"><text>Well, reasonable. If it turns out this creature is an ordinary bloodsucker, just with deviant behavior, and it attacks you, then I'd be quite satisfied if you kill it and cut off its tentacles, whatever condition they're in.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_152"><text>Well, reasonable. If it turns out this creature is an ordinary bloodsucker, just with deviant behavior, and it attacks you, then I'd be quite satisfied if you kill it and cut off its tentacles, whatever condition they're in.\nBut in this case I'd like to conduct a series of comparative tests, for which I'll need tissue samples from ordinary bloodsuckers - the same tentacles will do fine. I think three will be enough. Only I earnestly ask you to deliver them in condition suitable for further work, without signs of rot.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_start_dialog_16"><text>Deal. I'll go pack for the trip, and you prepare your machinery.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_done_dialog_0"><text>Had a chance to observe that creature that settled on the sports ground in Ivankovsky District Center...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_done_dialog_1"><text>Excellent news! Tell me quickly what you saw! Did you manage to get something... material?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_done_dialog_2"><text>What's to tell... At first everything was as you described: a bloodsucker stands near the basketball hoop, looks mature, but nothing unusual, just doesn't move, like rooted to the ground. So I started getting closer - zero reaction. Then I approached closely, started examining more carefully, touched it... And it suddenly roared and collapsed to the ground like it was cut down. After a few seconds something like dark haze gathered over the body. When it dispersed, only a strange jaw remained on the ground, like from a bloodsucker but not quite, a bit different. I took it with me as you asked. Oh, here's more: a couple of its kin came running to the death roar, quite ordinary ones. But that's nothing, I'm alive as you see.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_done_dialog_31"><text>Pure mysticism - no other way to put it. Glad you're whole and that you managed to get biological material, we'll have something to work on. Go down to the first floor and give your find to graduate student Gusko. He'll instruct you about the scanning, I'll warn him now.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_done_dialog_32"><text>Pure mysticism - no other way to put it. Glad you're whole and that you managed to get biological material, we'll have something to work on. By the way, you didn't forget about the second part of our agreement? Did you bring tentacles from ordinary bloodsuckers? If yes, then go down to the first floor and give your finds to graduate student Gusko. He'll instruct you about the scanning, I'll warn him now.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_psy_scan_task_done_dialog_4"><text>I understand, professor. All the best.</text></string>
<string id="tex_psy_scan_ask_article"><text>Head of the scientific expedition from Swamp asks to observe a strange creature that recently began appearing at night on the sports ground at the former school in Ivankovsky District Center, and tell about what was seen. It would also be highly desirable to get tissue samples from this creature. In return, the scientists will conduct a psi-matrix scan of my consciousness, which should help Professor Sakharov find a way to erase the Monolith psycho-coding imposed on my personality.</text></string>
<string id="tex_psy_scan_ask_more_article"><text>In addition to the scientists' request to observe the strange creature in Ivankovsky District Center, I also need to bring them 3 bloodsucker jaws for some comparative tests in "condition suitable for further work". Not too rotten, in other words.</text></string>

<string id="esc_bio2_dialog_0"><text>Do you know about anyone?</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio2_dialog_1"><text>Well, not without that... Got something to wet the throat? My tongue's dried out... Well, don't keep me waiting... pour...</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio2_dialog_11"><text>More? Get out a bottle, pour, maybe I'll remember someone else...</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio2_dialog_21"><text>Pour, pour... Like you agreed... Alright, let's go...</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio2_dialog_22"><text>Don't have any with me... Talk later...</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio2_dialog_3"><text>Well now, words won't get stuck in my throat...</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio2_dialog_4"><text>Interesting, who else do you know about?</text></string>
<string id="esc_bio2_dialog_5"><text>Well alright, I'm off...</text></string>

<string id="esc_lager_generator_201"><text>Greetings. Heard about your exploits. Cool, nothing to say.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_202"><text>Not so cool... Why are you running circles?</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_203"><text>On duty... Watching our generator so it doesn't stall. Add oil, fuel... Also charging batteries, if needed - bring them over. A few rubles and your battery's like new energizer...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_204"><text>Where do you get fuel?</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_205"><text>There are places... In the Gut you can try to pump some. In Swamp there's a small refinery, right on an oil well. And how many old gas stations are left in the Zone. Guys sometimes bring fuel canisters, we thank them accordingly with what we have. True, lately it's been tight. In the Gut, at the gas station, monsters settled. They say they even saw a bloodsucker there. In Swamp the military set up a post at the old refinery. Generally, if there's opportunity, drag some gasoline, we'll reward you. In the Gut, at the gas station, middle pump. Stalkers said you can still get 76-octane gas from there.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_206"><text>How to bring it? In my palms?</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_207"><text>I have empty canisters, if needed, take them... Only... You understand, anything could happen... You're gone - canister's gone, and Sidor constantly nags that canisters are unprofitable to haul from the mainland... So preferably leave a deposit, couple thousand rubles.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_208"><text>Alright, I'll think, maybe I can help somehow...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_401"><text>Marked One! What brings you here?</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_421"><text>I got some fuel...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_4311"><text>Thank you... Choose a present. Got ammo, grenades, food, vodka, medicine...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_431101"><text>Need 9x18 ammo.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_431102"><text>Need 5.45x39 ammo.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_431103"><text>Need 7.62x39 ammo.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_431104"><text>Need 12K ammo.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_431105"><text>Need VOG-25 grenades.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_431106"><text>Could use some food.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_431107"><text>Give me vodka!</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_431108"><text>Need medkits.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_431109"><text>Give me anti-rads.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_4312"><text>And here's money from us. Not much, of course, but something... Your gasoline will last us a day. So bring more tomorrow.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_4313"><text>Yeah, not much... I'll think next time if it's worth getting involved.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_4411"><text>Uh... We haven't run out of gas you brought last time. And the small rewards finished. Come back later... Yeah?</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_4412"><text>Where do I put this stuff now? They'll dump it, and carrying it around... Damn!</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_422"><text>Going somewhere, give me a little canister, maybe I'll get lucky with fuel.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_432"><text>Wouldn't want to remind, but the deposit... Couple thousand...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_4421"><text>No problem, here...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_4422"><text>Screw that, figure it out yourselves...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_452"><text>Yeah, I'll return it... Here's the canister... In Dark Valley, I think, the last pump still works.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_462"><text>I'll figure it out...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_423"><text>Just decided to check on you slackers.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_4231"><text>Ah... Well suit yourself...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_424"><text>Need to get water, got any?</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_4241"><text>Yeah, still some in the washbasin, filled it recently. Got money? For our needs?</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_4242"><text>Listen, you're getting on my nerves! I said - pay! Got money or not?</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42411"><text>Yeah I got it, here's your rubles...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42412"><text>Got a bottle of vodka, will you take it?</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42421"><text>Give it! After yesterday can't clear my head... At least I'll fix my health!</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_424211"><text>Take it! Well what about clean water? You understand - can't clean your peepers with vodka...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42413"><text>Got an energy drink here, take it...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_424131"><text>Alright! Give me your energy drink, my mouth's dried out...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_424311"><text>What, partied yesterday? Here...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_424312"><text>Uh... I need it myself.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_424132"><text>Choke on your energy drink! Give me cash...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_424133"><text>What a cheapskate...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42414"><text>For money I'd rather use vodka!</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_424111"><text>That's right... You can fill up, washbasin's in the basement.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_4241111"><text>In the basement, you say? Well alright...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42422"><text>Go to hell! After yesterday can't stand looking at it, head's splitting, and you...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_424212"><text>Well you should fix your health then!..</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_425"><text>My battery died...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42511"><text>No problem! Your money, our electricity. I got fully charged ones!</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42512"><text>No problem! Your money, our electricity. I got fully charged ones! Like I said: can give a charged one for two dead ones or pay coin!</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42513"><text>Our gasoline's running low, only emergency reserve left. Boss ordered to save electricity, so either bring a fuel canister or wait for others to bring some.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42514"><text>Oh, like that! Got you...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42521"><text>What comedians! Joker on joker! Here's the money...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42522"><text>Don't have money! Spent it on repairs...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42523"><text>Where'd I get that much! Can't save up enough money!</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42524"><text>Let's do it for two batteries. Here they are.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42531"><text>Not a joker, just a cheerful person. Here's a fully charged one. Safe travels...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42534"><text>Everything's normal. Here's a fully charged one. Safe travels...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42541"><text>Alright, see you...</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42533"><text>You should understand - you're a lucky, experienced stalker. Look how much you've collected. These rubles are like paper to you. But there are newbies... They have fewer opportunities, so we don't ask so much from them. Remember yourself - you weren't charged much at first either. Don't think only about yourself.\nBut if it seems like a lot, let's agree like this: you give me two dead batteries - I give you one charged. All fair and square.</text></string>
<string id="esc_lager_generator_42543"><text>Fair and square... I'd say... I'll think about it.</text></string>

<string id="bar_stalker_disel_101"><text>Greetings... What wind brings you? Don't think we know each other?</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_102"><text>Hello... Shame we don't know each other, I'm Marked One, heard of me?</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_1031"><text>Marked One? Don't think I heard... If you have business at the bar, then move along. I'm busy right now.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_1032"><text>Marked One?! I heard you helped Bes at Garbage?</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_1041"><text>Aren't there too many guards, poking gun barrels in your face at every step.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_1042"><text>Yes, that happened...</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_1051"><text>I'm not really a guard, I watch the power. Month ago flew into an anomaly, a "Burner". Almost burned all my guts, now can't run three steps. Made a deal with Barkeep: I ensure uninterrupted generator operation, charge batteries for stalkers, trade clean water by the glass, and he supplies me everything for normal life. Whoever brings gasoline, I pay them.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_1052"><text>Bes pulled me out of "Burner" and carried me on his back to Bar. So I owe him my life. Accept this small token of gratitude for your help to him.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_1062"><text>Didn't expect that, thanks. How are you? What do you do?</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_1072"><text>I watch the power. After getting into an anomaly and almost burning all my guts, can't run three steps. Made a deal with Barkeep: I ensure uninterrupted generator operation, charge batteries for stalkers, trade clean water by the glass, and he supplies me everything for normal life. Whoever brings gasoline, I pay them.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_108"><text>I see... Where's the nearest gas station?</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_109"><text>In Dark Valley, heard of it. There, at the old gas station, mostly those who are on good terms with the local brotherhood fill up. Need a canister once a day. If you bring one, you can get medicine, various ammo... even grenades available now. So hurry up.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_401"><text>Hi, Marked One! How's life?</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_421"><text>I managed to get some gasoline.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_4311"><text>Oh! Thank you... What would you like from society? Got ammo, grenades, food, medicine...</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_431101"><text>Need 9x19 ammo.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_431102"><text>Need 5.45x39 ammo.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_431103"><text>Need 7.62x39 ammo.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_431104"><text>Need 12K ammo.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_431105"><text>Need RGD-5 grenades.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_431106"><text>Could use some food.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_431107"><text>Give me M406 grenades.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_431108"><text>Need medkits.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_431109"><text>Give me anti-rads.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_4312"><text>Well here you go... This gasoline will last us a day. So bring more tomorrow, you're welcome.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_4313"><text>Heh, alright, maybe I'll bring more...</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_4411"><text>Sorry, we don't need fuel right now. We haven't run out of gasoline you brought last time. So bring some later...</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_4412"><text>Later? Well... We'll see what happens later.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_422"><text>Got any empty canisters?</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_432"><text>Actually I do, but better leave a deposit... Three thousand...</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_4421"><text>Three? Alright, no problem, here...</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_4422"><text>Three thousand?! I changed my mind...</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_452"><text>Don't worry, bring back the canister and I'll return your thousands... Here you go...</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_462"><text>Yeah, don't worry, everything will be fine.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_423"><text>Fine, heading to Bar...</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_424"><text>Got charged batteries?</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_42411"><text>Of course I do,</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_42412"><text>Sorry, tight situation with fuel for generator right now. Nobody's brought gasoline for a while, so temporarily not charging batteries. You'll have to wait, or go to that gas station in Valley yourself.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_42413"><text>Damn... I'll think about it.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_42522"><text>I'll drop by a bit later.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_42421"><text>Alright, agreed, here's an old battery and I'm paying cash.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_42422"><text>I'm tight on cash, later...</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_42431"><text>Everything's fine. Here, take the battery. Don't mind that it's a bit scratched, but fully charged. Come by again if you need anything.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_42441"><text>Good. See you.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_425"><text>Can I get some water?</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_435"><text>Why not... You can</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_4451"><text>Alright, money's not much, here...</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_4452"><text>Hm... For a flask of water? I'd rather fill up from a puddle.</text></string>
<string id="bar_stalker_disel_455"><text>You can fill up. Only I don't recommend drinking this water.</text></string>

<string id="red_forest_lesnik"><text>Huntsman</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_101"><text>Greetings, wanderer, seeking happiness or running from misfortune?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_102"><text>And health to you. Probably running from happiness.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_103"><text>Is that so? Happens... What should I call you, runaway.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_104"><text>They call me Marked One. Can I ask you something?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_105"><text>Ask away, of course.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_106"><text>What do you do?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_107"><text>Me? Wanted to check on grandpa, he was a forest ranger here in his time. Watched over this reserve and refused to leave. My father, when he was dying, asked me to find out what happened to him. I was just a bit too late, grandpa died not long ago. While I was getting here, I saw all kinds of things and decided to continue grandpa's work - watching over this forest. I make sure too many beasts don't breed, shoot the most violent and fierce ones.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_108"><text>Hm... What do you live on?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_109"><text>I trade my hunting trophies to passing stalkers. I don't need much, a bottle of vodka for warmth, and some ammo in reserve.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_201"><text>Want something else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_202"><text>Haven't heard about Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_203"><text>Strelok? I didn't meet him, but people talked about such a guy. All kinds of rumors go around. Some say he's a hero among heroes, others that he was a scumbag. Who to believe? Don't know... One very persistent rumor went around for a while that he, Strelok, was here and hid some very unusual artifact nearby. Eccentrics rushed into the forest. Practically nobody returned. That's probably all I know about Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_204"><text>Well, I see. Then, farewell.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_301"><text>Eternal wanderer? From good or for good?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_3021"><text>Want to acquire some monster parts.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_3022"><text>Just dropped by for a visit.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_304"><text>Thanks for dropping by, rest, warm up.\nMaybe you need some beast parts?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_start_dialog_303"><text>Well, I got plenty of that stuff.</text></string>

<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_0"><text>Can you be more specific? What exact parts, and for how much.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_1"><text>See for yourself, got tails from ordinary mutts, got pseudodog ones, bloodsucker tentacles, flesh eyes. Not even mentioning boar legs - three bunches for a ruble. Only sometimes they're not first freshness, nowhere to store them. Heh-heh... As for payment - vodka and ammo. Ammo better for shotgun, buckshot there, bullets or canister shot... In short, tell me what you need, and we'll agree on price.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_7"><text>You know my assortment... What else do you need?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_21"><text>Interested in a blind dog tail.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_22"><text>I'll take a pseudodog tail.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_23"><text>Need a boar hoof.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_24"><text>Need a flesh eye.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_25"><text>What will you take for a bloodsucker tentacle?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_31"><text>Mutt's little tail? Two packs of buckshot for one, bottle of vodka - two...</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_412"><text>I got buckshot.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_414"><text>Here's a bottle of forty-proof.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_415"><text>I'll probably come back later...</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_512"><text>Well, here's this tail, need anything else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_514"><text>You made me happy... Take a couple... Maybe need something else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_61"><text>No, nothing else needed.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_62"><text>I'm thinking... Let's take another look.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_32"><text>Pseudodog? Good tails from them are rare and accordingly harder to get... For each tail I'll ask either five packs of buckshot, or three canister shots, or three bottles.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_422"><text>I got buckshot.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_423"><text>I'll pour canister shot.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_424"><text>Here are your bottles.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_522"><text>Ammo is good! Here's this tail, need anything else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_523"><text>Well, here's this tail, need anything else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_524"><text>You made me happy... Maybe need something else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_33"><text>Boar leg? They're heavily hit by radiation... Boars are hard to kill, tough bastards and dangerous. Let's do this: for one hoof you give me three packs of buckshot or two canister shots... Or couple bottles for couple hooves. Tit for tat sort of.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_432"><text>I got buckshot.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_433"><text>Giving canister shot.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_434"><text>Here's a couple forty-proof.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_532"><text>Thanks for buckshot! Here's the hoof, need anything else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_533"><text>Well, here's the boar leg, need anything else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_534"><text>You made me happy... Maybe need something else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_34"><text>There's been few flesh lately, they're tasty - so they get killed as soon as spotted. Their eyes, they say, help with many ailments... Let's do this: for each eye of these pseudo-pigs you give me five packs of canister shot, or three bullets... Or three bottles of "Cossacks".</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_442"><text>I got canister shot.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_443"><text>Giving bullets.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_444"><text>Here they are, forty-proof.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_542"><text>Thanks for canister shot! Here's the eye, need anything else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_543"><text>Well, here's the flesh eye, need anything else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_544"><text>You made me happy... Maybe need something else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_35"><text>Bloodsuckers, in my opinion, are the most dangerous creatures in the Zone. While you kill one, you can become dinner for them 10 times yourself. Let's do this: for a tentacle of these monsters you give me 100 canister shots or 50 bullets... Or half a crate of vodka.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_452"><text>I got plenty of canister shot.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_453"><text>Take the bullets.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_454"><text>Here, take the vodka.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_552"><text>Thanks for bullets! Here it is - tentacle, need anything else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_553"><text>Well, here's the bloodsucker appendage, need anything else?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_trade_dialog_554"><text>You made me happy... Maybe need something else?</text></string>

<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_101"><text>So what, pal, don't mind your health?</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_102"><text>Your pals in the ravine are finishing off a horse... My health is my business...</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_103"><text>Chill, bro, I'm with all respect... Our crew set up a den here, so you ain't in charge here. You come to us nice - and we're cool... Get it?</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_104"><text>Don't try to intimidate me, what's this all about anyway?</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_105"><text>Feisty... Who are you anyway? I see - experienced guy, if you made it this far...</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_106"><text>Yeah, experienced... Marked One, if anyone doesn't know...</text></string>
<!--<dont_has_info>atp_bandit_pda_done</dont_has_info> -->
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_1071"><text>I get it, can do business with you, Marked One... So, wanna get respect from our bros, show you ain't a cheapskate - give a good artifact to the common fund, a good one, you can keep the crap for yourself... You get it?</text></string>
<!--<has_info>atp_bandit_pda_done</has_info>-->
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_1072"><text>Oh! Damn... You're Marked One? That very one? You're the one who helped the bros with that job in the Gut? Well... You're really... Anyway, I'd let you through anyway, but Bold might bust my face for such a thing... Maybe you got some artifact? Give it and pass through. You get it?</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_1081"><text>Now you'll get it from me... Nine grams in the gut.</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_1082"><text>Is that so? We-e-ell... Here. Second level artifact.</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_1083"><text>Got a third level artifact. Take it.</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_1084"><text>Feel sorry for you, weirdo... Here, take this dummy.</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_1085"><text>Hm... Alright, got a simple artifact.</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_1086"><text>What if I don't have artifacts?</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_1091"><text>Business talk! Go down the road, our guys sit near the bridge... Drop by Bold, let him take a look at you.</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_1092"><text>You gotta understand. Can't just let you through. That's what I'm posted for. So you turn around then.</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_110"><text>Interesting, what kind of Bold is that?</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_201"><text>A-a-ah! It's you again, Marked One... Gonna negotiate or what?</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_202"><text>Ain't you tired of sitting like a dog on a chain yet?</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_203"><text>Listen, let's do this: either you pay, or you get lost.</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_204"><text>You better remind me what you wanted?</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_2051"><text>Seems they speak truth that you got a draft in your head. Artifact no lower than second level and walk around without looking back. Got it?</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_2052"><text>Seems they speak truth that you got a draft in your head. Any artifact you don't mind, and walk around without looking back. Got it?</text></string>
<string id="red_scaut_dialog_start_301"><text>Hey there, man! Walk around calmly, since you didn't mind respecting the bros.</text></string>
<!-- ?????? -->
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_101"><text>So you, judging by your mug, are Marked One?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_102"><text>And you, judging by your boldness, are Bold?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_103"><text>Easy, man, no offense. We ain't measuring dicks here, trying to survive. Well and earn some, of course. You also crawled into this asshole for money, right?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_104"><text>I'm looking for a person, called Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_105"><text>Strelok? None of my business, of course, but he disappeared long ago. True, his buddy was here not long ago, Ghost...</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_106"><text>Why'd you go silent meaningfully? Finish what you started.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_107"><text>Don't rush. You know yourself, slower you go - further you'll be. Ghost - that's one hell of a fruit. Suspicious, secretive, can't get a word out of him. Shady in general. I sent a couple my eagles to tail him. Got curious what he's snooping around for.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_108"><text>What's to snoop around for? Probably just went on a hunt for artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_109"><text>Like hell! I've seen enough ordinary stalker-workers, can tell in a second who's going for loot and who's already returning with profit. Who can be pressured and who's better not to mess with. But with Ghost my instinct stayed quiet. Only one thing I understood about him - better not get involved with such a guy.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_110"><text>Well, what did your "eagles" manage to find out?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_111"><text>Hold your horses. Help me with one thing, I'll tell you. And even throw in something for your poverty.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_112"><text>Maybe I should tell you to get lost right away? What does your instinct say about that, huh, Bold?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_113"><text>Come on, don't get feisty. I can see the topic interested you. And my business is right here, in this little forest, won't take much time. I'll pay with an unusual artifact. How's that for an argument?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_114"><text>Don't feel like going into this forest unnecessarily. Let me think.</text></string>

<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_201"><text>So what, thinker, made up your mind?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_2021"><text>Outline your business, just shorter, without all the sayings.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_2022"><text>I refuse. I didn't sign up to be your errand boy.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_2031"><text>Our crew has one... patron. Gives tips on fat geese who trudge from Limansk this way on a secret path. Then I send guys to intercept. For this service we give back part of the taken loot. Our benefactor is even more secretive than Ghost in terms of conspiracy. Only contacts by shortwave radio, and only his own, left in a pre-prepared stash, always in different forest areas. Sends messages only by telegraph code.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_2032"><text>Then get out of here. And I advise looking over your shoulder often.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_204"><text>Some spy detective. His call sign isn't "007" by any chance? You ain't bullshitting me, Bold?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_205"><text>Ha! That's not all. He changes these radios once a week, drops us coordinates of roughly where to look for the stash, and where to leave loot for him.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_206"><text>Let's say I believe this story. What do you need from me? Can't find another stash by tip or what?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_207"><text>Worse. A family of mature bloodsuckers settled in the area. We tried to poke around, barely got away. They slashed Zhora Frozen so bad he came to the next day. And you seem like a pro in this area. Heard you supposedly eat mutants by the pack for breakfast...</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_208"><text>He heard... Generally, I take care of the bloodsuckers, you give me the story about Ghost and artifact. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_209"><text>Almost. Main thing for me is you bring the radio, everything else - your discretion. And one more thing, forgot to warn right away: time's tight, need to manage in half a day. If we miss the next communication session, our partner backs out of the deal.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_210"><text>That's how it always is. Such "details" are always saved for dessert. Ah, to hell with you! Tell me where to look for the stash.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_211"><text>Honestly, was ready for you to back out at the last moment. Let me mark the search area on your PDA map. Got it, where that is?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_212"><text>Yeah. Moving out, since you say time's tight.</text></string>
<string id="tex_borzyi_radio_article"><text>In exchange for a story about Ghost and a rare artifact, Bold asks me to bring him a radio from a stash, whose approximate location he marked on the map in my PDA.</text></string>
<!-- ????? -->
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_301"><text>Is that you... "hero"? Get moving, don't show yourself.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_302"><text>Don't get agitated, I'm not asking you to put me up here.</text></string>

<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_401"><text>Marked One, did you manage to find the radio?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_4021"><text>Hold on, gotta scout the situation first.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_4022"><text>Managed, managed. Hidden really well, of course. Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_403"><text>Excellent! So the rumors about you ain't lies...</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_404"><text>Let's skip the sentiment. I'm interested in specific information about Ghost and the promised payment.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_405"><text>No problem. Here's the artifact. Knowledgeable wanderers say it's a big rarity. Satisfied?\nBy the way, you interested in PDAs? Can throw in some quantity for currency checks.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_406"><text>Hm... Really, curious specimen. About PDA I'll keep in mind, not the time for it now.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_407"><text>As you wish, our job is to offer.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_start_dialog_501"><text>Our regards with a brush. How's life?</text></string>
<string id="red_sos_spot"><text>Here you should look for the stash with the radio for Bold</text></string>

<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_0"><text>Everything's fine. I came to you on business, to deliver a message from Borov.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_1"><text>Oh really? What, was he embarrassed to send his own bulls this time, decided to send an outside stalker? Anyone else I'd have plucked and beaten down to a child's voice, but you, Marked One, are a decent guy. You come to us with respect, we treat you the same. Borov guessed right with this. Alright, let's talk.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_2"><text>Here's the thing: Borov offers one last time to peacefully resolve your disagreements with him. What specifically it's about, I don't know, but I think you understand. In case of refusal... generally, he guarantees troubles for you personally. You can send an answer through me, or send one of your own, but first option is preferable for Borov. And better not to drag it out, Borov doesn't intend to wait long.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_3"><text>You say he didn't outline the essence of our "disagreements" to you, right?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_4"><text>Well... From his words I concluded that your crew interferes with Borov's "business", and you don't rush to recognize him as boss either.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_5"><text>That's all? Well, well...</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_6"><text>Deep in thought, I see. What should I pass back? Maybe come later, or you'll figure it out yourselves, without me?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_7"><text>Yeah, probably what to do with you. You know what, Marked One... Now I'll explain the whole layout to you step by step, you listen, and then we'll decide what's next.\nYou think Borov's just being reckless because we're his competitors? Hell no! About a week ago, as I managed to find out, they tipped him off that a group of scientists with a rare artifact was planning to move from Yantar to Tesla through Limansk, to conduct some experiment. He got busy fast and arranged to trade this artifact for something he really needs, after robbing the eggheads first, of course. The scientists never showed up in Limansk, and now they're demanding penalty from the pig, and threatening to put him on a counter, as I heard. Those people he contacted are serious. So Borov calculated the odds and decided to make us the fall guys. Like we cut the valuable artifact from the scientists, so they returned to their camp at Yantar, nothing left to catch. Generally, Borov sent his torpedoes. Apparently thought he'd load me like a sucker, would work out with half a kick, but he opened his mouth on the wrong guy...</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_8"><text>And what are you getting at? Let me guess. Now you'll say that you're actually not involved and the scientists with the artifact never appeared here, right? How do you even know such details about Borov's plans?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_9"><text>What, don't believe? Bold answers for his words! How... Where, where?! I got a loyal guy in Borov's crew, he signaled it. And I'm getting at this: no matter how Borov puffs up, no matter how he inflates his cheeks, we won't go under him. On the other hand, starting fights is also pointless. We need quiet here. It's easier for stalkers to part with some loot than to look for detours in this area. But shooting starts, and they'll quickly figure out that taking this road to Limansk costs more than it's worth.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_10"><text>And therefore...</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_11"><text>And therefore I want to smooth things over, appease Borov. Get the same artifact that the scientists were supposed to carry to Tesla, and pass it through you... as a surprise. Along with assurances of eternal friendship and all that. Ha-ha! Nothing, we're not proud. And he'll get his anyway, sooner or later.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_12"><text>Don't get it, why are you so cheerful?! It's a direct loss for you, and anyway... Alright, not my business. Finding an artifact, as I understand, you want to offer to me? What kind of artifact and "what will I get from this besides nothing", as they say in Odessa?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_13"><text>Ever heard of "Snow"? I managed to inquire: finding it in the Zone is practically impossible. Looks like ordinary "Moonlight", but has a special property - creates some anomaly, imagine that?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_141"><text>"Snow"... something familiar. Ah yes, I came across a way to transform... one artifact into this very "Snow". And even about activation there was something. Well, about how to make it create an anomaly.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_142"><text>"Snow"... no, don't recall. Where do you want me to look for it? You just said yourself that finding such in the Zone is almost impossible.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_151"><text>Sweet! So you won't have problems bringing me a couple "Snows"?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_152"><text>Use your brain! You're a stalker, should know: can't find it, make it. Or how do you guys say it? Ah, exactly - cook it. Who trades recipes, tell me? Or figure it out yourself? By the way, Toothy is hanging around Limansk right now at some guys' place. We better not show ourselves in the city now, you understand, or I'd have paid him a visit already. In short, I think you shouldn't have special problems finding out the recipe, cooking and bringing me a couple "Snows". Well, and you gotta figure out how they create anomalies.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_16"><text>What? Just now we were talking about one artifact! Why do you need two? And I still haven't heard anything about reward.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_17"><text>This is... Don't take offense, but I gotta be sure you brought exactly "Snow", not "Moonlight". Who knows, maybe you mixed up... Generally, on one you'll demonstrate how an anomaly is created, the second... The second will be a surprise for Borov. If you handle it, I'll tell the guys to let you pass from Limansk without payment from now on and personally throw in a dozen PDAs. Sound good?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_181"><text>Doesn't work. More hassle and costs than benefit. And anyway... Not sure it makes sense for me to continue playing peacemaker. Might end up between hammer and anvil, so let's you also not take offense. I delivered the message as asked, figure out the rest without me. And about what you told me, I won't say a word to anyone, of course, rest assured.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_182"><text>Seems fine, but on the other hand... I have doubts whether dragging your "surprise" to Borov is such a good idea. Better let me pass the answer in words, as originally intended.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_183"><text>Fine. I often travel through you guys to Limansk, so potential expenses will pay off quickly, and PDAs won't be extra, they can always be traded for something useful. Consider we have a deal. I'll return when I get the artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_192"><text>Then... Alright, then tell him this: let him go to hell with his offers. Tell him exactly that. And if any of his mutts shows up here again - we'll waste them. Got it all?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_start_dlg_202"><text>Uh... I thought... Got it, as you say.</text></string>
<string id="tex_borzyi_borov_quest_article"><text>Bold wants to make a surprise by passing Borov a rare and very important artifact "Snow" as a sign of peaceful intentions. Getting two pieces of said artifact (one for testing by demonstrating hidden properties) is offered to me. In return I get free passage through Bold's gang territory and a dozen PDAs as bonus.</text></string>

<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_have_dlg_0"><text>Greetings, Bold! I brought you a couple "Snows", as we agreed. Everything still stands, I hope? Would be unpleasant to learn at the last moment that you changed your mind. I spent quite a bit getting these artifacts, you see...</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_have_dlg_1"><text>What, you bullshitting? I ain't some backyard mutt to spout empty words. What's paid for should be swallowed. Well, let's see, show me.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_have_dlg_2"><text>Don't get so worked up. Here...\nOnly what's to look at? You know yourself they look like ordinary "Moonlight". And for "Snow" to create an anomaly, you need to perform certain actions on it.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_have_dlg_3"><text>For real. Then follow me. There's something like an abandoned bunker or whatever they call it in the military nearby... We'll watch your tricks there.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_have_dlg_4"><text>Lead the way.</text></string>

<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_check_dlg_0"><text>What now?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_check_dlg_11"><text>Stand over there, by the "Prepare Documents" sign. Then slowly, so I can see everything, start your "sorcery". When you finish, come over, we'll continue talking.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_check_dlg_12"><text>Well, what, everything went exactly as Mitrokha told me. Didn't bullshit me, the bastard. And how you waved your hands, I remembered, can repeat it... I mean, if I needed to... In short, I'm satisfied. Let's go back, we'll finish talking there.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_check_dlg_21"><text>Got it.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_check_dlg_22"><text>Let's go.</text></string>

<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_package_dlg_0"><text>Well, how did you like the demonstration? I got the impression you were more interested in how to activate "Snow" than the artifact itself.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_package_dlg_1"><text>You know what they do when something "seems"? I warned you I want to be sure this is the right artifact. That's it, don't fuck with my brain. Give me the second artifact here, now I'll... pack it carefully, attach a note for Borov, seal it good... from the too curious, and pass it to the delivery service. That is, to you, heh-heh.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_package_dlg_21"><text>Listen, Bold, this all looks... painfully suspicious somehow. Don't want to be the fall guy if something happens... I mean, I'm not accusing you of anything, of course, but how about you send someone else to Borov. And we'll renegotiate about the artifact and my payment differently...</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_package_dlg_22"><text>Fine, here's the artifact. Deal with it.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_package_dlg_31"><text>So you'd rush to Borov right away and spill your suspicions to him? Won't work. Eh, should've acted more subtly. Nothing personal, as they say, but you signed your own death warrant, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_package_dlg_32"><text>Go get some air for twenty minutes. Don't interfere with the creative process.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_package_dlg_4"><text>Ah, you bastard!</text></string>
<string id="tex_borzyi_borov_package_article"><text>Bold wants me to personally deliver a box with the "Snow" artifact, obtained by me, along with a cover note, to Borov in Limansk. It's supposed to be a surprise... Just not sure if it'll be a pleasant one.</text></string>

<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_delivery_dlg_0"><text>So, what about the package for Borov? Did you get it ready?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_delivery_dlg_11"><text>Yeah. Stuff this box in your backpack. See how it's sealed? Don't you dare open it. Borov will know if it was opened and won't be happy about it, trust me. I scribbled him a couple lines about this in the note. That's it, move out to Limansk. Then come back, I'll settle up as agreed.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_delivery_dlg_12"><text>Hold on. This ain't sending pickles from grandma to a beloved grandson. Here you need to show thoroughness so the client gets the full meaning... of the message.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_delivery_dlg_21"><text>I'll be quick. And you meanwhile pick out those PDAs for me that don't look completely dead.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_delivery_dlg_22"><text>Can't figure out what there is to fuss over so much...</text></string>

<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_reward_dlg_0"><text>Well, hi there, Bold. I delivered your package to Borov.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_reward_dlg_1"><text>Excellent! And how did it go... did he open it in front of you?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_reward_dlg_21"><text>Didn't open it. Asked if I knew what was inside. I answered that an artifact and a note. He said he'd look later, without extra eyes. I left, and when I checked on Borov's place later, turned out some unpleasantness happened, because of which his whole crew now dreams of stringing me up on the nearest lamppost. You were probably counting on such an outcome, right? I sensed a trick in this whole story from the beginning...</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_reward_dlg_22"><text>Everything's fine. Didn't open it. Asked if I knew what was inside. I answered that an artifact and a note. He said he'd look later, without extra eyes. That's all.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_reward_dlg_31"><text>Sweet! Even better that way... I mean... Ah, don't worry about it, in short. Job's done. You got respect from my crew. Walk to Limansk and back freely whenever you want. And take the PDAs, you earned them. Go on, see you later.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_borov_quest_reward_dlg_32"><text>Come on, don't whine. Did a good deed, consider it. Don't be mad I used you in the dark, but you turned up too conveniently. You got respect from my crew. Walk to Limansk and back freely whenever you want. And take the PDAs, you earned them. Go on, see you later.</text></string>

<string id="docent_PDA_luber_dialog_1"><text>Well I'm listening, what's the little problem? Can't carry artifacts? Too heavy?</text></string>
<string id="docent_PDA_luber_dialog_2"><text>Well yeah, something like that... I helped one Duty guy in Dark Valley. He says that thugs took his PDA, and there's information needed for everyone... Can you check if this PDA's frequency shows up anywhere? Here's the access code.</text></string>
<string id="docent_PDA_luber_dialog_3"><text>Not hard for me, but... Ah, alright! I'll help... One minute, let's see... There's a mark, but very weak, apparently batteries are almost dead. Near Research Institute "Agroprom", here by the swamp, see?</text></string>
<string id="docent_PDA_luber_dialog_4"><text>You're great... I'll repay you with loot somehow...</text></string>

<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_101"><text>Man, help me, I beg you by Christ and God...</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_1021"><text>Die, you scum!</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_1022"><text>Oh! Looks like my "client". You pocketed the Duty guy's PDA after their group got taken in the Valley? Think carefully. Say "no" - and I'll just stand aside and watch which beast gets to you first.</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_103"><text>No, I didn't take it, cross my heart! Stop! I know who has it... Help me, I'm in real bad shape... I'll tell you everything then, whatever you want!</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_1041"><text>So be it, I'll believe you. Here's a medkit.</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_1042"><text>I'm tight on medicine. I'll go look for some. Don't you dare croak while I'm gone!</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_1043"><text>I warned you? I warned you. Farewell.</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_105"><text>Oh... I'll never forget, pal, damn right I will... Thought that was it, Kirpich had run his last. But nah, we'll live some more. And for you, bro, I'll now do whatever you want.</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_106"><text>Yeah, yeah. I know the price of such vows of eternal friendship. Alright, not about that. I need the Duty guy's PDA, where did you put it?</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_107"><text>My partner's got it, Mikola Hornet. Left me here, the bastard. I'll kill the scumbag! We actually wanted to pass through here quietly along the ravine edge, but it didn't work out. A whole pack of cats came running, immediately tore my side, and my buddy ran for it. Then a pack of dogs showed up from somewhere and the beasts didn't care about me - they fought each other. And soon you showed up.</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_108"><text>Your adventures don't worry me much. Get to the point. Where to look for your Hornet?</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_109"><text>So this... I'm tellin' ya - he probably rushed to the eggheads at Swamp, not even an hour passed. Probably approaching their camp now, if he didn't get stuck boozing somewhere. And he planned to trade the device for booze with the scientists - that's the whole story. What else to do with this crap? I took it to look, thought there might be games or something, but it asks for password. Tried this way and that, entered passwords and all kinds of crap - won't let me in.</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_1101"><text>Yeah right... Real genius. Will keep telling me here: an hour to Swamp. Yeah, sure!</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_1102"><text>Yeah right... Real genius. What else useful do you have to say?</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_1111"><text>What, you really don't know about the path from here to Swamp? You walk straight south to the wire. Better not go over the hill, go around. That way you won't have to flash in front of the soldiers. Then along the wire turn right until you see a hole in it. Climb right there, and there's only one road. How to look for Hornet later - hell knows. Though... there's one idea actually.</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_1112"><text>What you wanna find out? How to look for Hornet in Swamp - hell knows. Though... there's one idea actually.</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_112"><text>Speak up, I'll listen.</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_1131"><text>So... I know the approximate place where part of our crew's common fund lies in Swamp. And Hornet knows, but exactly. I got a feeling he might rush there first and grab the loot for himself. And then tell the guys that I took everything. Why not? Convenient - a corpse won't tell the truth. But I'm alive! Generally, you go check our stash. If you're lucky, you'll catch Hornet there. Well, and if you don't run into him but the loot's there - take it all yourself. Better you get it than that bastard.\nYou know where the railway is in Swamp? And you seen the old destroyed platform? That's about where the cherished backpack is hidden.</text></string>

<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_114"><text>Sounds smart. You can do it when you want to. My advice: quit the "big road" and get smart. See you later, lucky one.</text></string>
<string id="agr_kirpich_start_dialog_201"><text>Bro, from the heart! Thought that was it, Kirpich had run his last. But nah, we'll live some more. You're my first pal now. I'll do whatever you want for you.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_oksana_start_dialog_252"><text>Where I saw him, there's nobody there anymore. Leave the Zone. You won't find him, and you'll die yourself.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_oksana_start_dialog_253"><text>No! I'll keep looking anyway! I have nobody left but him. Won't you help? I asked one good man, paid him. And these... transparent beasts attacked us... He just shouted: "Run!" Didn't even manage to get his weapon out... Horror!\nVlad sent me a letter, wrote that he's at Cordon, but there's no needed artifact there, and he's planning to go further to the center to search...\nHelp me get to this Cordon, and I'll manage from there myself. I'll pay, don't doubt it. I still have some money left...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_oksana_start_dialog_2041"><text>What do I need your money for? Alright, come what may. Can you run well?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_oksana_start_dialog_2042"><text>Listen, girl... I have my road, you have yours.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_oksana_start_dialog_205"><text>Run? I don't know, but I'll try... Where to run?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_oksana_start_dialog_206"><text>To Cordon, you asked for it yourself.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_oksana_start_dialog_207"><text>Alright, I understand. Should I follow you?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_oksana_start_dialog_208"><text>Yes, stay behind me, a bit apart, but don't fall behind too much. If something happens to me... Look here, here's a map. You and I will now move along the road east, reach the old mechyard and go south to the church. From there east again to the southern hamlet. And there's Cordon, understand?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_oksana_start_dialog_209"><text>Wait, I'll remember the way... So, from here east... then to the church... then... Got it, I understand.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_oksana_start_dialog_210"><text>Good girl. Let's move.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_oksana_start_dialog_301"><text>I didn't call you... go away...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_oksana_start_dialog_302"><text>Yeah, yeah...</text></string>

<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_101"><text>Greetings, stalker. Can we have a word? How should I address you, by the way?</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_102"><text>Hello. Marked One is my name. What did you want?</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_103"><text>We have a problem here, our guide is unconscious...</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_104"><text>What happened to him?</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_105"><text>We work with Ivan Sergeevich. He equipped a scientific expedition to study some peculiarities of Zone wildlife. According to some sources, a very unusual mutant appeared nearby. Stalkers call it a giant. Ivan Sergeevich was very interested and sent us to observe this specimen in natural, so to speak, conditions...</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_106"><text>Seems to me the opportunity didn't present itself.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_107"><text>Well... Generally, yes. Frol, our guide, undertook to lead us to where the giant was seen. When we reached here, he expressed the opinion that it was necessary to first scout the exact location of the lair independently. But something apparently happened there... How he managed to return, we don't know, but thirty meters from here we found him unconscious. We called for help, they'll come soon. But... Now we have a dilemma: time is passing, and the object of our interest might leave the operational zone where we conduct field research. When else will such a specimen wander into these parts...</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_108"><text>What do you need from me?</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_109"><text>Won't you agree to temporarily take on the functions of guide-guard? Of course, I don't promise special rewards, but I'm sure our expedition base has something that could ease the hard life of a stalker. And when help arrives, then we'll evacuate our permanent guide from here.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_1101"><text>You convinced me, smooth talker. Where do I need to lead you?</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_1102"><text>Let's do it later, I have unfinished business.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_111"><text>I'll mark it on your PDA map rather than explain in words where to go.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_112"><text>Smart thinking. Stay behind me and don't lag. Let's move.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_201"><text>So what, Marked One, will you help?</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_202"><text>With what?</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_203"><text>Did you forget? I asked you to guide me to the giant's lair.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_2041"><text>Ah, right! So where do you say I need to lead you?</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_2042"><text>I'm not ready for heroics. You manage without me.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_301"><text>We going or what?</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_302"><text>Yeah. Watch your sides. Plenty of mutants here.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_351"><text>Thanks for the help! I'll manage on my own from here. Drop by our base sometime when you get a chance. We'll find something to thank you with.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_352"><text>Alright, be more careful here...</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_hutor_start_dialog_401"><text>Go on, stalker. We'll manage somehow.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_botan2_start_dialog_101"><text>Hello, stalker. How's life?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_start_dialog_102"><text>Fine, what's this - sunbathing?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_start_dialog_103"><text>If only. We have a little problem, my colleague will explain in detail.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_start_dialog_104"><text>Alright, I'll talk to him.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_start_dialog_201"><text>My colleague needs help. Talk to him, please.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_start_dialog_202"><text>Yeah, yeah, yeah...</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_start_dialog_301"><text>Thank you for agreeing to help! When you're at our base, come by, we'll chat.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_start_dialog_302"><text>Alright, see you again, I think.</text></string>

<string id="gluzov_base_start_dialog_101"><text>Greetings! What brings you to us?</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_base_start_dialog_102"><text>I have business here.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_base_start_dialog_1031"><text>I remember your service, Marked One. A debt should be repaid. I talked with Ivan Sergeevich, and he told Pakhom to express gratitude to you on behalf of all of us in material, so to speak, form.\nSo you can talk to our supply manager.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_base_start_dialog_1032"><text>Well, go... about your business.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_base_start_dialog_201"><text>Greetings, Marked One, how's life?</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_base_start_dialog_301"><text>Marked One, finally! I was waiting for you.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_base_start_dialog_401"><text>Oh, Marked One! I was just thinking about you. Any news on finding natural artifacts?</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_base_start_dialog_501"><text>Well, hello. What brings you here?</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_base_start_dialog_601"><text>Oh, Marked One! I was just thinking about you. Any news on finding natural artifacts? Time's pressing, you know.</text></string>
<string id="gluzov_base_start_dialog_701"><text>Hi, buddy, glad to see you!</text></string>

<string id="pahom_botan1_senks_dialog_0"><text>Gluzov told me to have a word with you about some "material gratitude".</text></string>
<string id="pahom_botan1_senks_dialog_1"><text>Gluzov - that's the one who went to admire the giant? And I told Ivan Sergeevich, no need to let these boys work independently "in the field". They'll die - then we'll get dragged through courts... These students have no sense of self-preservation at all, they climb everywhere.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_botan1_senks_dialog_2"><text>That's true... Well, good that it ended well!</text></string>
<string id="pahom_botan1_senks_dialog_3"><text>Ah, youth, youth... Alright, you did a good deed. I'll try to provide you with what's in stock at minimal prices... Won't even spare ammo, though we have a shortage. Come by in a day or so, I need to do inventory and agree on discount prices for you with Ivan Sergeevich.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_botan1_senks_dialog_4"><text>Well, thank you.</text></string>

<string id="pahom_gluzov_letter_dialog_0"><text>Pakhom, I got your message. News came from Gluzov, as I understand?</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_letter_dialog_1"><text>Yeah. I heard our Seryoga made a sensation at some prestigious scientific conference. And you apparently helped him with materials for the report, right?</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_letter_dialog_2"><text>That happened. Nothing special really. Scientific materials for some, stalker routine for others. Plus or minus, of course.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_letter_dialog_3"><text>Come on, don't be modest. Your adventures for the sake of science are known to every idler among the scholarly community.\nHere's your letter. Ah, even makes me a bit envious. I got my last one about 5 years ago... and that was from my ex-wife's lawyer... Yeah.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_letter_dialog_4"><text>What's to envy? Be glad that at least bailiffs or tax people don't bother you with "letters of happiness". You have to find positive sides in everything.</text></string>

<string id="marsh_botan2_base_start_dialog_101"><text>Hello, stalker.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_base_start_dialog_1021"><text>Hi. Returned to base, then? I see your guide recovered too. Well, glad for you.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_base_start_dialog_1022"><text>Hi. Returned to base, then? How's your guide? What happened to him?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_base_start_dialog_1023"><text>And you take care too.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_base_start_dialog_1031"><text>Yeah, so I'd agree to work in the field again. And the guide, Frol, the Duty guys pulled him out from that hamlet. Their patrol happened to be nearby, well, they didn't refuse to help. By the way, talk to Frol, he has some business with you.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_base_start_dialog_1032"><text>Yeah, so I'd agree to work in the field again. And the guide, Frol, the Duty guys pulled him out from that hamlet. Their patrol happened to be nearby, well, they didn't refuse to help. Generally, Frol is resting for now, but should be back on his feet soon. By the way, talk to him later when you see him, he has some business with you.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_base_start_dialog_1041"><text>We already discussed his proposal. Alright, I'll go. See you, science.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_base_start_dialog_1042"><text>Good, I'll talk to him. See you, science.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_base_start_dialog_301"><text>Sorry, stalker, I'm busy right now.</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_base_start_dialog_302"><text>Alright. Just tell me why everyone's looking at me with such hostility - Pakhom, Demyan, the others?</text></string>
<string id="marsh_botan2_base_start_dialog_303"><text>As if you don't guess yourself. You let down our Seryoga, Gluzov - people already know. So trust stalkers with something more serious than getting a couple dog tails after this.</text></string>

<string id="frol_task_dialog_0"><text>Greetings, Frol, how's your health?</text></string>
<string id="frol_task_dialog_1"><text>You know me? How?</text></string>
<string id="frol_task_dialog_2"><text>Saw you lying unconscious at the northern hamlet. I'm Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="frol_task_dialog_3"><text>Ah! Marked One! Sorry, didn't recognize you. The graduate slackers told me about you. You seem like a decent guy, not like some others. Wanted to talk to you about one thing.\nWhen I went to scout the road to the giant's lair, I stumbled upon a stalker's corpse on the way. He had some documents, and among them a map with one marked place. I think it's a reserve stash of the group that was here before. They called themselves "Clear Sky". The stash isn't far, but... I'm not much of a Zone walker yet - the Duty guys dragged me here, thanks to them.\nHow about you? Don't want to take a look at what's there?</text></string>
<string id="frol_task_dialog_4"><text>I can take a look, why not. What's your interest?</text></string>
<string id="frol_task_dialog_5"><text>Judging by the papers, there should be some foreign weapon there. And a stalker came to the camp the other day who was just interested in Western samples. He needs a spare barrel, specifically for 5.56. Promised big money to both Pakhom and Sylvester if they'd agree to sell him something in this caliber. But where would such weapons be here? Tomorrow he should visit us again, to trade provisions for monster guts. Seems like he's preparing for a long expedition. So I thought, if the stash really exists and there's a suitable barrel in it... Why not try to sell it if it's not too late. And I'll have something to pay you with too. You won't be left empty-handed, I promise!</text></string>
<string id="frol_task_dialog_61"><text>I see. Good, tell me where to look for that place.</text></string>
<string id="frol_task_dialog_62"><text>No, Frol, I have more important things to do.</text></string>
<string id="frol_task_dialog_7"><text>Let me show you on the PDA map. It should be west of the mechyard, there's also a small pond, approximately in this place... Just try to manage within a day, or the potential buyer will go on a raid. Oh, one more thing: if there's a weapon there, please make sure it's in sellable condition. Time has passed after all. Clean it, oil it if needed. Otherwise it'll be awkward...</text></string>
<string id="tex_frol_task"><text>Frol asked to find a Clear Sky stash in the northwestern part of Swamp and bring him a Western weapon sample that should be lying there. If the weapon turns out to be in poor condition, it should be fixed up</text></string>

<string id="frol_reward_dialog_0"><text>Hi, Frol! I found the stash we talked about.</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_1"><text>Really? And what was there?</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_2"><text>Nothing special: papers, ammo and a Swiss assault rifle - "SIG SG 552 Commando". Interested?</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_3"><text>"SIG SG 552 Commando"? That's 5.56 caliber, right? Will you give it to me? The "buyer" should come soon - he just contacted Pakhom through his palmtop.</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_41"><text>Take it, don't mind.</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_42"><text>You know, Frol, I thought about it... I could use this weapon myself.</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_51"><text>Thank you! Now it's my turn to give out favors. You know the way to Forgotten Village?</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_52"><text>Well, as you wish... To hell with that rifle.</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_61"><text>Forgotten Village? Don't know... Why Forgotten?</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_62"><text>Forgotten Village? Yeah, I know how to get there.</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_71"><text>Because nobody knows what it used to be called... Someone said "forgotten" once, and it stuck among stalkers. Generally, beyond the farthest hamlet from here, the northern one, there's a gap in the wire, that's where the path starts. I'm putting a mark on your PDA here.</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_711"><text>Northern hamlet, hole in the wire, path... yeah, got it.</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_721"><text>So listen further! When you get to Forgotten Village, look around the abandoned store, I dropped a backpack somewhere there. Hid an artifact and hunting carbine in it - was too heavy to carry. You can take it, for your good deed. Oh, and this artifact isn't ordinary. When you wear it on your belt, cats don't bother you at all with their purring that brings on drowsiness.</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_722"><text>So listen further! When you get to Forgotten Village, head to the part that stands on high ground. Look there in one of the buildings - don't remember exactly which one, I was drunk - there should be a backpack. I hid an artifact and hunting carbine in it - was too heavy to carry. You can take it, for your good deed. Oh, and this artifact isn't ordinary. When you wear it on your belt, cats don't bother you at all with their purring that brings on drowsiness.</text></string>
<string id="frol_reward_dialog_8"><text>Thanks! When I'm there - I'll definitely check your tip.</text></string>

<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_101"><text>Stalker... here I sit...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_102"><text>Yeah, I see, what are you doing here, soldier?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_103"><text>Met a friend here, dead... We were in training together, came here together... And now he lies there and nothing surprises him anymore. What, leave him? For dogs to eat? Eh, Kostyan... We thought after the army we'd go to Kiev together, enter university.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_104"><text>Eh, boys, why do they send you here... Alright, what's your name?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_105"><text>Sanya, Private Ryzhov... Was... I ran away from the unit, wanted to get out of the Zone with one guy. Who are you?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_1061"><text>I'm a stalker, Marked One. Right, this Zone is no place for people... Leave while you're still alive...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_1062"><text>I'm a stalker, Marked One. Listen, was it you who was hanging around the swamp with that rat catcher?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_201"><text>Marked One... And I'm here...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_2022"><text>Yeah, I see... Listen, was it you who was hanging around the swamp with that rat catcher? Sanya, right?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_2021"><text>Enough already, I'm telling you: get out of here while you're alive...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_2032"><text>Well yeah, so what?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_2031"><text>I can't leave Kostyan here. I think he needs to be buried, not like a dog, but properly...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_2041"><text>How's that?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_2051"><text>There's an old church nearby, with a cemetery... Need to take the body there... Will you help me? It's hard alone - too many creatures around...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_20611"><text>Carry him? Alright, I'll help. How do we do this?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_20711"><text>Let's do it like this, I'll cover and show the way, and you carry Kostyan... It's not far, we'll manage in a couple hours.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_20811"><text>Well then, let's move...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_20612"><text>Sorry, friend, I'll go about my business.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_20712"><text>E-eh, go then, I'll manage myself...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_20812"><text>See you...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_20421"><text>I saw him at the Agroprom swamp, he's waiting, has no food... And you sit here...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_20422"><text>He says you know the patrol scheme at Research Institute "Agroprom"?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_20521"><text>I can't leave Kostyan here. I think he needs to be buried, not like a dog, but properly... And Kolyan can wait a bit...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_20621"><text>Properly? How's that?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_20522"><text>I know, I wrote them down. I can help you, of course, but you help me too... I can't leave Kostyan here. I think he needs to be buried, not like a dog, but properly...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_20622"><text>Properly? How's that?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_20722"><text>There's an old church nearby, with a cemetery... Need to take the body there... Help me, it's hard alone - too many creatures around...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_208221"><text>Carry him? Alright, I'll help. How do we do this?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_208222"><text>Don't try to confuse me, speak up!</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_209222"><text>Go to hell! You scared me...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_209221"><text>Let's do it like this, I'll cover and show the way, and you carry Kostyan... It's not far, we'll manage in a couple hours...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_301"><text>Now along the path to Swamp... Ready? Where's Kostik's body?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_3021"><text>Here he is... Come on, let's move...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_3022"><text>Here it is... Let me rest a bit...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_3023"><text>I'll carry it now, didn't have enough strength...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_3024"><text>What body? Get lost...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_lost_start_dlg_401"><text>Go away, Marked One. I don't respect you...</text></string>

<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_101"><text>Well? Shall we go further?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_1021"><text>Come on, go ahead, I'll follow you.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_1022"><text>Let me rest... I'm tired.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_103"><text>Alright, I'll slowly go south... Don't fall behind...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_104"><text>Alright, move, move...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_301"><text>Well, here we are. Marked One, where's Kostyan?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_3021"><text>Got tired of carrying, needed to rest. Left him not far. Wait, I'll go get him now.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_3022"><text>Here he is, lying nearby.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_3023"><text>Sorry, that's how it happened... didn't carry him all the way...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_3032"><text>Yeah... Here, this is a suitable place for a grave. Eh, Kostyan...\nThank you, Marked One, for the help. Honestly, I don't even know how to thank you.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_3033"><text>Damn! How could this happen?! Eh...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_3042"><text>Alright, don't worry, we're even.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_3043"><text>You... Alright. See you...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_305"><text>Wait. Here... take Kostik's rifle, some ammo and medicine.\nYou'll probably go further to the center? I heard there was a priest somewhere near Bar. If you meet him, ask him to come here. Even if I'm not here, let him pray for Kostyan.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_3061"><text>I'll ask. Farewell, Sanya.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_3062"><text>I'll ask. Listen, got a question for you. How did you get from the Agroprom base to the hamlet where I met you?</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_307"><text>Don't know about the path? If you follow the power line from the base southeast, you'll soon see iron gates in a razor wire fence. Climb over them, then go straight, don't turn anywhere. Radiation, of course, plenty there, but I threw empty cans along the safe path. They should be clearly visible even at dusk.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_308"><text>Got it. Farewell, Sanya.</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_401"><text>Huh? What? You... sorry. Don't want to talk...</text></string>
<string id="sanek_marsh_start_dlg_402"><text>Yeah, I understand...</text></string>

<string id="shersh_start_dialog_101"><text>Whatcha want, man... What you need?</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_1021"><text>Now I'll show you "what I need"! Scumbag...</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_1022"><text>You're Hornet? Got business with you.</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_103"><text>Listen, who are you? Get lost, I wanna sleep...</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_104"><text>Wake up, you'll sleep through your trial... Spill it, where'd you put the PDA that you and Kirpich snatched from the Duty guy in Dark Valley?</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_105"><text>What are you, prosecutor? Got business - then speak up... Not this "spill-confess" crap... Pour me something to cure hangover, then maybe I'll remember somethin'...</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_1061"><text>What a weirdo you are. Here, take it... Try not to choke.</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_1062"><text>I got no vodka for you!</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_1071"><text>You're the one... That starts with M. My soul hurts... I seen such things you never dreamed of... Alright, you give me - I give you. I sold this mobile to the eggheads. Not far from here, at the old Clear Sky base. What's his name... Ah! Pakhom! Yeah! In short, I don't have it...</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_1072"><text>Well, figure it out yourself. Then I don't remember where this mobile is...</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_1081"><text>Damn... Couldn't say right away...</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_1082"><text>What a backyard drunk...</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_201"><text>You again! What you want?</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_202"><text>Where's the PDA, Hornet?</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_203"><text>Where's the booze?</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_204"><text>You're getting on my nerves with your booze!</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_301"><text>What else you need from me, nutcase?</text></string>
<string id="shersh_start_dialog_401"><text>Oh! Damn! Will you leave me alone?</text></string>

<string id="shersh_pahom_dialog_0"><text>Pakhomych, I need to find one item.</text></string>
<string id="shersh_pahom_dialog_1"><text>You could at least say hello, Marked One. What item, and why to me?</text></string>
<string id="shersh_pahom_dialog_2"><text>Sorry... Hello, Pakhom... One thug, Hornet, said he gave you a PDA that I'm looking for.</text></string>
<string id="shersh_pahom_dialog_3"><text>That Mikola guy... Was here recently, yeah... Alcoholic, drags everything he finds for a bottle... Wait, where is it... Ah! Here! Take it...</text></string>
<string id="shersh_pahom_dialog_4"><text>Thanks.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="pahom_full_banka_dialog_0"><text>Hello, Pakhom! I brought "Jelly" here.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_full_banka_dialog_11"><text>Excellent! Sergeich was just asking about it.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_full_banka_dialog_12"><text>Where should I put it? No need right now, bring it later.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_full_banka_dialog_21"><text>Here they are, the jars. Take them, just be careful.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_full_banka_dialog_22"><text>I want to check something with them, I'll give them back later.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_full_banka_dialog_3"><text>Don't worry, I'm experienced. You wouldn't believe the crap people bring. How about you, should I throw in some medicine and food or will you take pills with sleeping aid? I know many in the Zone complain about bad sleep. Sergeich recently ordered a batch of pills for our people, seems to help. Told me to reward stalkers for services to science with them too, if there's a need. So what do you choose?</text></string>
<string id="pahom_full_banka_dialog_41"><text>Don't complain about sleep, but always want to eat. And dogs, the bastards, bite painfully. Radiation everywhere too...</text></string>
<string id="pahom_full_banka_dialog_42"><text>Sleeping pills would be very handy. Sometimes have to specifically look for local kitties to purr me a lullaby...</text></string>
<string id="pahom_full_banka_dialog_51"><text>You're right. Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_full_banka_dialog_52"><text>The things stalkers think up... Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_full_banka_dialog_5"><text>Can't understand you - first you need it, then later...</text></string>
<string id="pahom_full_banka_dialog_6"><text>Yeah. Thanks.</text></string>

<string id="tex_pseudo_ghost"><text>The corpse I found in laboratory X-16 - this is not Ghost! Don't know where such certainty comes from, but some sixth sense tells me I'm not wrong about this. Apparently, Guide has a photo with Strelok. Need to visit Cordon and find this stalker, about whom, as I know, strange rumors circulate.</text></string>

<string id="borov_save_prisoner_dialog_0"><text>I heard you're holding Duty guys prisoner?</text></string>
<string id="borov_save_prisoner_dialog_1"><text>Those blabbermouths! Well... there was that... What the hell were they doing poking around?! We warned them a thousand times - don't stick your nose in... But no! The law ain't written for fools!</text></string>
<string id="borov_save_prisoner_dialog_2"><text>Hm... Maybe let them go? I'll talk to who I need to, maybe they'll count it as a good deed for you...</text></string>
<string id="borov_save_prisoner_dialog_3"><text>I don't give a shit about good deeds! Want it nice? Then get those goats to release my pal...</text></string>
<string id="borov_save_prisoner_dialog_4"><text>What goats?</text></string>
<string id="borov_save_prisoner_dialog_5"><text>Don't know goats? Those horned, stupid and belligerent ones... Called Duty guys... They got a little basement in Bar, keeping one of my pals there. Thought he'd sell out the bros... They won't live to see it!</text></string>
<string id="borov_save_prisoner_dialog_6"><text>So what do you want?</text></string>
<string id="borov_save_prisoner_dialog_7"><text>Tell their... Chief... Wants to see his guys alive - let Poker go! Won't release him by day after tomorrow - we'll gut all the goat-beards!</text></string>
<string id="borov_save_prisoner_dialog_8"><text>I'll talk... We'll see...</text></string>

<string id="prut2_dialog_101"><text>Greetings, man! Come over, sit down, let's get acquainted...</text></string>
<string id="prut2_dialog_102"><text>Alright, let's get acquainted... Marked One. And you?</text></string>
<string id="prut2_dialog_103"><text>They call me Rod. I've been in the Zone for a long time, know a lot... If you're interested, ask away.</text></string>
<string id="prut2_dialog_201"><text>Marked One! Come over, have a seat...</text></string>
<string id="bar_bio_dialog_0"><text>Tell me about those you know...</text></string>
<string id="bar_bio_dialog_1"><text>Tell, you say? Alright, just pour me something, my tongue gets tied when dry...</text></string>
<string id="bar_bio_dialog_11"><text>More? Get out a bottle, maybe I'll remember someone else.</text></string>
<string id="bar_bio_dialog_21"><text>Well, let's lubricate... Cheers...</text></string>
<string id="bar_bio_dialog_22"><text>No, I won't drink now, need a clear head.</text></string>
<string id="bar_bio_dialog_3"><text>Excellent! Went down smooth!</text></string>
<string id="bar_bio_dialog_4"><text>Interesting, who else do you know about?</text></string>
<string id="bar_bio_dialog_5"><text>Alright, see you later...</text></string>

<string id="sidor_capsule_dialog_0"><text>I found some weird stuff here, take a look.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_capsule_dialog_1"><text>Let me see, let me see... You're lucky, Marked One. This "stuff" is called a capsule. Inside is a very good artifact. But the capsule shell is very durable, you can't just break it with anything. Need to use a lot of electricity to clean the artifact. I could probably help... Not for free, of course...</text></string>
<string id="barman_capsule_dialog_0"><text>I found some weird stuff here, take a look.</text></string>
<string id="barman_capsule_dialog_1"><text>Let me see, let me see... You're lucky, Marked One. This "stuff" is called a capsule. Inside is a very good artifact. But the capsule shell is very durable, you can't just break it with anything. Need to use a lot of electricity to clean the artifact. I could probably help... Not for free, of course...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_capsule_dialog_0"><text>Professor, I came across an unusual item.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_capsule_dialog_1"><text>Show me... You're a lucky man, Marked One. Stalkers call such a thing a capsule. We haven't figured out exactly why some artifacts are enclosed in super-strong shells. We have to place this capsule inside an installation that creates a polarized magnetic field with intensity over three thousand Gauss. Sometimes even the generator can't handle the load... And spare parts for it are hard to deliver here...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_capsule_have_dialog_0"><text>Let's open the artifact capsule.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_capsule_have_dialog_1"><text>Phew, alright... Gas is expensive nowadays, you understand.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_capsule_have_dialog_11"><text>What am I, a factory? The previous one isn't ready yet!</text></string>
<string id="sidor_capsule_have_dialog_21"><text>Well alright, got it. Here, take your thousands.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_capsule_have_dialog_22"><text>I got a simple little artifact, take it.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_capsule_have_dialog_23"><text>Listen, Sidorovich, you need to be kinder to people.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_capsule_have_dialog_31"><text>Yeah. Come back in an hour, should crack open by then.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_capsule_have_dialog_33"><text>I'm already kind, if you haven't noticed... So no profit - no talk...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_capsule_already_dialog_0"><text>How's my capsule doing?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_capsule_already_dialog_11"><text>You're too fast, Marked One, wait a bit more.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_capsule_already_dialog_12"><text>Your artifact is ready, here, take it, use it... Maybe you'll sell it? I give good prices... What? No? Well, suit yourself.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_capsule_already_dialog_2"><text>Alright, I'll wait...</text></string>

<string id="barman_capsule_have_dialog_0"><text>Shall we make a deal about the capsule? Will you open it?</text></string>
<string id="barman_capsule_have_dialog_1"><text>Only out of respect for your services, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="barman_capsule_have_dialog_11"><text>Boiler's busy! Come later...</text></string>
<string id="barman_capsule_have_dialog_21"><text>Money, artifacts... Here, take the rubles...</text></string>
<string id="barman_capsule_have_dialog_22"><text>I got a simple little artifact, take it.</text></string>
<string id="barman_capsule_have_dialog_23"><text>I'll better go to Sidor, he's kinder.</text></string>
<string id="barman_capsule_have_dialog_31"><text>So. Come back in an hour, should cook by then.</text></string>
<string id="barman_capsule_have_dialog_33"><text>I'm already kind, if you haven't noticed... So no profit - no talk...</text></string>

<string id="barman_capsule_already_dialog_0"><text>Well, how's my capsule?</text></string>
<string id="barman_capsule_already_dialog_11"><text>You're too fast, Marked One, good artifacts take time to cook...</text></string>
<string id="barman_capsule_already_dialog_12"><text>Your artifact is cooked, here, take it, use it... I got a client for such, maybe you'll sell?</text></string>
<string id="barman_capsule_already_dialog_2"><text>Alright, I'll wait...</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_capsule_have_dialog_0"><text>Will you help me open the capsule?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_capsule_have_dialog_1"><text>Why not help? Only you know, Marked One, certain circles that help us with funding are interested in studying Zone gifts not only in field conditions, but also within certain state... hm... and not only, laboratories. So I ask you to help us too. In the form of an artifact - first level...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_capsule_have_dialog_11"><text>You know, my dear fellow, the installation is busy now, let's try a bit later.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_capsule_have_dialog_22"><text>An artifact? Will this one do?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_capsule_have_dialog_23"><text>Well, professor, unfortunately I don't have such a thing.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_capsule_have_dialog_31"><text>Yes-yes. Of course! Please wait about fifteen minutes. I think no more will be needed...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_capsule_have_dialog_33"><text>Very unfortunate... We can't afford charity yet.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_capsule_already_dialog_0"><text>Well? What kind of artifact is in there?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_capsule_already_dialog_11"><text>Need to wait more, the coating is very resistant, needs time...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_capsule_already_dialog_12"><text>Managed to open it, here's this artifact. Not the rarest, but doesn't lie on the road either... Maybe you'll donate it to science?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_capsule_already_dialog_2"><text>Alright, I'll wait...</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_brain_off_dialog_0"><text>I've been wanting to ask about that underground place where Vasiliev disappeared.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_brain_off_dialog_11"><text>You mean object 16? The underground complex?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_brain_off_dialog_12"><text>Don't know, maybe 16. I somehow didn't immediately think about what's actually there.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_brain_off_dialog_1"><text>M-m-m... Apparently, it's a laboratory. I can't say for sure, of course, but probably some experiments were conducted there to create a device that could explain or, say, affect this phenomenon called by everyone with one word - ZONE...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_brain_off_dialog_2"><text>I don't understand this. I turned off several switches and what? What happened? Did this radiation disappear completely or what? I also saw a huge brain! Where did it come from?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_brain_off_dialog_3"><text>Marked One, unfortunately, I don't have exact answers to your questions. From the scraps of information we managed to collect, an attempt was made in this place to grow a biological computer. With the help of genetic engineering and nanotechnology, the first encouraging results were obtained. Then a "breakthrough", "emission" or whatever happened... Generally, under external stimulation, or maybe in response to it, the biological component - that very Brain you saw - began generating a new type of radiation, PSI - as we call it now... We haven't reliably established more than that yet.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_brain_off_dialog_4"><text>Was I really the only one who managed to break through?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_brain_off_dialog_5"><text>Heh-heh... You flatter yourself, Marked One. From time to time the radiation loses strength, and some stalkers manage to penetrate inside. Few return, if you can say "return". The shell returns. But the mind... The mind stays somewhere there. Besides - the time when you can get closer is very variable, and what's most unpleasant - after this lull the radiation changes form and supposedly previously effective protective devices don't ensure the safety of our gray matter.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_brain_off_dialog_6"><text>What about the switches? I turned them off!</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_brain_off_dialog_7"><text>As far as we could determine, these switches only change the radiation mode, some time will pass and the radiation will again strike the careless... M-m-yes! If only we could find where the power for this whole system comes from and turn it off. So far nobody has succeeded.</text></string>

<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_51"><text>Don't hover around here, boy, I'm busy...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_52"><text>U-uh...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_101"><text>Come in, stalker. Here on business or just to chat?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_102"><text>Greetings! I see the light's on. Thought I'd drop by. Why are you alone here, not with everyone by the fire?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_103"><text>I'm too old to sit on the ground with the boys getting hemorrhoids. I prefer to be near a warm stove. What's your name, boy?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_104"><text>Recently - Marked One. And I don't know my real name. Or rather, don't remember. Woke up recently in this camp. What's in my pockets, what's in my memory - everywhere's empty. What should I call you? And what do you do here?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_105"><text>Well, Marked One, glad to meet you. Call me Vergas. I'm, you could say, to some degree your fellow sufferer. After the first emission I woke up on a cot in the sanatorium. Was like a small child - could only moo. Thanks to the local guys - they pulled me out. And on the cot was a piece of nameplate with surname: "Vergas...". Either Vergasyuk, or Vergasilidze, maybe even Vergasyan. But judging by my Ryazan mug, most likely - Vergasov. And the local dimwits aren't rich in brain convolutions so they left it as: Vergas... They bring me their junk for repair, weapons, suits. I won't take especially beat up stuff, of course, I'm not a factory, but I can fix up a bit, clean... So if your gun starts jamming or jacket falls apart at the seams, come to me, I'll help.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_106"><text>I see. Fix, solder, repair, right? I'll drop by sometime.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_201"><text>Marked One? Come in, be my guest. Or here on business?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_202"><text>Yeah, need to repair something.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_203"><text>Come on, show me this "something" of yours.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_291"><text>Thanks. I just dropped in to warm up.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_2911"><text>Well, go ahead. Warm up... Or let's chat.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_292"><text>How's the repair going?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_start_dialog_293"><text>What? Speak louder, started hearing poorly...</text></string>

<string id="vergas_hospital_0"><text>Listen, were you also doing stalker work here before? You're rather old for these things. And you mentioned some Sanatorium, that was before the Zone formed, so it turns out?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_1"><text>Well, yes. Too late for me to learn jumping around anomalies, you're right there. But my hands grow from the right place, so I'm useful and have respect from stalkers. I've been here long, from the very beginning, almost.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_2"><text>A native, what? I mean, local?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_3"><text>I wish I knew myself... I, like you, also don't remember much about myself. My life "began" a couple years before the Zone appeared. I was lying in the local Sanatorium. Was paralyzed, memory knocked out... And when it hit, I remember, everything in our ward turned upside down. Those who could, ran for it, and some croaked right away. Some staff helped carry people out...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_4"><text>And what about you?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_5"><text>I got hit hard too. Came to - lying on the floor. Reached out my hand and got up...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_6"><text>But you said you were paralyzed!</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_7"><text>That's the thing! After the emission I started moving! Slowly, slowly, but I got up, started walking. Not like a young man, of course, but still. So the Zone raised me up, now it feeds me. Though if it wasn't for the emission, maybe the doctors would've managed to restore my memory...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_8"><text>How so?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_9"><text>Three days before it all went to hell, a group of medics from some Asian country came to us. They brought their new drugs, were looking for volunteers for trials. Well, I had nothing to lose, so I volunteered. They assured me that one of their mixtures could help restore memory. But I didn't get to try it. Maybe it's for the best...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_10"><text>What kind of drug was it?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_11"><text>How the hell should I know?! I only saw - in a small bottle, with a red label, and inscriptions in their scribbles. I wasn't interested further. I think now I wouldn't risk drinking that chemistry... But you, if you want, try looking for it yourself in the Sanatorium.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_121"><text>And how do I get there?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_122"><text>The Sanatorium... well, thanks, I'll keep it in mind.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_131"><text>Not far from here, but I won't say exactly where, I was a bit out of it when I got out. Ask around the folk, those with more experience, they surely know where and what...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_132"><text>I can make marks in your PDA, but I'm not sure they're accurate. The local young ones showed me maps, but I haven't been to those parts myself. Maybe there are other paths and routes. Ask around the folk, those with more experience, they surely know exactly where and what...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_15"><text>Wait. I have a request for you in case you do decide to visit the Sanatorium. Look around, maybe you'll come across one little thing of mine - a tea cup. Or not a cup... a mug, maybe?! Eh, I can't remember exactly anymore, but something like that for sure! For me it's the only, albeit ghostly, memory from the past. If only I could hold it in my hands again, who knows, maybe something else would surface in my memory.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_16"><text>A tea cup? Come on, old man! I can take a look when I get there, of course, but can such things really survive in today's ruins?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_hospital_17"><text>I'm not insisting, but what if. I'd throw in some useful present. Though, considering that I've already asked several stalker acquaintances about the same thing, and there's still no result, I don't think you'll have luck either. But still, I ask you to look. It's very important to me.</text></string>

<string id="dead_vergas_list_trader_repair"><text>So... This will need </text></string>
<string id="vergas_list_trader_repair_6"><text>This will cost... Probably, </text></string>
<string id="vergas_list_trader_repair_1"><text>For repairing this peashooter I'll ask </text></string>
<string id="vergas_list_trader_repair_2"><text>Repairing this piece will cost you </text></string>

<string id="list_time_repair_2"><text>will have to tinker... Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="list_trader_repair_2"><text>So, by preliminary estimate the cost of armor repair will be: </text></string>

<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_0"><text>Here, my suit got worn out. See?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_11"><text>Let me take a look. Uh... Yeah...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_12"><text>I can see it, but I'm busy right now. Come back later.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_21"><text>Well?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_22"><text>Later it is then.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_31"><text>Can make it decent, add a couple patches, change some plates...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_32"><text>Look how beat up you are... No, brother, I can't help you here. Only a specialist can fix such damage.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_33"><text>This is a cloak made of flesh hide! I'm no help in this matter. Special skill is needed here. I don't know who could make it decent.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_34"><text>Your suit is kind of strange, I don't get it... No, I won't take it on. I'm afraid I'll only make it worse. If you have a tool kit, better try it yourself.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_411"><text>Alright, agreed, here's the cash.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_412"><text>The money's not much, but I'm tight right now.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_42"><text>Pity...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_43"><text>You disappointed me...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_5"><text>Well, you go take a walk for now. I don't like it when people nudge my elbow...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_6"><text>Alright, I'll take a walk.</text></string>

<string id="esc_vergas_repair_mask_dialog_0"><text>Will you look at the mask on my suit?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_mask_dialog_11"><text>Come on, put it here... Now, what's the problem, dear fellow?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_mask_dialog_12"><text>No time right now, I'm working. Come back later.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_mask_dialog_211"><text>You're joking. Look, there are chips, but seems like it's not leaking yet, holding the seal.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_mask_dialog_212"><text>You're joking. Look for yourself, the glass is broken... In general, no point mentioning the seal.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_mask_dialog_22"><text>Later it is then.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_mask_dialog_3"><text>Yeah... You see, whether the seal is broken or not, there's no big difference. If I can patch holes and tears in the armored part, the glass can only be replaced entirely. I'll also have to keep the suit to check if it's leaking harmful atmosphere anywhere.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_mask_dialog_4"><text>And how much will this replacement cost me? And how long?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_mask_dialog_5"><text>Let me estimate... About an hour of work, I think, and money-wise - from you </text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_mask_dialog_61"><text>Agreed, take the payment.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_mask_dialog_62"><text>Seems cheap, but I don't have that much right now.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_mask_dialog_7"><text>Yeah, good. Now don't stand over my shoulder. Go take a walk for an hour.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_mask_dialog_8"><text>No problem.</text></string>

<string id="vergas_rep_item_0"><text>Can I patch up armor myself? What's needed for that?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_rep_item_1"><text>If the damage is minor, then yes. I, and other repairmen, collect repair kits for such purposes.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_rep_item_2"><text>How do you use repair kits?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_rep_item_3"><text>Need to explain everything... To use a repair kit, you need to put a special repair box on the ground, open it and take one of the kits. If armor or weapons are heavily damaged, then a repair kit won't help. If there's a vise nearby, you can fix even more serious damage. That's all...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_rep_item_4"><text>What's a repair box?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_rep_item_5"><text>A repair box is a case for repair kits. You can't use a kit without it. You can trade the box for artifacts with Sidorovich, and I can assemble armor and weapon repair kits myself. I'll sell them for local currency if needed.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_rep_item_6"><text>Yeah, got it...</text></string>

<string id="vergas_rep_item_have_0"><text>Put together several repair kits for me.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_rep_item_have_11"><text>Sorry, friend. Don't have any more ready ones. Come by tomorrow.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_rep_item_have_12"><text>Well, let me assemble some. Which ones do you need?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_rep_item_have_21"><text>Armor ones.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_rep_item_have_22"><text>I'll take the weapon one.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_rep_item_have_23"><text>Bit pricey though.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_rep_item_have_31"><text>Deal!</text></string>
<string id="vergas_rep_item_have_32"><text>Agreed!</text></string>

<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn1_dialog_0"><text>Here, my peashooter jams often, take a look.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn1_dialog_11"><text>Let me take a look. Uh... Yeah...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn1_dialog_12"><text>I'm busy right now. Come back later.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn1_dialog_21"><text>Well? What do you say?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn1_dialog_22"><text>Later it is then.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn1_dialog_31"><text>In general, nothing terrible, I'll replace a couple parts...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn1_dialog_32"><text>Who brings weapons to such condition! There's nothing to help with here! Easier to buy a new one.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn1_dialog_411"><text>Alright, deal, here's the cash.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn1_dialog_412"><text>For a couple parts? I don't have that much!</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn1_dialog_42"><text>Pity...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn1_dialog_5"><text>I'll tinker for a while, and you don't stand over my shoulder, go on...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn1_dialog_6"><text>As you say.</text></string>

<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn2_dialog_0"><text>My barrel jams, and there's big spread. Will you take a look?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn2_dialog_11"><text>Let me take a look. Uh... Yeah...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn2_dialog_12"><text>Let's do this a bit later. I'm working on another order right now.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn2_dialog_21"><text>Well? To the morgue?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn2_dialog_22"><text>Alright, I'll come back later...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn2_dialog_31"><text>You need to clean your weapon on time, Marked One. Then it won't let you down. Alright, I'll fix it up a bit.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn2_dialog_32"><text>This is scrap metal, not a weapon! Throw it away or give it to Sidorovich. Though not sure he'll want it. Even for pennies.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn2_dialog_411"><text>Alright, here's the cash.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn2_dialog_412"><text>You're something! I don't have that kind of money.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn2_dialog_42"><text>Pity...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn2_dialog_5"><text>I'm used to working without supervision! Take a walk for now, alright?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_wpn2_dialog_6"><text>As you say.</text></string>

<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_end_0"><text>Vergas, what about my repair?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_end_1"><text>Huh? Can't hear, speak louder!</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_end_21"><text>What about the repair, I'm asking? I asked you to fix the mask...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_end_22"><text>What about the repair, I'm asking? I left you my armor...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_end_23"><text>What about the repair, I'm asking? I left you my weapon...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_end_31"><text>All done already! Here, take it, not a fly sat on it.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_end_32"><text>You're too hasty. I still need time...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_end_41"><text>Well thanks, old man. I owe you!</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_end_42"><text>Well, I'll wait...</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_end_411"><text>By the way, did you see that the whole mask on this suit is broken? Need to change the glass if you don't want to breathe all kinds of crap in the next contaminated area.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_end_412"><text>By the way, are you aware that this suit is full of holes and tears, which means it'll let in poisonous atmosphere? Need to patch it up. You don't want to breathe all kinds of crap in the next contaminated area, do you?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_end_413"><text>Come on, what's the big deal... Already paid properly after all.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vergas_repair_bronik_dialog_end_5"><text>Thanks for the warning. I'll think about it.</text></string>

<string id="dolgovjazyi_dialog_start_101"><text>Hey there, friend. Name's Vitaly, and you?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_dialog_start_102"><text>I'm Marked One. Just Vitaly? Stalkers usually have nicknames, but you, it seems, just go by name...</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_dialog_start_103"><text>I'm not a stalker. But I got a nickname too - go by Lanky. Me and Docent work here quietly. He's more into electronics and such, and I fix suits.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_dialog_start_104"><text>Ah, I see. Because of the rack behind you I first thought you were trading them.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_dialog_start_105"><text>Nah, I display the repaired ones there. Waiting for their owners.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_dialog_start_106"><text>So you repair, eh? How is it, profitable business?</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_dialog_start_107"><text>Can't complain. You know what places these are, so my craft is very much in demand. Especially among our protectors from "Duty". Their command constantly sends them on raids against mutants. So the guys bring their holey suits after such trips. You bring yours too if you need it.</text></string>
<string id="dolgovjazyi_dialog_start_201"><text>Hello, Marked One. About repair or what?</text></string>

<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_0"><text>Yeah, this weapon often lets me down...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_1"><text>Well, let me take a look... Wow! Well...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_12"><text>I'm busy right now. Put your weapon away for now. Come back later...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_13"><text>Later? Well, see...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_101"><text>So what do you say?</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_1031"><text>Can fix it, I'll clean it, replace a couple parts...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_4"><text>I agree, here's the money...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_5"><text>You ask too much, I don't have that kind of money...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_7"><text>I'll work on the repair, and you can have a couple drinks at the Bar...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_9"><text>Suit yourself...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_1032"><text>Who brings weapons to such condition! There's nothing to help with here! Easier to buy a new one...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_1042"><text>Pity...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_1033"><text>Wow! Holy shit! What the hell is this? No, I can't repair such materials, you do it yourself...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn1_dialog_1043"><text>Well damn!</text></string>

<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_0"><text>Look here, it jams, and big spread too. Will you take a look?</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_1"><text>Let me take a look... Uh... Yeah...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_12"><text>Let's do this a bit later... I have another order that's not ready yet.</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_13"><text>Alright, I'll go have a couple drinks at the Bar.</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_101"><text>Well? Will it live?</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_1031"><text>Marked One, you don't take care of your weapon at all? That's why it lets you down! A weapon saves your life, and you treat it like... Not good. Alright, I'll fix it up a bit, oil it, maybe change the firing pin.</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_4"><text>Well alright, I agree, here's the money.</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_5"><text>You're something! I don't have that kind of money.</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_7"><text>Listen, take a walk around the Bar for now... Can't stand it when people hover over my shoulder...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_9"><text>Alright, I'll take a walk...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_1032"><text>Yeah... This is scrap metal, not a weapon! Throw it away! You can't bring a weapon to such condition, how you treat it, that's how it treats you...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_1042"><text>Eh, and I was hoping...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_1033"><text>No... This isn't for amateur repairs at all. Here, brother, that's it! In short - no, won't take it on. You go clean it yourself, oil it, but I don't want to mess with this...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_wpn2_dialog_1043"><text>Well damn! Hell.</text></string>

<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_bronik_dialog_end_0"><text>Yurko, what about my order?</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_bronik_dialog_end_1"><text>All done already! Here, take it, like new...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_bronik_dialog_end_2"><text>Well thanks... I owe you!</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_bronik_dialog_end_11"><text>Only cats are born fast, Marked One... I still need time...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_repair_bronik_dialog_end_12"><text>Well, I'll wait...</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_list_trader_repair_1"><text>For repairing this junk of yours I'll take </text></string>
<string id="lisaped_list_trader_repair_2"><text>Repairing this weapon will cost you </text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_start_dialog_101"><text>So, another one... Well? Broke your own weapon?</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_start_dialog_102"><text>Broke it? No, I take care of my weapon! Why do you think that?</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_start_dialog_103"><text>Well of course! I repair all kinds of weapon junk, you came here, that is, to me. Conclusion: you need to repair a weapon... All logical, isn't it?</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_start_dialog_104"><text>Well yes, logical... I'm Marked One, and you?</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_start_dialog_105"><text>Huh? Well yes, you don't know me yet... Name's Yurko. The local dimwits nicknamed me Lisaped... Can't even say the word bicycle right, and yet... I used to be into bicycle tourism before the Zone, and under "this business" I happened to mention it. Well, that's it, done! The nickname stuck - can't tear it off!\nWell anyway, in general, if you need a weapon repaired, you're welcome.</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_start_dialog_106"><text>Thanks, really useful business...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_start_dialog_201"><text>Come in, Marked One, on business or what?</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_start_dialog_202"><text>Listen, look at my weapon...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_start_dialog_203"><text>Let me take a look, pistol or what?</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_start_dialog_291"><text>Just like that, my weapon seems to be fine...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_start_dialog_294"><text>Suit yourself, maybe you need something else...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_start_dialog_292"><text>Hey! I'm about the order...</text></string>
<string id="bar_lisaped_start_dialog_293"><text>What? Can't hear...</text></string>

<string id="sidor_black_tip_0"><text>Help me out, Sidorovich, trouble happened! I got a strange artifact lying in my backpack, but I clearly remember I didn't pick it up. Can't throw it away - after some time it somehow ends up there again. Ever since this artifact appeared, I've been having health problems and constantly getting hungry...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_black_tip_1"><text>Yeah, Marked One, it's always either diarrhea or scrofula with you. This is bad business, I'll say right away. By all signs, you caught the "Black Mark" - the nastiest artifact in the Zone. And is it even an artifact? One word - parasite. Pretends to be any harmless thing, just so someone picks it up, and then, having latched onto its victim, never lets go until it drains all life force drop by drop. Horror!</text></string>
<string id="sidor_black_tip_2"><text>But how... You mean to say I'm doomed and there's no chance of salvation, right? That's what you want to say? Really no way at all to get rid of this crap?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_black_tip_3"><text>Don't yell like that... If I'm honest, God knows. I know little about this, just rumors. And you can't tell where's truth and where's empty chatter. In your place I'd ask old experienced stalkers. Wolf, for example, or your savior - Redhead.\nAh! Here's another, I remember, one of the young ones, returning after his first trip to the Bar about two weeks ago, told me that there's one "Duty guy" there, called Brome. So this Brome was chatting over a bottle by the fire that some buddy of his managed to survive the "Black Mark". Who knows, maybe he wasn't lying.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_black_tip_4"><text>Brome... Thanks, I'll try to find him and have a chat. And I'll definitely ask the experienced ones for advice. Anything else?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_black_tip_5"><text>Take more food supplies for the road and don't forget medicine - you complained about health and being ravenous yourself. Good luck!</text></string>

<string id="voron_black_tip1_dlg_0"><text>Help me out, Raven! I'm in trouble with the "Black Mark". I was told you know a way to get rid of it.</text></string>
<string id="voron_black_tip1_dlg_11"><text>You understand that such secrets aren't laid out for the first person you meet? Sorry, buddy, we barely know each other. Who knows, maybe you're planning some scam with this knowledge, leading honest stalkers astray. No offense.</text></string>
<string id="voron_black_tip1_dlg_12"><text>Yes, you're in deep trouble, guy. But you understand that such secrets aren't laid out for just anyone?</text></string>
<string id="voron_black_tip1_dlg_2"><text>I'm "just anyone"? And who got you the Artist's album? And who searched for various unusual things for your collectors?</text></string>
<string id="voron_black_tip1_dlg_31"><text>Alright, alright. You shamed me. Losing a good business partner due to excessive caution would be short-sighted on my part.\nI warn you in advance: I can't give any guarantees that the method will actually work. Haven't personally tested it, as you understand. Source of information - one of my trusted assistants who had contacts with a representative of the "Monolith" group. From his words. There's a special place in the west of Foggy Thicket. There in a hollow between hills stands a huge crystal, which is either a broken-off part or a projection of that very "Monolith" that these fanatics worship. The "Black Mark" is also somehow connected to it and serves as something like an identification sign. Sometimes by mistake the mark gets to someone completely different from who it should have, and then there's a possibility to "return" it to the real owner. I don't get how it works myself, but the practical side looks like this: at the foot of the crystal you need to lay out one brand new artifact each of first, second and third category. This will be a sacrifice or payment for the "Monolith" to turn its gaze upon you. Then you throw out the mark. If the trick worked, it should disappear completely and never return. Sounds like nonsense, but I bought it for what I'm selling it for. That's all, good luck!</text></string>
<string id="voron_black_tip1_dlg_32"><text>Well, yes, you brought some things from the list, but I settled with you fairly as agreed. No, Marked One, while we have business relations, not friendly ones, let's continue following established rules of commerce. A thousand bucks from you for information.</text></string>
<string id="voron_black_tip1_dlg_33"><text>Searched and found - not the same thing, isn't it? No, Marked One, while we have business relations, not friendly ones, let's continue following established rules of commerce. Two thousand bucks from you for information.</text></string>
<string id="voron_black_tip1_dlg_421"><text>Here's the money. Don't keep me waiting...</text></string>
<string id="voron_black_tip1_dlg_431"><text>That's not commerce anymore, that's robbery! However, the dead have no use for money. Start talking.</text></string>
<string id="voron_black_tip1_dlg_4"><text>And good people warned that I'd have to overcome my own toad first, and only then turn to you...</text></string>

<string id="voron_black_tip2_dlg_0"><text>I'm here again about the "Black Mark"...</text></string>
<string id="voron_black_tip2_dlg_1"><text>We already discussed everything. What else?</text></string>
<string id="voron_black_tip2_dlg_2"><text>Maybe you'll still give a discount for old times' sake? I did help you with some things too...</text></string>
<string id="voron_black_tip2_dlg_32"><text>No, Marked One, while we have business relations, not friendly ones, let's continue following established rules of commerce. A thousand bucks for the information you're interested in.</text></string>

<string id="black_tip_general_dlg_0"><text>I want to ask a question. "Black Mark" - doesn't that tell you anything?</text></string>
<string id="black_tip_general_dlg_1"><text>Holy, holy... Cross yourself! I've heard of such misfortune, and who hasn't... God forbid it happens!</text></string>
<string id="black_tip_general_dlg_2"><text>They say there's a way to survive this trouble. Maybe you'll advise something? Don't think wrong, this is me... asking for a friend.</text></string>
<string id="black_tip_general_dlg_3"><text>Sorry for your friend, of course, but... Wait, let me remember what the guys said about it. Well, first, you need to stock up on lots of food - victims of the "Black Mark" often die from banal hunger. Though, probably, you could try to get by with a "Pizza" artifact. Second, I remember, they said that drinking an energy drink helps against catching episodes with the mark, and artifacts that increase resistance to psi-seizures save from its paralyzing strikes. And so your breathing doesn't get knocked out often, you need to carry something on your belt that adds more endurance to the body.\nBut it's all empty talk... A person can't survive the "Black Mark". It'll take all his luck drop by drop, so there's only one end: if he doesn't die from hunger or pain shock, he'll end up in an "Electra", or meet a bloodsucker on a dark night, stepping away from camp to relieve himself.</text></string>
<string id="black_tip_general_dlg_4"><text>I understand you. Thanks for sharing. Hope it helps... the friend.</text></string>

<string id="tex_amk_af_night_star"><text>According to Sidorovich, somewhere south of Cordon, before the embankment, a stalker nicknamed Butterfingers lost a container with an artifact. Need to find it and deliver it to the trader. First should have a chat with the unlucky courier.</text></string>
<string id="tex_vergas_krujka_article"><text>Vergas, the repairman from Cordon, asked to look for a forgotten mug, cup, or some other dish he left in the Sanatorium once. I won't dig the ground with my nose, of course, but why not really take a look, since this thing is dear to him.</text></string>

<string id="im_chain_docent_0"><text>Listen, do you speak Chinese?</text></string>
<string id="im_chain_docent_1"><text>Well, what a question! And why do you need it?</text></string>
<string id="im_chain_docent_2"><text>You see. I found this medicine, supposedly should restore memory. But the instructions are in some hieroglyphs...</text></string>
<string id="im_chain_docent_3"><text>No way. I don't understand Chinese. Especially since everything here is handwritten, even a scanner won't take such thing. You need a translator here, some Chinese guy. Or Japanese.</text></string>
<string id="im_chain_docent_4"><text>But where to find such people...</text></string>

<string id="im_chain_sakharov_0"><text>Excuse me, could you help with translating hieroglyphs?</text></string>
<string id="im_chain_sakharov_1"><text>Hieroglyphs? Strange request. What hieroglyphs?</text></string>
<string id="im_chain_sakharov_2"><text>I was told that there's experimental medicine in the sanatorium that helps restore memory. I found it, but I'm afraid to take it without knowing what and how. And the instructions are either in Chinese or Japanese, and handwritten at that.</text></string>
<string id="im_chain_sakharov_3"><text>I see, I see. Unfortunately, we can't help with this. This requires special translator programs and a certain amount of machine time. We definitely don't have the first, and the second isn't great either, computers are almost always busy with important calculations. Unless we send your "manuscript" to the mainland, but that would take a lot of time and money... So, sorry.</text></string>
<string id="im_chain_sakharov_4"><text>Pity. What to do then...</text></string>

<string id="bar_arena_man_start_101"><text>Hey, Stalker! You look pretty lost. You here for me or looking for the repairman?</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_start_102"><text>Just looking around. What do you have here? By the way, name's Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_start_103"><text>And I'm Arnie. I run something like an exchange here. Got a small stock of ammo, can swap some for others. Mutual benefit, so to speak.</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_start_104"><text>I see. I don't need it right now, but I'll keep it in mind. You mentioned a repairman...</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_start_105"><text>That's further ahead, walk through the hangar, you won't miss it. They call him Lisaped, handy guy. Or maybe you'll still take a look at what I have for exchange?</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_start_1061"><text>Alright, show me what you have.</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_start_1062"><text>Nah, I don't have spare ammo right now anyway. See ya!</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_start_201"><text>Marked One, right? On exchange business?</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_start_2021"><text>Yeah, I need certain ammo...</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_start_2022"><text>No, just dropped by to say hello.</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_start_2031"><text>Look around, check the prices...</text></string>

<string id="bar_arena_man_no_job_start_101"><text>Well, what do you want? Don't you see I'm resting? No exchanges...</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_no_job_start_102"><text>Uh... What exchange?</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_no_job_start_103"><text>What, you new here? I'm Arnie. I exchange some ammo for others, with a small commission. Come by later, during the day, to the hangar, if you want to see the assortment.</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_no_job_start_104"><text>Got it. By the way, I'm Marked One. Nice to meet you.</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_no_job_start_105"><text>Marked One, so Marked One... Now let me relax quietly with a bottle... No offense.</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_no_job_start_201"><text>Still alive? Marked One... Seems like I wanted something from you... Slipped my mind.</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_no_job_start_202"><text>Look, I'm here often, when you remember - tell me...</text></string>
<string id="bar_arena_man_no_job_start_203"><text>Uh-huh... You better eat something...</text></string>

<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_101"><text>Hold up, stalker, don't twitch. Got business to discuss.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_102"><text>What business here? I already settled everything with Borov.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_103"><text>Borov's got authority, sure, but he's far away, and we're close. So don't get uppity. Let's see what you got. Then you can see what's here.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1041"><text>Screw off, scum! I'll smash your heads!</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1042"><text>Yeah right... Take a look.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1051"><text>Yo! Bro, come on, share the artifacts. Keep the junk to yourself, we don't give a shit about those "Jellyfish"... But the good stuff, I'll take. Don't worry, not everything. We're reasonable people. You don't mind, I hope? 'Cause you know, stiffs don't object...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1052"><text>Guys, this place is cleaned out! Shit... Give us the dough then! Ten grand each. Forty total from you, in short.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1061"><text>Look, you'll regret this... Take it!</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1062"><text>Choke on it...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1063"><text>I don't have that much.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1064"><text>Your faces will crack from my goodies!</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_107"><text>That's what I'm talkin' about! Walk on, for now.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1073"><text>Gimme your mobile, I'll check it.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_108"><text>I'll take a walk... For now...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1083"><text>Here, check all you want.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1093"><text>Fo' real, ain't got that much. Well, looks like you landed on the meter, so to speak. Now you owe us two decent artifacts, like "Gravi" or "Flash". If you find sumthin' cooler, fine, you can get away with one. And your mobile will stay with me for now. Get it? And make it quick, three days you got.\nAnd this... We don't need to show ourselves here too much, so we'll be waitin' for you in the backyard. Try to sneak in quietly - we'll waste you, just so you know.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1101"><text>Alright, alright. I got it all.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_151"><text>So how's it goin'? Brought the artifacts? Look, the clock's tickin'.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1521"><text>Choke on it... Give back the PDA.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1522"><text>Not yet. Wait... and you'll definitely get it.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1531"><text>Now you're talkin'! Here's your device. And stop starin' at me like a wolf. Everyone hustles as best they can. Here's a small compensation for you.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_1532"><text>Now you're talkin'! I see you already got yourself a new mobile? That's good, 'cause I accidentally dropped your old one, bye-bye to it, see what crap... I even thought of compensatin' at first, wouldn't be right otherwise, but since you're such a rich guy that you're already showin' off with a new one, then you'll manage, I guess. Maybe I can give you such a hookup.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_154"><text>What? Where'd you get this?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_155"><text>The guys spotted how an electric chimera flew into a "Burner" on the hill earlier. Got fried instantly, but we managed to cut a trophy off it. I know stalkers use this crap somehow, so I decided to unload it on you. If you're up for it, drop by later sometime, we'll have a chat. Maybe some opportunity will show up.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_156"><text>We'll see.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_201"><text>Benefactor! Wanna share more?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_202"><text>Yeah, I wanna! Give each one the maximum...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_203"><text>Don't make noise, cripple. You can see yourself, we're sittin' here without opportunities. Borov, the bastard, won't let us make much dough... Don't smirk. You're alive, and didn't lose that much loot. Rasp has a conscience too. And fo' real, maybe you'll still get a pile of loot. You'll have dough, booze and everything else plenty!</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_2041"><text>First you robbed me, now you're offerin' your "deals"? No thanks, I think I'll pass.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_2042"><text>You lay it out first, then we'll see.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_205"><text>Business talk. In short, here's the deal: got a tip on a stash with fat loot, on the Garbage. If we make a deal - everything goes to you.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_206"><text>And in return from me you want...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_207"><text>I want you to get me a piece. No bullshit, so I don't become a punk!</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_208"><text>What kind of gun?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_209"><text>Ever heard of the "MP-153"? Real cool peashooter, can't just find it in the Zone. They say the barkeep at the Bar deals those. I had one, but drunkenly dropped it in an anomaly - and bye-bye... So, can you dig up one like that? Just make sure it ain't some busted junk, but new stuff. So, we gonna shake on it?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_2101"><text>Nah, I didn't sign up to be your errand boy here.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_2102"><text>I'll think about it, maybe I'll get you that gun.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_2111"><text>Then get the hell outta here, punk. Eh, should give you a good pluckin' "for the road", but the guys already poured the vodka, they're callin'.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_2121"><text>Take it easy, I'm already leavin'.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_301"><text>Maybe we should have a few drops?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_351"><text>Ah, you again. Get lost... Goody-two-shoes.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_352"><text>Yeah, I'm goin', I'm goin'.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_401"><text>Well, hello again. So how about the deal, made up your mind?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_bandit_glavn_start_501"><text>So? Everything good?</text></string>
<string id="tex_val_dram_bandit_glavn"><text>Rasp asked to get him a cool peashooter - "MP-153", definitely in excellent condition. For this he promised to tell about a stash with "fat loot".</text></string>

<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_0"><text>Rasp, you know Rodent?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_1"><text>The rat? Of course! That bastard owes me two bottles! Lost a bet.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_2"><text>He hinted that you know a lot and can help me with something.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_3"><text>No doubt, I know a lot. About what?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_4"><text>I'm looking for Strelok. Heard of such a stalker?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_5"><text>Strelok? Yeah, familiar handle. Seems like one buddy clashed with him about half a year ago. Like that one wanted to take some crap from a nerd, but the nerd refused. So this Strelok decided to discuss with his bros about robbin' the nerd... What came of it, I ain't in the know.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_6"><text>What about the buddy? Where is he now?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_71"><text>And where's my gun? You're too crafty, as I see it. Even a cat won't meow for free...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_72"><text>You ask too many questions. Even a cat won't meow for free... Ah, whatever! You hooked me up with a piece, I'll answer for old friendship. Crowbar - that's his handle, heard of such? Duty guys took him in, he's chillin' on their turf now.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_81"><text>Damn you all! Everyone wants me to drag some crap! Maybe I'll just give you some dough instead?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_82"><text>Some buddies you got... Should've guessed right away.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_91"><text>What, you shell-shocked? I already told ya - need the "MP-153", same as I had. And money... money won't cover your ass from a pack of pseudodogs. There'll be a gun - there'll be talk about the buddy, and if not... I'll get one myself somehow if I need to, but you'll be left out in the cold, get it?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_92"><text>Hey, don't rush it! You should know, Crowbar before he started lootin' with the bros, was a known stalker. There was even talk among ours that he nailed the main Duty boss. That's why that one's messin' with him now. Bastard!\nAnyway, Crowbar should know about your Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_krysyk_dialog_10"><text>Yeah, I get it, I get it. I'll think about your peashooter.</text></string>

<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_0"><text>Still actin' tough? Gangsters...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_1"><text>So what's up, brought the piece? Where's the "MP-153"?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_2"><text>You talking about this one?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_3"><text>Yeah, that one. Give it here...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_41"><text>Don't drag your feet... What about your buddy who knew Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_42"><text>Here! Now tell about the stash.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_43"><text>I'll think more about whether to give it up.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_51"><text>Ah... so that's it, Duty guys nabbed him. Crowbar, heard of him probably.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_521"><text>In short, on Garbage some dude stashed a backpack with decent loot. Swore by Christ. But didn't say the exact spot, wanted to lead and show himself. Hoarse tapped him lightly on the noggin, just for sense, so he wouldn't be stubborn, and he kicked the bucket. Was sick with sumthin', seems. But me and the guys roughly figured out where to look.\nThe backpack's lying in the crane cabin, on the radioactive pile, near the hangar.\nListen, I see you're a business guy. Got another deal for me, need to discuss... Just between us though.</text></string>

Got another deal for me, need to discuss... Just between us though.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_511"><text>Some buddies you got... Should've guessed right away. Nice little gun though. Think I'll keep it for myself.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_62"><text>Hold up with your deal. Let me check out that stash first, then decide if it's worth dealin' with you at all.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_512"><text>Well what can I do? You shoulda asked earlier... But he definitely had dealings with Strelok, no doubt... So where's my gun? Don't worry, I'll tell you about the stash, it's legit, you won't be at a loss.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_513"><text>After our first "meeting" I don't really believe I'll find your stash, and if I do, it won't turn out empty. And the road to Garbage, though close, has plenty monsters along the way...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_514"><text>Why bring up old stuff. Gotta live somehow. Who were you then? Just a pimple outta nowhere. Unclear who and from where. But now I see you're a right guy. So everything's honest. Want me to give you an artifact for the "MP-153"? My guys took it off some sucker earlier. Good artifact, used a bit though.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_515"><text>A worn artifact? I dunno, I dunno...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_516"><text>Well... Then I can tell about another stash, it's in the Gut. And here the tip's solid, may I drop dead. In short, like my buddy stashed some valuable thing there, long time ago. And a month ago he lost this stash of his to me in dice. In the Gut there's plenty critters too, of course, but you're a seasoned guy, probably, won't get scared. So? What you thinkin'?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_6"><text>Alright, mark your buddy's stash in my PDA.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_7"><text>Hell with you, I'll take your word... Tell me where the stash on Garbage is. It's closer to go.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_8"><text>I'd rather get mine here and now, 'cause lookin' for these stashes - hell if you'll find 'em. Give me the artifact and let's split.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_9"><text>No good, staying with our own then.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_61"><text>A-alright, now. Hold your mobile steady. Well, like here...\nListen, I see you're a business guy. Got another deal for me, need to discuss... Just between us though.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_81"><text>Here, take it. Good artifact, though slightly... worn. Anyway, it'll be useful to ya.\nListen, I see you're a business guy. Got another deal for me, need to discuss... Just between us though.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_spas_dialog_10"><text>Hold up with your deals. I need to dash somewhere on business.</text></string>

<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_0"><text>What did you want? Just keep in mind, I ain't lookin' for your junk. Make your slackers work, I ain't a bloodhound.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_11"><text>Nah... Different deal here. We should get movin' from here already, past the Bar, closer to Limansk. 'Cause here Borov's grabbin' everything for himself and the soldiers got all stirred up... No opportunities at all.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_12"><text>So, made up your mind?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_123"><text>Wait a bit. I'm waitin' for word from one bro. When it works out, then we'll decide.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_124"><text>A bit? Uh-huh...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_125"><text>I'm here with greetings from one of yours.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_126"><text>Ours? From who?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_2"><text>So get movin'. Or you need me to hold your hand?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_3"><text>Wait... Why you so jumpy? Need someone in the Bar to put in a good word for me and the guys, so they let us through, don't mess with us. We'd like to pass, just quietly, no fuss, and that's all...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_4"><text>Me?! Put in a word for you? Who's gonna listen to me? You're all the same... face to Duty guys. They won't even bother with ceremonies with you.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_5"><text>Don't say that. Someone vouched for Rat, now they say he sits in the Bar like one of their own, and he had dealings with Borov too. Must've paid someone well for protection. That's what I'm talkin' about: you go to the Bar and ain't at odds with Borov either. You walk both there and here. I suggest you pass something to the deputy of the Duty boss.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_6"><text>Who's that?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_7"><text>Yeah there's one... Ivantsov - bastard if there ever was one, would strangle him given the chance. But we got no choice... Need to discuss with him and so their boss don't find out.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_8"><text>Some secrets. What's all this to me?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_9"><text>I told you about Crowbar, that he was in business with Strelok. Got an idea how to pull him from Duty turf. He won't bother us there past the Bar, and we'll screw Borov at the same time. So you'll discuss everything about Strelok after, and maybe he'll even hook you up with him if things go well... Well, ain't that enough for ya? I'll give you sumthin' else after, when the deal works out... All you gotta do is make an agreement.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_101"><text>Yeah... "all you gotta do". They'll nab me along with you guys. No way.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_111"><text>Too bad. Think about it, I won't hurt ya.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_121"><text>I'll think about it.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_102"><text>So what exactly do you need?</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_112"><text>In short, I got somethin' on Borov... Duty guys are real mad at him, got their teeth in him.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_122"><text>And what's Ivantsov got to do with it and how's Crowbar involved? Well they're mad at Borov, but why should they let you through? I don't get somethin'...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_13"><text>What's there for you to get? They already figured it all out for ya... You just gotta pass it on, make a deal. Here's how it is: I can give up Borov's connections with the Duty leader. One of the Duty guys is Borov's man, a contact, get it? That's why we gotta discuss only with his deputy, understand? And also Borov keeps some Duty dude at his place, for some reason he needs him. Through my guys I can pull him out and hand him over to Duty in exchange for Crowbar. But only after we pass through, then we'll let him go.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_14"><text>So I'll be a hostage at Ivantsov's until you deign to let him go? I don't like somethin'.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_15"><text>You talk to him first, then we'll decide how to do it right so it's good for ours, yours, and you. I need guarantees too that they'll let us through.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_16"><text>What are my words to him? Someone, somewhere, about someone to someone said somethin'... You write on paper what you want from him, what you're offerin'. I'll pass it along when I get the chance. That'll be more reliable. And even better seal it, so he understands I'm not in the know, just a simple messenger...</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_17"><text>What you pissin' yourself for? Alright. Here... pass him my note. You'll tell me later what and how.</text></string>
<string id="val_dram_glavn_business_dialog_18"><text>That's different. But I'm not promisin' anything. Still unclear how he'll react.</text></string>

<string id="ivancov_val_business_dialog_0"><text>Here's the deal... One guy from Dark Valley asked me to pass a note.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_val_business_dialog_1"><text>"One guy"? You're being shady, Marked One. Well, what's in there?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_val_business_dialog_2"><text>I'm not being shady. Everything's as it is, that's what I'm saying. Read this.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_val_business_dialog_3"><text>I-i-i see...\nBlah-blah-blah and all that... The gist: Someone from Borov's crew wants to split off. Writes that our man is held captive by Borov. You know about this?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_val_business_dialog_41"><text>No. I'm just a messenger, your conflicts don't concern me.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_val_business_dialog_42"><text>I only know from Liuber's words: someone from his group really got captured. That's all.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_val_business_dialog_43"><text>I thought you were already aware. Saw one there. Hairy, I think, is his nickname.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_val_business_dialog_44"><text>I knew about one, Hairy. But they killed him, I think.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_val_business_dialog_51"><text>Alright, we'll find out. Don't talk much about this. Or you know yourself, who knows what people might think... Take this small present from me and forget about this business. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_val_business_dialog_52"><text>So someone from Liuber's group, right? That's good... I mean - good that there's a chance to get our comrade out. Good news.\nDon't talk much about this. Or you know yourself, who knows what people might think about you, having dealings with scumbags and all that... Take this small present from me and forget about this business. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_val_business_dialog_53"><text>So Seryoga Hairy is alive? We'll definitely pull him out...\nDon't talk much about this. Or you know yourself, who knows what people might think about you, having dealings with scumbags and all that... Take this small present from me and forget about this business. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_val_business_dialog_54"><text>They killed Seryoga? Bastards! I'll make inquiries through my channels. Maybe there's someone else there.\nDon't talk much about this. Or you know yourself, who knows what people might think about you, having dealings with scumbags and all that... Take this small present from me and forget about this business. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_val_business_dialog_6"><text>Sort it out yourselves. My hut's on the edge.</text></string>

<string id="sultan_start_dialog_101"><text>You coming to me, dove?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_102"><text>Mmm... Yeah, just looking around.</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_103"><text>Looking around? Well-well... I'm Sultan, I can hook you up with very, very rare guns. If you're interested, of course. Who are you?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_104"><text>Marked One. In principle, wouldn't hurt to have something unique for these parts. Got such a thing?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_105"><text>Know the saying about Greece? Well, almost about me. Got some models that not only don't lie around on the road, but you'll only find at my place in the whole Zone. Both Russian and Western. Everything comes down to your desire... and your capabilities. Keep in mind, blue-wing, payment is strictly in fresh artifacts. Which ones exactly - depends on the chosen goods. Get it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_106"><text>Alright, I'll think about it... See ya for now.</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_201"><text>Marked One! Still interested in guns?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_202"><text>Sultan, let's be specific, what can you offer?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2022"><text>No, just dropped by...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2032"><text>You're something! We already agreed! Don't wiggle your ass like a waitress... Be a man! Said it - do it.</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2042"><text>Alright, don't grumble... Said it, so it'll be that way.</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2031"><text>What exactly do you want to get?\nSubmachine gun?\nShotgun or carbine?\nAssault rifle or machine gun?\nLarge-caliber sniper and automatic weapons?\nOptics?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2051"><text>Submachine gun? Those small automatics? For pistol ammo?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2052"><text>Well show me, what shotguns and carbines you're offering.</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2053"><text>I want to look at assault rifles and machine guns.</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2054"><text>Large-caliber? Wow! Well, let's see...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2055"><text>Let's look at the optics...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2061"><text>Exactly! Small automatics... Here, look:\nHK UMP45\nTDI KRISS Vector</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2062"><text>Currently in stock:\nSaiga-12M Carbine\nRemington 870 (FD) Shotgun</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2063"><text>So, here's the list, choose:\nAK-103\nFN F2000 Tactical (FDE) Assault Rifle\nRPK-74(P) Machine Gun\nPKM Tactical Machine Gun\nMG36 Machine Gun</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2064"><text>Got NATO and ours, see for yourself:\nSV-98 Rifle\nAWM-F Rifle\nSVD Rifle\nFN SCAR-H Rifle\nSVU-A Rifle\nSR-3M "Vykhr" Assault Rifle</text></string>

<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20711"><text>What's the Vykhr like?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20712"><text>UMP? How's it performed in the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20712_2"><text>TDI KRISS Vector? Something new...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20713"><text>Maybe take the "Bizon"? What do you advise?</text></string>

<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20721"><text>Saiga-12M Carbine? How are the reviews?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20722"><text>Saiga? How are the reviews?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20731"><text>What's this Remington 870 (FD)?</text></string>

<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20732"><text>SVU-A? How's it performed?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20733"><text>Maybe take the AK-103? What do you advise?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20734"><text>FN F2000 Tactical (FDE) Assault Rifle? Interesting for stalkers?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20735"><text>What's this RPK-74(P)? Interesting for stalkers?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20736"><text>Let me look at the PKM Tactical, maybe I'll take it.</text></string>

<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20741"><text>SV-98M? What kind of beast is that?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20742"><text>AWM-F? How's it performed in the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20743"><text>Our weapons seem the most reliable. SVD is a famous gun...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20744"><text>MG36 Machine Gun? What do they say about it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20745"><text>SCAR-H? Probably finds the target itself?</text></string>

<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20811"><text>Good gun! Look what the specialists write about it:</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20812"><text>None of those I got it for complained. Look for yourself:</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20812_2"><text>Excellent gun! You definitely won't regret it.</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20813"><text>Advising ain't my business... You look at the characteristics:</text></string>

<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20821"><text>Of course you've heard! Such a carbine protects its owner itself, but the price for it...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20822"><text>Saiga - it's Saiga even in Africa!</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20831"><text>Kidding? Excellent peashooter! I got a description here too:</text></string>

<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20832"><text>Good gun! Reliable, but see for yourself:</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20833"><text>I'd advise taking it, nobody's complained yet...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20834"><text>Take it, take it... New development! A miracle, not a weapon:</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20835"><text>If you've piled up a bunch of ammo, then it's perfect!</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20836"><text>Take it, you won't regret it. Good gun:</text></string>

<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20841"><text>Latest development. I got a description here too:</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20842"><text>For special tasks it's indispensable! Our specialists always take it:</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20843"><text>SVD - it's SVD even in Africa. New model! Read what's written:</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20844"><text>Everyone would want one, but not everyone can get it... Look at the parameters:</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20845"><text>Take it, newest development! A miracle, not a weapon:</text></string>

<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20911"><text>Alright, agreed! I'll take it, what do you want for it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20912"><text>Good, deal! What do you want for it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20912_2"><text>Eh, agreed. What you asking for it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20913"><text>I agree. How much will it cost me?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20914"><text>Nice parameters, you convinced me... How to get it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20915"><text>Yeah, won't regret it... And what exactly won't I regret?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20921"><text>Apparently really good! How to get it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20922"><text>Would be useful to me too, how much does it cost?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20923"><text>I'll take it! When and with what should I come?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20924"><text>I want one! What are you taking for it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20925"><text>Nobody died? What will it cost me?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20931"><text>Alright, agreed! I'll take it, what do you want for it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20932"><text>Good, deal! What do you want for it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20933"><text>I agree. How much will it cost me?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20934"><text>Nice parameters, you convinced me... How to get it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20935"><text>Yeah, won't regret it... And what exactly won't I regret?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20936"><text>You convinced me! Wrap it up.</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20941"><text>Alright, agreed! I'll take it, what do you want for it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20942"><text>Good, deal! What do you want for it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20943"><text>I agree. How much will it cost me?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20944"><text>Nice parameters, you convinced me... How to get it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_20945"><text>Yeah, won't regret it... And what exactly won't I regret?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_220"><text>So, let me look some more...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_221"><text>Not bad, but I'll go for now...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_210"><text>Business talk! In general, you should understand yourself: no point dragging such guns to the Zone for ordinary artifacts. So special ones are needed, from modificates. For this specific gun any from the series:</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2111"><text>Got it, I'll find an artifact - I'll bring it. Get the gun ready.</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2112"><text>Uh, where to get such a thing... I'll think about it more.</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_212"><text>Don't rush, you're too hasty. You think I like dragging rare artifacts through half-zones? I'll inform who needs to know about your agreement. Take the artifact to my people - they've stopped at Forgotten Village for now, I think you'll find the way. Make arrangements with them about the process of getting it... Yes, and keep in mind: the artifact must be in excellent condition, so that a fly, as they say... does nothing. Got it? And let's also make sure there's no confusion like: "I want, I don't want, I changed my mind..." You agreed - I ordered! Period.</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2121"><text>And where will I look for the path to this Village?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_2122"><text>Why look for it. On Garbage, beyond the vehicle graveyard there's a gully, that's where the path to the Village starts in the woods. Don't forget about the deal.</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_213"><text>Everything will be fine...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_40"><text>I'll come another time, tight on artifacts...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_41"><text>No, I'll manage for now...</text></string>

<string id="sultan_start_dialog_31"><text>"Kashtan"? I'll take it......</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_32"><text>ELCAN? I'll take it of course...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_33"><text>PSO-1? I'll take it I suppose...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_34"><text>March Tactical? I'll take it...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_31_2"><text>Oh, Aimpoint Micro T-1, come on...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_31_3"><text>Barska ELECTRO SIGHT AC10632? What a name... Come on!</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_31_4"><text>HK Schmidt Bender - this, judging by the name, is for a Heckler rifle? Just what I need.</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_312"><text>1P78 shooting scope, for any modificate... Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_312_2"><text>This scope for any mezomodificate... Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_312_3"><text>This scope for any two 2nd level artifacts... Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_311"><text>Come on, what can you do...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_322"><text>ELCAN DR optical scope, I'll give for any mezomodificate... Will you take it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_321"><text>Come on, why not...</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_332"><text>PSO-1 optical scope, only for any of the mezomodificates... Well, taking it?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_331"><text>Hand it over of course.....</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_342"><text>March Tactical optical scope, if you have a hypermodificate in stock... Deal?</text></string>
<string id="sultan_start_dialog_341"><text>And my heart stopped beating, you convinced me....</text></string>

<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_101"><text>Hi! Bro... Haven't seen you before. What's your name?</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_1021"><text>What's with this "hi-ing"... Can't you talk normally?</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_1022"><text>Listen, do you need this? I came and I'm leaving...</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_1031"><text>Come on, why so angry? You'd have a drink, relax... We're being friendly to you, and you...</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_1032"><text>Well-well... The Zone's small... Today you turn your back on me, tomorrow I won't help.</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_1041"><text>Not in the mood... Death all around, and you're "hi-ing" here. I'm Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_1042"><text>Alright, I'm Marked One. I'll manage somehow on my own.</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_105"><text>Well there, now I know...</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_106"><text>Instead of all this "Hi-no-hi".</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_201"><text>Marked One, what brings you to us? Notice! Not "hi-ing"...</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_202"><text>That's right! Just dropped in to look around.</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_2021"><text>You better tell me this - haven't you met any soldiers here... deserters?</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_2022"><text>No, haven't seen any... The Village is generally small, maybe they're sitting in some basement or attic, not showing their noses. But without water and food they wouldn't last long. They'd have shown up already, if monsters didn't eat them first.</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_2023"><text>That's true... There's plenty small critters here.</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_301"><text>Ah! It's you, Marked One! Sultan contacted us, said you need a decent gun...</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_302"><text>Yeah, that's why I dragged myself here to you guys. So what? How do I get the order?</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_303"><text>So, Sultan informed about what you ordered. Did you bring the needed artifact? You were warned that we're only interested in fresh artifacts, right? Keep the worn ones for yourself.</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_304"><text>Haven't gotten it yet...</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_3041"><text>I have a modificate. Here, take it... Where's my gun?</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_3042"><text>I got a mezomodificate, take it... Where's the weapon?</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_3043"><text>See? Hypermodificate! Well? Deal?</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_3044"><text>I cooked up an Absolute! Cool? Take it... Give me the weapon!</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_310"><text>You should understand yourself - ZONE! Few dare to venture far. Anyway, your order is completed, but you need to pick it up yourself. Take a little walk...</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_311"><text>What the hell, guys, have you completely lost it! What kind of scam is this? I walked here from Sultan, now you're sending me even further. You took the artifact, so provide the goods. Otherwise while I'm walking around you'll manage to disappear, try finding you later...</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_321"><text>To Cordon! That's how much walking! Three days to get there...</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_331"><text>Why three days? You'll get there in three-four hours... Go out through the ravine by the pole and head straight east... There's your Cordon... Easy!</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_322"><text>In the Swamp? How to get there faster? Walking around - couple days will pass!</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_332"><text>Why walk around? Go out and head south immediately, pass through the old gates, then along the path, and you'll come out right to the village... There they are - the Swamp...</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_323"><text>In the Swamp? How to get there faster? Walking around - couple days will pass!</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_333"><text>Why walk around? Go out and head south immediately, pass through the old gates, then along the path, and you'll come out right to the village... There they are - the Swamp...</text></string>
<string id="lost_vil_stalker_dom_dialog_start_312"><text>Don't yell, this ain't a toy store with home delivery. We can't keep all the goods on ourselves, isn't it clear what we explained? Don't worry - everything's taken care of and arranged, we're a solid outfit, nobody complained. You'll find your order where indicated, and you'll thank us for hiding it so reliably. So that's it, topic closed. Payment received - pick up the goods anytime.</text></string>
<!-- new_reduction -->
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_101"><text>Hello, Marked One. How are you? Sorry I dragged out our meeting for so long. Believe me, I had good reasons.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_102"><text>Well, hello. I was already planning to go to you myself, thankfully they told me where to find you. I have a ton of questions. But let's go in order.\nI read your note in the Agroprom underground. You were there and said something to me, right?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_103"><text>Yes, I visited, but... You were badly shell-shocked, Marked One. You were delirious. And said strange things. Strelok once said very similar things...</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_104"><text>So you knew Strelok? Why didn't you say anything before?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_105"><text>We were never friends. Met a few times, no more than that. So I couldn't tell you much about Strelok anyway. Where he is now - I don't know. Nobody's seen him in the Zone for a long time.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_106"><text>Suppose so. And what did I say in delirium?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_107"><text>Mostly all kinds of incoherent stuff... about the Monolith. Very strange. Right before trouble happened to Fang, he told me that Strelok talked to him about the Monolith and also about some fragment of the Monolith. I didn't understand him then. And Ghost said that Strelok met with some Ivar and asked him about cases of psychosis and hallucinations connected to the Monolith or its fragment. He said that Strelok got this idea that the Monolith is just an illusion or it creates some kind of illusion itself... something like that.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_108"><text>Speaking of Ivar. You recently visited him at the Bar, as I understand? He's gotten a bit better, if you're interested. From his words, he gave you some of Strelok's notes and other papers, right? I need them.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_109"><text>I'm glad Ivar is recovering. And the notes... That's saying a lot, perhaps. More like excerpts from something. Probably part was lost, or Strelok himself didn't give everything, only what he considered necessary. Ivar couldn't explain it well. Or why he decided to give me these papers at all. Possibly he feared his consciousness would completely leave him or someone would take them while he was unconscious. You must read them.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_110"><text>I'll read them, of course. And in a nutshell - is there anything about Dark Valley and the laboratory beneath it?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_111"><text>Seems like that was in a separate folder. It had papers right from some laboratory. Can't say more precisely, too complicated for me. Have no idea where Strelok could have gotten it, but it came to Ivar along with other notes from him specifically.\nAnd you know... Strange things, to put it mildly, are described there. But it becomes clear why Ivar decided he was wrong to turn off the "Scorcher". If he took these fragments of information as truth, then his desire to return everything as it was is quite understandable.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_112"><text>What do you mean?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_113"><text>I get the impression that these aren't Strelok's notes, but rather excerpts from some newspaper, or scientific report, or his conversation with someone. I initially thought it was drafts of a fantasy story. Such... unusual things are described there. But if you compare what's written there with various information we have about the Zone now, everything looks quite plausible. One could assume it's someone's hypothesis and only that. And not necessarily Strelok's own.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_1141"><text>Yeah... And how do you think Strelok could have gotten all these plans, blueprints, schemes and other stuff concerning the "Scorcher"? One nerd told me it was a secret facility before, and information about it can only be found in special archives. And there it might lie classified for half a century. Wait... What if Strelok is some kind of agent? That would explain a lot...</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_1142"><text>Yeah... And how do you think Strelok could have gotten all these plans, blueprints, schemes and other stuff concerning the "Scorcher"? I think you can't find information about such facilities in open access. It's surely secret and all that. Wait... What if Strelok is some kind of agent? That would explain a lot...</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_115"><text>Come on, what kind of security agent is he? Of course, he had various oddities about him, but believe me, he doesn't look like a special service operative. He was too... not of this world, somehow.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_116"><text>You said it yourself! What if Strelok is just a regular psycho? Or not quite regular, but nonetheless, one of the same patients as Ivar. Made up all kinds of nonsense and leads people by the nose... Although no. I don't believe this version myself.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_117"><text>Stop it! Don't get worked up. Though we rarely saw each other with Strelok, he always seemed like a very reasonable person to me. Instead of building empty hypotheses, better do something practical.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_118"><text>You're probably right. Alright, we'll solve problems as they come. First need to figure out the papers you gave me and find a way to start the "Scorcher" again. I have a good consultant in mind at the Bar who can help with this.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_119"><text>Right approach, constructive. Good luck!</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_201"><text>Hello, Marked One... Come in, we'll have some tea.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_aver_start_dialog_301"><text>Good to see you.</text></string>

<string id="doktor_serios_dialog_0"><text>There, on Agroprom, you wrote that you need to "lay low", what does that mean?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_serios_dialog_1"><text>Yes... You were in bad shape, and I thought it was better to write. But I wouldn't have left you if I hadn't seen that everything would be fine with you. That's why I described how to get out of there quickly and unnoticed. And I really needed to meet with Ghost, then urgently disappear for a while.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_serios_dialog_2"><text>I don't understand what kind of urgencies these are?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_serios_dialog_3"><text>The Zone, it's all the Zone... Sometimes we learn more about what's happening in it than someone would like. So I accidentally learned what I shouldn't have, as the "leaders" considered.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_serios_dialog_4"><text>What leaders? Duty leadership? They seem to accept you normally at the Bar.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_serios_dialog_5"><text>No. I don't want to drag you into this either... You see, the Zone for some people isn't a mystery of nature, but an ordinary raw material resource. And a resource that's apparently limitless. After all, the "raw materials" - artifacts - are constantly born in it out of nowhere, nothing needs to be done for development, just collect and get crazy profits, paying crumbs to collectors. But as always in this world, where big money smells, big problems begin. Of course, a limitless resource can't remain uncontrolled. Division of spheres of influence happens, contracts, pacts, agreements, force solutions finally. And so on. Everything as usual in our world. And as usual, you can't see the forest for the trees, and from below you don't see who's pulling the strings up there. And while you remain a cog and don't see how and why the whole mechanism works, they don't notice you either.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_serios_dialog_6"><text>And you, it seems, learned something about those who wind these clocks and don't let them stop?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_serios_dialog_7"><text>If I had learned about that, I think we wouldn't have met for a long time. I just accidentally found out something about certain "scientists" and relationships between supposedly "factions" that are actually all the same springs in a well-oiled mechanism for collecting raw resources. But... Thank God, everything settled down already, and I wouldn't want to raise this topic again. For your and my safety.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_serios_dialog_8"><text>Yeah, things... I was thinking myself that not everything's clean here. Well, to hell with all of them, I have my own problems up to my neck.</text></string>

<string id="doktor_artteleport_dialog_0"><text>The artifact you left for Fang to move through the teleport, what can you tell me about it?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_artteleport_dialog_1"><text>Any artifact, even completely useless at first glance, has some properties. The main property of "Compasses" is that many teleport bubbles respond to them, including the one I wrote to you about in the note.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_artteleport_dialog_2"><text>Uh... Remind me how it was.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_artteleport_dialog_3"><text>Well... Seems like the whole Zone is covered with some "wormholes", subspace tunnels. Some can be used. For this you need to "tune" the artifact and activate it on your belt. Then you enter the beginning of the tunnel - it's usually visible - sort of a translucent sphere - and it transports you to the end of the tunnel. True, the artifact itself "discharges" in the process, but the "charge" is enough for several transitions.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_artteleport_dialog_4"><text>Yes, that's clear. And how to tune the artifact? And how to "recharge" it again, you mentioned this?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_artteleport_dialog_5"><text>I know little about this. Ghost said that any arrangement of "Compass" crystals works for teleporting from here to the stash under Agroprom. But for other teleports it might not work.\nAs for "charging", this can be done at a special place in Red Forest. "Charging" - that's just how I put it. After all, I don't understand what happens to it and why this "wormhole" responds to it afterwards. Many mysteries in the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_artteleport_dialog_6"><text>What kind of place for "charging"? And what needs to be done?</text></string>
<string id="doktor_artteleport_dialog_7"><text>You need to place the artifact in the center of a former anomaly, something like a circle with mangled edges remained from it. I think an hour is enough.</text></string>
<string id="doktor_artteleport_dialog_8"><text>Hmm. I see. I'll try it sometime.</text></string>

<string id="diador_start_dialog_101"><text>I greet you, stalker... What do you seek in this world of evil and mercy?</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_102"><text>Uh... Why are you being so grandiose?</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_103"><text>I mourn for the innocently slain... For immature souls that have fallen into the temptation of evil and greed. But I also rejoice for those who feel the strength within themselves to overcome this earthly pain and reach a new level of understanding unity with the mind of the universe...\nWho are you? Are you capable of accepting and knowing revelation?</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_104"><text>I-I don't know! I remember nothing from my past life. They called me Marked One. Here's the mark on my hand, because of it... And who are you?</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_105"><text>Don't grieve over absent memories! The time will come - everything will return... Call me Diodor. Some say Father Diodor! But I don't think names mean anything to one who sees with inner vision...\nI will pray for you, Marked One. For there is strength in you!\nGo and find what you seek, and do what you must! This is my blessing to you...</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_1051"><text>Listen... father. What does your... uh... religion say about a person who has lost their memory? Maybe there's some prayer for such a case that would help?</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_1052"><text>I understand what you're talking about... In any difficulty a person faces - whether spiritual or physical - sincere prayer with true faith in the heart will provide help and do its work. But you must not forget that a person doesn't fall into difficult circumstances simply by someone's evil whim, he himself is the cause of his difficulties. His sins, his evil deeds lead to this. But this also instills hope and confidence, for if you got yourself into it, then you yourself will find the way out... There are many ways to fall, but there is one sure path to salvation...</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_106"><text>Alright, alright, I already understood that there is salvation... How these religious figures love to explain everything so confusingly... I'll go. Farewell.</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_107"><text>Father Diodor, then. I think there's no other priest in these parts?</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_108"><text>I'm not a priest, I just worry about human souls... What do you need a priest for? Church rituals aren't dogma, the holy spirit is within everyone, you just need to see it...</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_109"><text>There's this guy. He buried a friend recently. Says maybe you'll meet someone who can pray for his soul, asks to come to the church in the Swamp...</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_110"><text>Well then... Care for the deceased is a good deed. I will direct my steps to where I'm needed. May you also have the strength to see wisdom beneath the surface grime. Go in peace...</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_111"><text>Alright, I'm going. Farewell...</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_201"><text>Be well, my son... What need leads you through these dreary places? There's no good here... Only injustice...</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_202"><text>Hello, hello, still preaching? Don't see particularly many followers?</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_203"><text>Man is blind... And too vain... The time will come - they will see clearly! But for some it will be too late! No one will even remember those who have departed. Souls and hearts grow callous! They don't feel the divine breath.</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_2031"><text>They will see clearly, you say... How can one feel it, this breath?</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_2032"><text>Everyone feels it differently. But the great Deity breathes. And its breath is the cycles of life and death. Everything in the world is subject to them. You will feel His exhale.</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_2041"><text>Uh-huh. And with it my last breath? *knock on wood*... Alright, maybe something will be revealed to me too.</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_2042"><text>I think there's no other priest in these parts?</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_205"><text>I'm not a priest, I just worry about human souls... What do you need a priest for? Church rituals aren't dogma, the holy spirit is within everyone, you just need to see it...</text></string>

<string id="diador_start_dialog_207"><text>Well then... Care for the deceased is a good deed. I will direct my steps to where I'm needed. May you also have the strength to see wisdom beneath the surface grime. Go in peace...</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_208"><text>Alright, I'm going. Farewell...</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_301"><text>Mind of the universe, be with you! Marked One!</text></string>
<string id="diador_start_dialog_302"><text>Thanks for the kind word...</text></string>

<string id="esc_diador_start_dialog_101"><text>I greet you, stalker... What do you seek in this world of evil and injustice?</text></string>
<string id="esc_diador_start_dialog_102"><text>Uh... Why are you being so grandiose? And what happened here?</text></string>

<string id="esc_diador_start_dialog_201"><text>Peace to you, Marked One... May light touch your soul...</text></string>
<string id="esc_diador_start_dialog_202"><text>Light? What light? I'm looking for Strelok...</text></string>
<string id="esc_diador_start_dialog_203"><text>Strelok made peace with himself, and now he is no longer the same. And you too are not the same... And therefore we all go toward awareness of our chosen nature... Go and seek...</text></string>
<string id="esc_diador_start_dialog_2041"><text>Mmm-yeah... Alright, I'll go.</text></string>

<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_101"><text>Good to you, Marked One, and may your soul not desire evil.</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_102"><text>Good... I don't see any good yet, just evil all around.</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_103"><text>There's much evil, yes. But what people call good also grows in human souls as a tender shoot... Here you did good - helped calm the restless shade of a beardless youth who left this world before his time. This is small good. But! Good nonetheless! And from such seeds will grow and ripen the field of human happiness. Maybe not immediately, maybe we won't live to see the fruits, but it will be and it will be boundless... It simply cannot be otherwise...</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_104"><text>So why do good if there's no benefit from it?</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_105"><text>There is benefit, it's just that a person cannot see all the consequences that follow his choice as he follows his path. Life doesn't consist of momentary acts of retribution. Every string of being that you touch creates its chord, which weaves into the symphony of the great mystery of existence. And the sum of these chords can be so beautiful that a person will be given a sense of belonging to a universe of blessings. A universe from which one can take infinitely...</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_1051"><text>Well yeah, like "I will repay all" and all that... But where is it?</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_1052"><text>Right here... Look around, ask yourself: what do I want?</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_106"><text>Uh... I want? Probably to find myself.</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_107"><text>There. You expressed what your small good deed rewards you with. You found a piece of yourself. The sum of these pieces will give you complete finding... Or would it be better to receive "thirty pieces of silver" for good? Think about it...</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_108"><text>I'll think about it, alright...</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_201"><text>Peace to you, Marked One... I remember, you wanted to find Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_202"><text>Well yes. I wanted. Rather - I want. Any information?</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_203"><text>Strelok went through a portal. The one that opens only to the chosen. This portal is right there - in the very heart of the apocalypse... The Entity opens it. This Entity is not from our world. Stalkers call it - MONOLITH. If you want to understand yourself - turn to the Entity...</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_204"><text>Mmm-yeah... Those are just rumors...</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_205"><text>Rumors are never born from nothing. Believe and accept. There is someone who came from there. And who told me this truth. Just don't ask - who. That cannot be the right path.</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_206"><text>Monolith? Oh, father... Alright, I'll go.</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_301"><text>When you're "there" - you'll get what you seek. And whether "Marked One" remains - only you will decide.</text></string>
<string id="diador_marsh_dialog_302"><text>Yes. Me. To decide.</text></string>

<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_0"><text>Listen, what's this truck? Looks like it arrived recently?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_1"><text>Yeah, appeared quite recently. With these trucks it's generally unclear what... they appear, disappear.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_2"><text>How so?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_3"><text>Yeah, it happened before. About a month or two ago another truck appeared, came whistling from somewhere near Radar, passed the checkpoint and almost drove to the warehouses. Stopped right at the gates, suddenly stopped just like that... and silence. Our guys went to see what kind of weirdo it was, but there was nobody behind the wheel. What a thing! They wanted to use it, brought gasoline, looked, but there was nowhere to pour it. That is, it's like a toy, only big - outside it's a truck, but inside it's solid... not metal, but sort of like... can't even explain. Unclear how it even drove. Miracles... They say there's such an anomaly - called "Labyrinth". That's where such "miracles" sometimes appear from... Anyway, go to our Cook, he was saying something about those "Labyrinths". While drunk, true, but still... Sometimes even he has bright thoughts.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_4"><text>And then what?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_5"><text>Nothing. It just stood there, for about a week probably. And one morning everyone rubbed their eyes, looked, and the truck was gone... vanished, as if it dissolved, only some slime remained in that spot... took a long time to dry. And who could have taken it away? Or maybe it vanished by itself. Came by itself - left by itself. So we're waiting now to see what happens with this truck.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_6"><text>I didn't understand about "like a toy", no motor at all?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_7"><text>Well yeah... Why are you pestering me about your truck anyway! Don't you have anything else to do?\nIf you're bored, then go check one place. It's not far... on Radar. If you go by road, you'll come to a fork. There aren't many beasts there, they mainly live in the forest. At the crossroads turn north, there the road leads to an old tunnel. The "Brain Scorcher", with its radiation, doesn't reach there, you can pass freely. That's where you need to visit.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_8"><text>What do I need it for? You could go yourself.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_9"><text>If I could go myself, I wouldn't ask you. So how about it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_91"><text>On Radar?! No way. I'm not ready for such heroics.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_92"><text>And what to look for there? Can you be more specific.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_110"><text>Several days ago, our fighters went that way. They should have returned by now, but they're still not here. Hope that they're alive is slim, of course, but still. Would like to know what happened there. They took a PKM with them, if you happen to find it, bring it back. I won't forget the favor. It's tough here without it. You can see yourself how many beasts come from Radar.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_zil_mmz_111"><text>Deal. If I find out or find something, I'll drop by.</text></string>
<string id="tex_mil_freedom_commander"><text>Cap, the Freedom commander at the Barrier, asks to check the old tunnel in the northern part of Radar where their fighters went. Need to find out what happened there. If I happen to find the PKM, need to return it to the Barrier.</text></string>

<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_0"><text>I'm here about your request, about the radar tunnel.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_1"><text>And what's there? Did you see anything?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_21"><text>Nothing there. Just mutants and radiation.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_22"><text>I saw your fighters. They had bad luck, all dead. A family of burers made that tunnel their home.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_31"><text>Pity, great pity. Wanted to commemorate them, like humans. But so... we'll consider - the Zone took them.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_32"><text>Did you find anything or just bodies?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_41"><text>Everything can be blamed on it. See ya.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_42"><text>Found... PKM machine gun, couple boxes for it, grenades, medicine, provisions... Looks like a military depot. Seems it wasn't their first time there. Don't you want to say anything? Very interesting what they were looking for there.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_5"><text>What do you want to know? Yes, they went, and not once. But I didn't send them there. Why they went - I can only guess. And the one who knows won't tell you. Better not to ask. Remember what happened to curious Varvara. So understood?\nAnd that little machine gun was good support for us. Return it... I ask as a brother.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_6"><text>Nasty organization you have, as I see it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_7"><text>Oh, a moralist showed up. We're not like that, life is like that. Especially here, where you and I stand. And we're part of this nasty life.\nAlright, no lectures. For the machine gun I can give a recipe how to get the "Crystal Soul" modificate. If you don't need it, then I offer an artifact, rather a capsule... found it in the swamp yesterday. Decide.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_81"><text>Take your machine gun and give me the recipe. I'll see what comes of it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_82"><text>Give me the capsule and take your iron, it's pulled down all my shoulders.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_83"><text>You'll manage without the machine gun. Freedom, damn you...</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_91"><text>Don't get too ambitious. After all, I didn't drive you beyond the Barrier... Sent the recipe to your PDA. And don't be offended.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_92"><text>Don't get too ambitious. After all, I didn't drive you beyond the Barrier... Take the capsule. I sense there's an excellent artifact inside. And don't be offended.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x12_10"><text>I'll go, "getting ambitious"... he says.</text></string>

<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x8_0"><text>I'm here about that matter you talked about.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x8_1"><text>Made up your mind? I already went myself.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x8_2"><text>Went yourself?! So maybe there was something there after all, eh?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x8_3"><text>Maybe there was... what's it to you? You didn't go when I asked.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_after_x8_4"><text>Well yeah, but still...</text></string>
<!-- ????? ??????????? ???????? ? ?????? -->
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_0"><text>I need to reload my flamethrower.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_11"><text>What, your hands withered away? Can't change the canister yourself?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_21"><text>I don't have a canister. That's why I came to you. Prapor said you can help with this.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_31"><text>Well, say so right away then. Canisters with mixture, as you probably guess, aren't bought often, and it's dangerous stuff, this hellchemistry, so I don't keep more than one at my place. If they buy one, I make an order and within a day they bring me a new one. Right now I happen to have a canister in stock. Will you take it?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_12"><text>Well, what to do with you, sickly? I already explained about the canisters.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_22"><text>I came for the canister. Just expressed myself poorly.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_321"><text>However you express yourself, I can't help - there's been no "delivery" yet.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_322"><text>And I was thinking - hello again. Alright, I have the goods.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_421"><text>Got it. I'll come by later then.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_41"><text>Here, take your thousands.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_42"><text>I have a simple little artifact, take it.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_43"><text>Turns out expensive. Maybe you'll give a discount for old friendship?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_51"><text>Yeah, alright. Take the canister with fire mixture, and watch it, be careful, don't shake it, or it'll blow right here...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_flame_reload_dialog_53"><text>If I start giving discounts to everyone like this, I'll very soon be left with a bare ass. In short, no profit - no talk.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_new_pda_dialog_0"><text>My PDA croaked...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_new_pda_dialog_1"><text>So? Such trouble happens. And you really need it?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_new_pda_dialog_2"><text>Yes, I'm used to it. Convenient money calculations, has a map, and I wrote down some things for memory... Maybe it can be... repaired?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_new_pda_dialog_3"><text>Repaired? That, brother, is not for me. If you really need it - I'll get you a new one, not a fly sat on it! And just a couple simple artifacts. No? Then no...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_new_pda_dialog_41"><text>Alright, here's a couple little artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_new_pda_dialog_42"><text>I'd better look for someone to repair it...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_new_pda_dialog_5"><text>Well, that's right. Here, take this. Don't mind that it's a bit scratched, and there's a stain on the back.\nBlood, or what?\nCome on, it's not for showing off! It works - that's fine!\nI entered you in the database, now this will be your identifier.\nWell, take it...</text></string>

<string id="sidor_new_pda_val_dialog_0"><text>I need a new PDA. I... lost my old one.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_new_pda_val_dialog_1"><text>It happens. To newcomers I give them free, of course, but you already got one. The second will cost you just a couple simple artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_new_pda_val_dialog_21"><text>No problem. Here, take these.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_new_pda_val_dialog_22"><text>Wow! I'll think about whether I need it for such a price...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_new_pda_val_dialog_3"><text>Wait... This one won't turn on, let's try another... So, yeah. Done, I entered you in the database, now this will be your identifier.</text></string>

<string id="vergas_klava_info_dlg_0"><text>Listen, old man, here's the thing: I'm looking for one item, seems like your work.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_info_dlg_1"><text>Yeah? And what is it?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_info_dlg_2"><text>A notebook, electronic. I was told you apparently made such things.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_info_dlg_3"><text>Ahem... Didn't think anyone would still be interested in them. About a month and a half ago one stalker somewhere found a bunch of non-working old model smartphones, brought them to me, so I converted several into electronic notepads with expanded memory. But who needs such things? Text information is easier to store in PDA. Everything you need is at hand there.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_info_dlg_4"><text>Well, consider that I needed such a device. Maybe you'll sell one?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_info_dlg_5"><text>Are you kidding? In all this time I only managed to sell one, gave away the rest. First to acquaintances, then just to whoever wanted them.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_info_dlg_6"><text>Damn! Really not one left? Got my hopes up, turns out...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_info_dlg_7"><text>You need it that badly? Actually, there's one option. In that single gadget I managed to sell, number eight if memory serves, by the buyer's request I installed a special beacon for geolocation. Sort of like, so it could be found in case of loss. But it seemed to me it was for some other purpose. Be that as it may, I know the working frequency. I even took coordinates several times out of curiosity. I can try to get current ones now. If it works out, you can use them to find the buyer and talk him into reselling the notepad to you.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_info_dlg_8"><text>Nothing else left anyway, so go ahead, act. What will I owe?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_info_dlg_91"><text>I have some conscience, such as it is. I said I gave away these notepads for free, so I won't take anything from you. Now wait a bit while I catch the signal...\nAha, found it! You're lucky, it's quite close to our village. Now I'll drop the coordinates. Done.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_info_dlg_92"><text>I have some conscience, such as it is. I said I gave away these notepads for free, so I won't take anything from you. Now wait a bit while I catch the signal...\nHmm... No signal. Maybe the battery just died, or maybe something worse happened. Wait... I'm dropping the last tracked coordinates. The chance is small, of course, that you'll catch the buyer at this location, since several days have passed, but it's near our village. I'd take a walk if I were you. If you do manage to get the notepad but in non-working condition, bring it over. Maybe I'll revive it.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_info_dlg_10"><text>Thanks! Stay healthy, Vergas!</text></string>

<string id="vergas_klava_rep_dlg_0"><text>I found that electronic notepad by your tip. Only it doesn't work, as expected. Will you take a look?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_rep_dlg_1"><text>Let's have a look. So you made a deal with the owner? How is he?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_rep_dlg_2"><text>No deal whatsoever. I took the device off a dead bandit's body. Here it is, take it.\nSomething tells me this ain't the buyer you were talking about at all.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_rep_dlg_3"><text>A bandit? No, the buyer looked like a regular stalker. Let's hope he just got robbed and is still alive.\nSo, what do we have here? As I thought, the battery is damaged. Flooded with something. And it's specific here, won't fit one from, say, a PDA.\nI know that several smartphones from which I cooked up these notepads ended up with Sidorovich. Maybe he still hasn't pawned them off on anyone or tossed them. Go ask him. I'll only need the battery.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_rep_dlg_4"><text>Got it. I'll have words with that cheapskate.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_klava_rep_dlg_0"><text>Vergas said some stalker brought you smartphones about a month and a half ago. I need a battery from one of those smartphones.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_klava_rep_dlg_1"><text>What do you need it for? Got the same thing and it croaked? Want a replacement? Regular phones don't work in the Zone anyway. Practically. Or are you running games on it?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_klava_rep_dlg_2"><text>Why is my business. Just tell me - you got one or not?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_klava_rep_dlg_3"><text>Gimme any artifact like a Jellyfish, Wrenched, or same class, and you'll have your battery. Still lying around in the storeroom.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_klava_rep_dlg_4"><text>Hold on, let me check what I got for artifacts.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_klava_done_dlg_0"><text>I'm here for that smartphone battery. Remember, we had a talk?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_klava_done_dlg_1"><text>I remember. And do you remember the price?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_klava_done_dlg_21"><text>Wouldn't have come otherwise. Take the artifact.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_klava_done_dlg_22"><text>We agreed on a simple artifact, I think... Wait, let me double-check what I got.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_klava_done_dlg_3"><text>A king's word is harder than peas! Take it.</text></string>

<string id="vergas_klava_rep_start_dlg_0"><text>I made a deal with Sidor, got a new battery for repairing the notepad. Here.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_rep_start_dlg_1"><text>Yes, exactly the one I need. Good thing that old scammer didn't con you by slipping something bogus. You don't know much about this stuff, as I understand.\nAlright, now give me about 15 minutes to quietly replace the battery and run tests.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_rep_start_dlg_2"><text>No problem, I'll go get some fresh air.</text></string>

<string id="vergas_klava_rep_done_dlg_0"><text>What about that electronic notepad? Did you test it? Working?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_rep_done_dlg_11"><text>I'm not done yet, wait a bit.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_rep_done_dlg_12"><text>Yes, the device is in perfect order, only all the memory got wiped, so now it's completely clean. All yours.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_rep_done_dlg_21"><text>Waiting.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_klava_rep_done_dlg_22"><text>Thanks, you saved me.</text></string>

<string id="deadcity_botan_glavn_dialog_start_101"><text>Greetings, respected... You've wandered quite far, we haven't seen a new face for several days. What should we call you?</text></string>
<string id="deadcity_botan_glavn_dialog_start_102"><text>Greetings. They call me Marked One. Yeah, didn't expect to meet so many people here. What are you researching?</text></string>
<string id="deadcity_botan_glavn_dialog_start_103"><text>Pleased to meet you. Valentin Nikolayevich, head of the monitoring group. Trying to get reliable data on mass-transportation anomalous phenomena. Also gathering additional statistics on the side. We're always short on working hands, so if you'd like to earn some money...</text></string>
<string id="deadcity_botan_glavn_dialog_start_201"><text>Ah! It's you, Marked One... What did you want?</text></string>
<string id="deadcity_botan_glavn_dialog_start_301"><text>Marked One, how good that you stopped by! We have strange things happening here. Perhaps you, as an experienced stalker, could help us...</text></string>
<string id="deadcity_botan_glavn_dialog_start_401"><text>So, did you manage to clarify the situation?</text></string>
<string id="deadcity_botan_glavn_dialog_start_501"><text>Good to see you, Marked One. Everything successful? Can I help you with anything?</text></string>

<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_101"><text>Greetings, good man. Sit down... Maybe some tea?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_102"><text>Thank you. Won't refuse, I guess... What are you doing here?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_103"><text>Me? Well, this... I guide the youth who want to risk and find something that'll make life sweet as honey... I live nearby, beyond the Cordon. I'm Stepanych. Everyone here knows me!</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_104"><text>So you're a guide? And know the reliable paths?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_105"><text>I know some things... can smell some things out, but there are places that even I don't go... And wouldn't let others either. This is the edge of that damned Zone, and all the dangers are known... Well, boars, dogs, those pigs... Of course they're not like normal ones anymore, but with a decent rifle and some skill - no problem taking them down... But there, further... Who knows...\nAnd what's your name?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_106"><text>Marked One... Something like that...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_107"><text>I see... Could've not asked, there's your name - written all over your face... You drink tea... Well, sorry, it'll get cold.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_201"><text>Greetings again... Still wandering around? Looking for something?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_301"><text>Still wandering around? Looking for something?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_302"><text>I need to get to the Cordon, could you show me?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_303"><text>Cough... I would, of course, show you just like that, I like you... But I got an old wife, daughter with two little ones - alone, without a man... I gotta help them. You give me some artifact, and I'll show you how to get to the Cordon safely... A good artifact... Got enough junk already...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_304"><text>Well I got one. Will third level do?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_3041"><text>I got this dummy here...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_305"><text>There, that's just it. Don't be mad, son... Life's hard for us. Look here, you'll leave the hamlet this way, and go along this path... I put markers there. If it's red - go around to the left, and green - to the right... Remember that. Well, good luck...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_306"><text>Cunning, old man... Well alright, maybe we'll see each other again...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_401"><text>Greetings, son... Still can't find peace, I see? What are you looking for?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_4021"><text>There should be a path to the military base, at Agroprom?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_4022"><text>Dropped by to say hello. Still smoking, Stepanych...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_403"><text>Yes, there's such a path. I guided boys there... Only no one came back. So... I'll tell you straight - life's gotten hard. There are almost no artifacts left that you can get decent money for, and I gotta help my grandchildren... Their father ain't around... I ask you to give me an artifact for a safe path. A good artifact, expensive...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_4041"><text>Got third level, will it do?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_4042"><text>I got this dummy here.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_4043"><text>Maybe you'll take a couple second levels?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_405"><text>Good. Wait! Now we can rest a bit... And the path... Look here - you know where that locomotive stands on the rails? Well, to the north... Pass it, and there, when there's a red marker, you take a bit to the right from it and go, and if it's green - go around to the left. If you see a blue one, be especially careful - some stalker died there... Well, God be with you...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_406"><text>I'll remember, farewell, Stepanych...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_501"><text>Come through, son... Have some tea... Good tea...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_502"><text>Thanks... I'll go further, maybe learn something new...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_503"><text>Well, look out. Be careful, maybe you'll stay alive...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_dialog_start_601"><text>Why are you wandering around at night? Better rest, or you'll find death in the dark somewhere...</text></string>

<string id="kordon_end_oksana_start_dialog_101"><text>What do you want? I'll get by perfectly fine without you! Goodbye!</text></string>
<string id="kordon_end_oksana_start_dialog_102"><text>Uh-huh...</text></string>
<string id="kordon_end_oksana_start_dialog_201"><text>Well, what? Going much further? Maybe let's go?</text></string>
<string id="kordon_end_oksana_start_dialog_202"><text>Not far, let's go...</text></string>

<string id="sidor_dollars_have_0"><text>I've seen some stalkers around here with old rubles...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_have_1"><text>Ah! You mean Soviet ones? Yeah... Main currency here in the Zone, I mean...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_have_2"><text>But that's not serious! The Union's been gone for almost thirty years...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_have_3"><text>Well how should I explain it to you...\nStalkers mainly come here to earn money. No one brings normal money with them. But you need to eat, drink, buy bullets... So we old-timers, so to speak, decided to use these old rubles. Back in the very beginning, when the first people climbed in here for artifacts, one respected person found a whole wagon with old Soviet rubles. Good paper - didn't deteriorate at all over all these years.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_have_4"><text>But you transfer money from PDA? And what do stalkers need these rubles for afterwards?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_have_5"><text>Eh, Marked One... This is the ZONE! How can you completely trust some electronic gadget! And about why need rubles afterwards, I'll tell you this - if you manage to earn a decent sum in these paper bills, come to me, I'll honestly write you a bearer check to one of the respectable banks. And you'll be able to get whatever currency is closer to your heart... Understand?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_have_6"><text>Hmm... I assume this isn't exactly a clean scheme... And how can I be sure you won't screw me over?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_have_7"><text>You seem like a grown man, but you're talking nonsense! Is my life really worth less to me than a dozen or two dollars... I've been sitting here for more than a year, and I'm alive, as you can see. That's the guarantee!\nIn general, decide for yourself, if you want to save your blood-earned money - come to me, I'll convert your paper bills for a small percentage...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_have_8"><text>We'll see, we'll see...</text></string>

<string id="sidor_dollars_change_0"><text>I want to convert rubles to hard currency.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_change_1"><text>Right decision! How much do you want to convert? Only let's do it like this: we won't mess around with small change, agreed? My exchange rate for now is - for 50 thousand rubles I'll write a check for a thousand dollars. Plus my percentage, naturally. Total... Hmm... I wish I had a surname like that! Alright. You got fifty-five grand on your account?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_change_21"><text>Got it, got it... Write it up.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_change_22"><text>You're taking too much percentage!</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_change_23"><text>Don't have that much on my PDA...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_change_31"><text>The office writes! And Sidorovich does business! Here's your check. Don't lose it, it's bearer. I advise hiding it well - who knows!</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_change_32"><text>What did you expect? Lady "Freebie" doesn't live in the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_change_33"><text>Well, when you have it - come by. You understand yourself: PDA is unreliable. Your encoding crashes - and consider there's nothing...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dollars_change_4"><text>Alright, I'm off on business.</text></string>

<string id="barmen_dollars_change_0"><text>I need a bearer check in greenbacks. How about it, can we work something out?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_dollars_change_1"><text>Any whim for your money! You know my exchange rate? Check for a thousand dollars for 55 thousand rubles from your PDA, plus my percentage. Total: 60 thousand rubles. Got that much?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_dollars_change_21"><text>Yeah, got it. Write the check.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_dollars_change_22"><text>You're taking too much percentage!</text></string>
<string id="barmen_dollars_change_23"><text>Don't have that much...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_dollars_change_31"><text>Here you go! You can cash it anytime at this solid bank!</text></string>
<string id="barmen_dollars_change_32"><text>My job is to offer. Don't like it - find somewhere cheaper.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_dollars_change_33"><text>Come by when you get enough.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_dollars_change_4"><text>Alright, I'm off on business.</text></string>

<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_0"><text>Nimble, what was that sawmill you mentioned?</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_1"><text>Don't know?! In the Guts - that's what we call the area - there's an old sawmill, not far from the dirt road that leads to the destroyed overpass. There's like a small hunter base there. They shoot mutants on orders, and just like that - make stuffed animals. Fun folk, they distill moonshine - would raise the dead! What do they make it from? Don't even want to know, afraid it won't go down my throat...\nLast time I was going to the Cordon, I stopped by there to rest. Well, took a shot of rotgut, can't just sit by the fire with men dry. Ended up getting so plastered that I wandered off toward the gas station, and that's where I was lucky enough to stumble onto that stash, damn it...</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_21"><text>What kind of stash? Judging by the look of it, you're not too happy with your find...</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_22"><text>So it was you who found the green box with the jacket inside?</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_31"><text>Not the find itself, but what happened after. You could say because of that stash I ended up captured by bandits, but I don't want to talk about it now. I found a cool jacket though. Sturdy, with chain mail lining. I already made a deal with one rookie in the village - he's willing to pay good money for it. Problem is, I gotta go get it first... Thing is, I had to drop it while running from blind dogs. But it's here, nearby, by the railway tunnel, well, the one you can get through to the old hospital, or was it a departmental sanatorium before - don't know exactly. Doesn't matter anyway. I feel awkward asking, but... would you agree to go look for my jacket? I still can't get over that story with the bandits...</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_32"><text>Yeah. Good jacket, sturdy, with chain mail lining. I already made a deal with one rookie in the village - he's willing to pay good money for it. Just gotta go pick it up, probably still lying where I dropped it, by the railway tunnel, well, the one you can get through to the old hospital, or was it a departmental sanatorium before - don't know exactly. Doesn't matter anyway. Listen, I feel awkward asking, but... would you agree to go look for my jacket? I still can't get over that story with the bandits...</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_41"><text>Wait, about this Sanatorium, can you properly explain how to get there? And where can you exit from it?</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_42"><text>Wait, I'm a bit confused. You got out to the Cordon through this Sanatorium, right? How did you end up there?</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_51"><text>I'm telling you: here, at the Cordon, you can get in through the railway tunnel if you're not afraid of getting a decent dose of radiation, of course. Also from the Guts, through the destroyed overpass. In the Sanatorium itself there's an inconspicuous door under the stairs, that's the exit back. Let me mark on your map the passages I know about, or you'll forget...\nThere. So about my jacket, will you help?</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_52"><text>Obviously how. I came in from the Guts, through the destroyed railway bridge. Didn't I tell you already? And in the Sanatorium there's an inconspicuous door under the stairs, that's the exit back. Let me mark on your map the passages I know about, or you'll forget again...\nThere. So about my jacket, will you help?</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_6"><text>And what's the point for me to mess with this? I already risked my head once getting you out of captivity, but there I at least had my own reasons. And now?</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_7"><text>What you risked for me - I won't forget that, indebted till my grave. Now for this small favor from you, I offer good compensation: I got one stash for a rainy day, I'll tell you how to find it. Or you can take it in money. Or there's some gear - the guys shared. Fair enough?\nI should warn you right away - today the guy I made the deal with still has money, but tomorrow he might decide to blow it all somewhere, and then I'm screwed. So don't drag it out too much with the search, okay? Try to manage within a day. And one more thing. If you want to wear the jacket yourself, then show it to Vergas afterwards, let him patch it up and clean it if needed. Otherwise, I'm afraid the rookie might balk if I show him the goods all torn up and stained. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_81"><text>Alright. I'll try to take a look, but I'm not promising anything! Got any ideas where to start looking?</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_82"><text>No. Too many conditions, and the payoff is questionable. Go get your own threads.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_91"><text>On the north side of the embankment there's a fallen tree. Look there. Good luck!</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_dialog_92"><text>Your call, your call.</text></string>

<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_0"><text>I'm about that jacket you lost.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_1"><text>What, found it? I wasn't even hoping anymore...</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_21"><text>Yeah, found it where you described. Here.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_22"><text>Nice little jacket. I'll keep it for now.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_3"><text>You're the man! I got some money - about five grand. Or maybe you need a dosimeter to detect radiation? Then I'll throw in some batteries and anti-rad, in case you still manage to catch a dose.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_41"><text>Hmm, give me the dosimeter, it'll come in handy.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_42"><text>Better money, got some ideas...</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_43"><text>You mentioned something about a stash...</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_51"><text>Second time you're helping me out! Thanks! Take it!</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_52"><text>Second time you're helping me out! Thanks! I'll transfer the money to your account now.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_531"><text>About the stash? Oh, right, I mentioned... Only it's not really mine. I overheard a conversation between two hunters. One was telling the other that he dropped a backpack with a good artifact when he was running from a herd of angry flesh.\nI didn't catch everything, but it's somewhere in the northern part of the Guts, not far from the road that leads to the Valley. Near a truck frame it's lying.\nThat hunter was later torn apart by dogs near the old regional committee dacha. Saw it myself when I was returning to the Cordon. I wanted to go look for that stash, would've come in handy for a rainy day. But then I figured screw it and spat on it. When I remember that last trip there and how it ended... Anyway, look for it yourself. And... thanks. Second time you're helping me out.</text></string>

<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_6"><text>Yeah, the local dogs are scarier than wolves. Almost tore me apart myself.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_7"><text>Tell me about it. They don't even have eyes, but somehow they sense you. Oh, by the way! There's an artifact that scares them off, heard about such a thing? I don't know why, but when you hang such an art on your belt, the dogs scatter in fear. Our guys call it "Bubble" - it looks like a yellowish ball...</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_8"><text>Holy crap! And where can I find one, you know?</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_outfit_reward_9"><text>Mmm... Well alright, you helped me after all. Basically, I saw one in the Sanatorium when I was crawling through there last time. Watched from afar a burer that seemed to be playing with just such an artifact. Burers love collecting all kinds of shiny things. Just watch out: going after a burer with bare hands is risky... Anyway, it's up to you. The artifact is certainly very useful for a stalker, I wouldn't refuse one myself.</text></string>

<string id="bar_docent_postmens_dialog_0"><text>You want to ask something?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_postmens_dialog_1"><text>I heard you've been to Yantar? Not planning to go there again?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_postmens_dialog_2"><text>Well, I've been... I'm planning to go many places, what did you want?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_postmens_dialog_3"><text>Need to pass a note to Sakharov. Nothing special - just a small list of items. He'll understand.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_postmens_dialog_4"><text>Go ahead, write it, I'll wait for now.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_postmens_dialog_5"><text>I'll write it right in front of you, don't go far.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_postmens_dialog_6"><text>Wait, what are you writing on? See, there's something written by hand on the back... Where did you get this paper?</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_postmens_dialog_7"><text>What? Oh... Petrenko gave me the paper for various "technical" needs, ask him where he got it... don't interfere for now... So, here's everything - pass the note when you get a chance. Not urgent, but if there's an opportunity - definitely pass it, don't forget.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_postmens_dialog_8"><text>Alright. Let me read what's on the back for now.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_postmens_dialog_9"><text>Not now.</text></string>
<string id="bar_docent_postmens_dialog_91"><text>Well alright, I'll pass it with someone else...</text></string>
<string id="postmens_text_1"><text>Note to Sakharov from Docent. Nothing interesting, but on the back is a fragment of some letter.\n\n"...Alyoshenka, son, you try not to stick your neck out there. I know it's silly to ask you, but understand me too - I heard they're shooting there. Lord, what's happening, it's a peaceful area - not some Iraq, and I can't find peace. Try to get assigned as a clerk somewhere, so God forbid some fool doesn't shoot you... Wait, here's father, wants to add something.\n\nAlexei, son! Don't let us down, prove there that our breed is the best. Keep up the honor, don't stick your neck out, but know how to fight back. And mother is somewhat right too, we're waiting, but there are no letters from you. Not much time left now. Well, for now. Write more often..."</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_postmens_dialog_0"><text>Docent asked me to pass a note, but he wrote it on the back of some letter, says you gave him the paper. Where from?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_postmens_dialog_1"><text>Well I gave it, so what? Our guys brought the paper from the Garbage, found some plastic bag. A bit wet, but they dried it - it's fine: what they gave for hygiene, and the blank pages were good for other business. What's it to you, you expecting a letter or something?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_postmens_dialog_2"><text>No, I don't have anyone to expect from. But maybe... I'd like to read it, maybe it would shed some light.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_postmens_dialog_3"><text>Light?.. Oh right, Barman told me something's wrong with your head, I completely forgot, sorry... Ask our guys at the Garbage, maybe they have some left - you can read it.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_postmens_dialog_4"><text>Unlikely... They have "hygiene" too. But I'll ask.</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_yantar_way_dialog_0"><text>I saw in the messages that you go to Yantar?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way_dialog_1"><text>Sometimes, to Yantar and other places. What's up?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way_dialog_2"><text>I need to get to Yantar. To Sakharov.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way_dialog_3"><text>What do you need him for? Even though stalkers chatter about Sakharov paying good money for artifacts, it's not entirely true.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way_dialog_4"><text>Someone is very sick. And only Sakharov might know how to help.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way_dialog_5"><text>Oh really? What a predicament... Alright, let's get to business. Let's make a deal - I need someone who could quickly run somewhere and talk about something. Then, for that same person, I could show how to get to Yantar. Understand?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way_dialog_6"><text>More specifically? Somewhere is a flexible concept...</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way_dialog_7"><text>Here's how it is... You probably know about the hunter base, the one at the sawmill in the Guts... According to my information, they've recently started offering a nice alternative to these canned goods and sausage. I'm interested in: can they establish regular supplies and in what volume. Also - samples would be nice to taste. If you make a deal with them - I won't forget it. We, Duty, value the word of a real man!</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way_dialog_81"><text>I've heard this somewhere before... Agreed.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way_dialog_82"><text>Maybe next time. I'm heading in the other direction now.</text></string>
<string id="tex_petrenko_yantar_way"><text>Colonel Petrenko, Duty's supply officer, asked me to bring sausage samples from the hunters in the Guts. In return, he promised to tell me about the road to Yantar</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_yantar_way2_dialog_0"><text>I talked to the hunters.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way2_dialog_1"><text>Took you long enough, I already sent someone else... But whatever, what's the story? Did you reach a consensus?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way2_dialog_2"><text>Seems like it, here, by the way, are samples of their grub...</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way2_dialog_3"><text>Aha, I see. Doesn't stink too much. We'll try feeding it to volunteers in our free time. But how is it in general?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way2_dialog_4"><text>The head hunter said they can provide food for about fifty people. If you can pay them properly.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_yantar_way2_dialog_5"><text>Fifty... Hmm... Probably enough. I should probably visit them myself. We'll discuss what kind of "payment" they want.\nWell, thanks to you.\nHere, take some ammo, probably spent some?\nAnd... You wanted to know the way to Sakharov at Yantar?\nLook here on the map, this is the checkpoint, from there you walk straight to the territory of the former Rostok factory, there you'll reach the tracks, walk along them to the abandoned construction site. From there turn left, under the railway bridge and straight down the road...\nWell, go on, when you're at Sakharov's - give my regards from an old soldier...</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_0"><text>Greetings! Wouldn't there be any little assignment, comrade colonel?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_11"><text>Don't clown around, Marked One, it doesn't suit you. As for an assignment, well, perhaps there's something for you. Or maybe not for you. Depends on who turns out quicker. By the way, do you know Nimble? I also loaded him with this business.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_12"><text>Don't clown around, Marked One, it doesn't suit you. As for an assignment, well, perhaps there's something for you. Or maybe not for you. Depends on who turns out quicker. See, I'm planning to give this business to other stalkers too.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_21"><text>So what kind of business? I hope it's not delivering secret correspondence to the devil's backyard, for safety, hiding it in... one place? Nimble's a specialist in these matters, I can't compete with him.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_22"><text>I'm all ears. What's the business?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_31"><text>What? Alright, you'll tell me this story later. For now listen to mine.\nWe have one fighter in Duty, Romka Mosya - brilliant sniper. He's on duty at the towers scattered around the perimeter here. I personally saw once how he planted a bullet from three hundred meters straight into a bloodsucker's head while it was fighting with a boar. An unpleasant story happened to him the other day. He had to step away from his post for personal needs. He climbed down from the tower and headed to the nearest bushes, leaving his rifle by the ladder. Did his business, comes back - no rifle. The man was gone five minutes, and the thing was snatched, as if we're not in the Zone but at Odessa's Privoz market. We tried looking, of course, but where...</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_4"><text>Well, thing's lost and lost, so what? I'll never believe you don't have another sniper rifle in storage for your Romka. By the way, what kind of strange nickname is that - Mosya?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_5"><text>We don't have exactly THAT kind of rifle. And about the nickname you could've figured out yourself. We got a Mosin rifle fanatic. Came with his own, though from ancient years, but well-maintained and modernized. The saddest thing is he flatly refuses to fight with other sniper rifles. We offered him SVD, SVU-A, and foreign bolt-actions, but no, he's stubborn as a mule. Says it's all nonsense. Find me a three-line rifle, he says, or I'm writing a resignation report.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_6"><text>I see. So you decided to ask if I have a spare Mosin lying around? Wouldn't it be simpler to bring a brand new one from the mainland? I'm sure there are still plenty lying in long-term storage warehouses.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_7"><text>That takes too long, and I'm not sure they could find one at all. We're supplied according to a certain standard, as you've probably noticed. All weapons and gear are of modern designs... relatively. And for such an "antique," plus urgency, plus smuggled delivery, they'd probably charge a price - good Lord.\nAnd I really don't want to let the guy go. Such natural talents in marksmanship like him are rare.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_8"><text>Makes sense. But how can I help?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_9"><text>I've heard rumors that somewhere here in the Zone, a couple stalkers are wandering around with just the rifles we need. So I wanted to ask you to find one of them and negotiate a trade or buyout. With what? That's up to you. It'll be easier for you to make a deal with your fellow professionals than for any of ours. There are two mandatory conditions: the weapon must be in good technical condition, and include a PU scope in the package. For my part, I guarantee that as compensation for the service rendered to Duty, you can choose to receive either an AK-104 "Tactic" assault rifle or a very rare recipe for modifying the "Film" artifact. What do you say?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_101"><text>Tempting. I'm in.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_102"><text>To be honest, I have a pretty vague idea how to complete such a task, so I'd better refuse right away.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_111"><text>Very good. Try to handle the assigned task quickly, before Romka gets completely angry without his beloved "Moska" and decides to break with our organization.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_start_dialog_112"><text>Then you're dismissed.</text></string>
<string id="tex_petrenko_mosinka_article"><text>Petrenko, Duty's supply officer, suggests finding one of the few Mosin rifle owners in the Zone and trading or buying this weapon from him. For delivering the sniper rifle in good condition, as well as the PU scope that goes with it, I can choose a reward: AK-104 assault rifle or a rare artifact modification recipe.</text></string>

<string id="petrenko_mosinka_done_dialog_0"><text>Remember, you gave me the assignment to find a new Mosin for your sniper?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_done_dialog_1"><text>I remember, of course. Did you manage it, got one?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_done_dialog_21"><text>You bet! Look, here's the rifle, and here's the scope for it. Everything's working, everything functions.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_done_dialog_22"><text>Not yet. It's not such a simple task, as you understand. But I think it'll work out. Just reminding you that I'm still on it.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_done_dialog_23"><text>I'm forced to admit that I failed and give up this assignment. Please understand and forgive.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_done_dialog_31"><text>Let's see... Yes, perfect condition. Well done, Marked One! I remember our deal. What do you want as a reward: assault rifle or recipe?</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_done_dialog_33"><text>No worries, someone else already hustled and got it sorted.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_done_dialog_411"><text>I prefer something tangible. Give me your assault rifle.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_done_dialog_412"><text>I love tinkering with artifact transformations. Hand over the recipe.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_done_dialog_511"><text>One moment... Just don't forget to clean off the gun oil. Thanks for the excellent work.</text></string>
<string id="petrenko_mosinka_done_dialog_512"><text>I'll transfer it to your PDA now. Thanks for the excellent work.</text></string>

<string id="shustriy_mosinka_dialog_0"><text>Hey, Nimble. I want to ask you about something. Petrenko also hired you to look for a three-line rifle for their sniper, right?</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_mosinka_dialog_1"><text>Also? Ah... so you're participating too. Well, yeah, in general. Only, honestly speaking, after all my recent misadventures, I'm not particularly eager to run around the Zone with my tongue hanging out, doing searches with extremely low chances of success.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_mosinka_dialog_2"><text>I understand, I understand. I see you've settled in nicely here. Warm and the flies don't bite, right? Why did you agree to work for the colonel then?</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_mosinka_dialog_3"><text>Well, I had one idea. Thought I could quickly find out everything and dash off for the rifle, but it turned out that it's not so simple, so I spat on it.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_mosinka_dialog_4"><text>Can you tell me? You've basically already given up on the search anyway.</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_mosinka_dialog_5"><text>What else! I mean... I'm in debt to you, Marked One, don't think I forgot, but... Ah, it's no big secret! Basically, I chatted with buddies here and managed to get on the trail of one old man, owner of a Mosin. Some say he's often seen somewhere in the northern part of the Swamps. Others say they saw him at the Forgotten Hamlet. Either Ivanych or Stepanych they call him. That's all I know. You understand yourself, with such a meager lead dragging yourself across half the Zone doesn't seem worth it, so...</text></string>
<string id="shustriy_mosinka_dialog_6"><text>Either Ivanych or Stepanych. I have a feeling I know who we're talking about. Thanks, I'll check out this lead.</text></string>

<string id="dolgman_postmens_dialog_101"><text>Always rummaging, rummaging... Scurrying around all day long.</text></string>
<string id="dolgman_postmens_dialog_102"><text>I heard you guys found some package with letters?</text></string>
<string id="dolgman_postmens_dialog_103"><text>Eh... when? There was a package with papers. And there were letters in there too? I would've read them, otherwise whenever I go to take a leak all I get are some forms... Not anymore.</text></string>
<string id="dolgman_postmens_dialog_104"><text>And where did you get it?</text></string>
<string id="dolgman_postmens_dialog_105"><text>How should I remember?! We were walking past one of the piles, so we picked it up along the way. There was other stuff lying around, various boxes, more packages... only it was radiating hard, so we didn't bother figuring it out, and we couldn't afford to delay - there were tons of dogs there. Maybe bandits wasted some mailman or courier? Good thing you reminded me, we should go rummage there again, maybe something interesting is left... if only I could remember exactly where... I think there was a box lying around, or found it in a pipe... I remember it was near a pile somewhere, a tree, swamp, ravine on the right, and seemed to be toward the Dark Valley...</text></string>
<string id="dolgman_postmens_dialog_106"><text>Oh... one more thing. You don't happen to know if the military has conscripts here? I thought there should only be contract soldiers...</text></string>
<string id="dolgman_postmens_dialog_107"><text>Why are you asking me? Ask the military, if they want to talk to you.</text></string>
<string id="dolgman_postmens_dialog_108"><text>Yeah, they're not talkative with stalkers. We'll see...</text></string>
<string id="dolgman_postmens_dialog_201"><text>You again! How much is enough!</text></string>
<string id="dolgman_postmens_dialog_202"><text>Calm down, I'm leaving.</text></string>

<string id="postmens_text_2">
<text>Bundle of papers. Mostly personal letters and some forms. Only a fragment of one letter catches attention.\n \n"...now there's Captain Sergeev here, so I'm directly under him. He was somewhere with you guys, why was he transferred? So he says he heard at headquarters that you'll be getting serious reinforcements soon. It's both good and bad. Good that there's reinforcement, and bad that it means they might throw us to you too. Damn, how I don't want to sit in this shit... (And Sergeev probably thinks the Zone is over for him. Yeah right, dream on, if there's reinforcement, they'll send him right back as a "specialist". :))</text></string>
<string id="memory"><text>Memory:\nSergeev! And exactly captain! I've heard this surname. We're probably even acquainted... Where is he?</text></string>

<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_0"><text>I've wanted to ask for a long time, just out of curiosity... do you have conscripts serving too?</text></string>
<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_1"><text>Of course... Me, for example. Finally getting discharged! Already, you could say, packed and ready. One last duty and toot-toot! Our folks have been bombarding us with letters, and the mail works like hell knows what. Haven't been able to send anything there or receive anything from there for a long time.</text></string>
<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_21"><text>I happened to see a fragment of a letter, seemed to be to some soldier. They say somewhere a whole package of letters was found. I'll look around, ask questions, if anything, I'll bring it.</text></string>
<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_22"><text>That would be great...</text></string>
<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_3"><text>I happened to find a package with letters at the Garbage, take a look.</text></string>
<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_32"><text>At the Garbage?! Holy crap, that's why our mailman's been gone so long, did he fly into somewhere? Let me see. Wow, a letter for Kolyan, but he's already been discharged... This is for Vitka, he'll dance for me today... So, so... Well, this guy doesn't need it anymore, yeah... Aha, and the guy with glasses got lucky too... so... damn, it's not here... Was there more?</text></string>
<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_33"><text>That's all.</text></string>
<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_34"><text>Well, you made them happy, sorry it wasn't me, but still. What do you want? I got some ammo for the Kalash...</text></string>
<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_4"><text>Give me everything you can.</text></string>
<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_42"><text>Here, just turn around so it's not obvious.</text></string>
<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_43"><text>Conspirator...</text></string>
<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_5"><text>Don't need anything, you better tell me, where does Captain Sergeev command?</text></string>
<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_52"><text>He had a position at the Swamps. Only he was transferred two months ago, you won't find him there.</text></string>
<string id="soldier_postmens_dialog_53"><text>At the Swamps... So I was there after all... That's just me thinking out loud. Thanks.</text></string>

<string id="saharov_postmens_dialog_0"><text>Here, there's a note for you from Docent.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_postmens_dialog_1"><text>From Docent? Who's that?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_postmens_dialog_2"><text>Hmm... I thought you knew. Thought he was one of yours... He's at the bar - brainy guy like that. Always tinkering with something... He wrote you a note, says you'll figure it out.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_postmens_dialog_3"><text>Ah! That one... So he's not a docent, he doesn't have a degree... Alright, thanks. He wants to check some ideas about the Zone. Hmm... Let's see...</text></string>

<string id="scarman_tomb"><text>Unknown stalker. April 2012.\nJust a good man. Sorry, didn't get to ask his name.\nHe had a scar across his whole face.\nIf anyone knew him, come by. Just closer to nighttime.</text></string>
<string id="scarman_tomb_memory"><text>Memory:\nThis guy with the scar... Someone familiar? I saw him somewhere... Or didn't see him, but someone told me about him... Something's there, can't quite grasp it.</text></string>

<string id="red_forest_lesnik_scarman_dialog_0"><text>And who's buried near the house? Some Scar guy...</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_scarman_dialog_1"><text>I don't know. I wasn't here when they buried him. Went to the forest to check traps. What's it to you?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_scarman_dialog_2"><text>Something seemed familiar, but I can't figure out what. I have memory problems. So I'm looking for at least some thread...</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_scarman_dialog_3"><text>Try to find whoever buried him. He appeared here several more times. If I'm not mistaken, then</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_scarman_dialog_4"><text>Alright, thanks. I'll try to find him.</text></string>

<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_0"><text>Haven't you heard, they say there's a tunnel to an underground lab somewhere around here?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_1"><text>Why "heard"? I know. Not long ago two weirdos were heading there. Supposedly there are some special documents there that can help deal with the "Brain Scorcher". Another tall tale, of course, about documents, but the tunnel entrance definitely exists. Long ago, even before the Zone expanded so much, eggheads would come and go from there from time to time.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_2"><text>Come and go? And these weirdos, did they get through too?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_3"><text>No, I don't think so. One, as they said, chickened out completely. And the second one climbed in and... that's it! Gone without a trace. What's got you suddenly interested in the lab?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_4"><text>There's one interest. So where's the entrance?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_5"><text>Well... From here as you exit, there will be gates to the Nature Reserve straight ahead. You'll enter - turn right and along the fence to the entrance to the old excavation. Well, there, look around - you'll find the passage... Only, you won't get through - there's an anomaly there. Seems it can be "turned off" temporarily with an artifact, this ruby one. Well, you probably know about this...</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_61"><text>So you can remove anomalies like that?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_62"><text>Yes, I know, "Carousel" can be shut down with "Ruby Spring".</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_63"><text>Hmm. I know that "Funnel" can be plugged with "Ruby Battery".</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_71"><text>Yeah. Exactly. There are such artifacts that can "collapse" an anomaly temporarily. For how long - who knows! And there's a "Funnel" sitting there. Nasty anomaly. You can't discharge it just like that. But with a "Ruby Battery" you can slip through. If you have one, of course...</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_72"><text>Yeah. Exactly. But there's no "carousel" there, there's a "Funnel" sitting there. Nasty anomaly. You can't discharge it just like that. But with a "Ruby Battery" you can slip through. If you have one, of course...</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_73"><text>Exactly. That's exactly where the "Funnel" sits. Nasty anomaly. You can't discharge it just like that. But with a "Ruby Battery" you can slip through. If you have one, of course...</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_83"><text>Alright, got it. Need to get this "Battery". You don't happen to have one lying around?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_93"><text>You kidding? It's worth a ton... If I had one - would've sold it to traders long ago.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_81"><text>Mmm. You don't happen to know where to find such a "Battery"? Maybe you have one?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_91"><text>Eh... Well I've heard about how you can try to "cook up" such an artifact. And... Maybe I'll even tell you... Not for free though.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_10"><text>Yeah, I get it - for free you can only spoil the air here in the Zone. How much you want?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_111"><text>Keep your cash. I need some ammo. For the shotgun. Bring three hundred shotgun shells - and I'll outline everything I know. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_112"><text>Keep your cash. I need some ammo. For the shotgun. Two hundred buckshot - and I'll outline everything I know. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_113"><text>Keep your cash. I need some ammo. For the shotgun. Don't be stingy with a hundred slugs - and I'll outline everything I know. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_x16_dialog_12"><text>Alright. You'll get your ammo.</text></string>

<string id="red_forest_lesnik_battery_dialog_0"><text>Remind me, what do you need for the way to get a "Ruby Battery"?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_battery_dialog_11"><text>Head doesn't hold anything at all? It happens. I need some ammo. For the shotgun. Bring three hundred shotgun shells - and I'll outline everything I know.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_battery_dialog_12"><text>Head doesn't hold anything at all? It happens. I need some ammo. For the shotgun. Two hundred buckshot - and I'll outline everything I know.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_battery_dialog_13"><text>Head doesn't hold anything at all? It happens. I need some ammo. For the shotgun. Don't be stingy with a hundred slugs - and I'll outline everything I know.</text></string>

<string id="red_forest_lesnik_battery_dialog_23"><text>Aha! Right. Just something made me doubt. Here, take it.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_battery_dialog_24"><text>Just forgot a bit. Alright. I'll find it.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_battery_dialog_3"><text>Yeah, sorry about that. But you understand yourself, it's hard to survive here. Alright, that's all lyrics.\nWrite down the method: if you throw a "Battery" artifact into a "Snow" anomaly, you can get a "Ruby Battery". Transformation time - a bit more than two hours. With this artifact you can eliminate "Electra" and "Funnel" anomalies.</text></string>

<string id="scarman_dialog_101"><text>Hey there, friend. Why so worried? Sit down, rest...</text></string>
<string id="scarman_dialog_102"><text>Don't know anything about a guy with a scar?</text></string>
<string id="scarman_dialog_103"><text>Boy, you're asking... Show me who doesn't have a scar here. Wait... or are you talking about that guy with the scar on his face that we buried once?</text></string>
<string id="scarman_dialog_104"><text>Well, probably... I saw the grave, it says "if anyone knew the guy with the scar on his face, come by". Something like that... Won't you tell me about him, I think I might have known him... or seen him... Generally, I'm confused myself, either I saw him myself, or someone told me about him.</text></string>
<string id="scarman_dialog_105"><text>Actually, it wasn't me who wrote on the cross, but my buddy, he's not here now. He brought him to us... or no, didn't even bring him, but he just appeared suddenly somehow. I was off to the side, didn't really listen to what they were chatting about, wasn't the time for it, we were getting ready for business... But from their friendly exclamations and laughter I understood that the guy was sociable and communicative. And then suddenly shooting, mercs showed up from somewhere... not many, more of ours. Well, in short they scattered, shot it out as usual, they seemed to withdraw. And my buddy got wounded. We didn't have great medicine then, so that guy patched him up a bit with his supplies... Yeah, he practically saved him, you could say.</text></string>
<string id="scarman_dialog_106"><text>And then what? Why suddenly the cross?</text></string>
<string id="scarman_dialog_107"><text>Yeah, it was all stupid somehow... Our own fault, thought everything was over. The mercs withdrew, but at the end someone took a shot from afar with a sniper rifle... They, apparently, weren't even after us, just stumbled upon us by accident. Well, that's how it happened. What made you think he was familiar anyway? Because of the scar?</text></string>
<string id="scarman_dialog_108"><text>Yes. Something seemed to switch on in my head for a second. You see, I have my own... little problem with memory. And here it seemed for a moment that... No! It feels like it wasn't even me who knew him...</text></string>
<string id="scarman_dialog_109"><text>Did it hit you that hard? Yeah, it happens... Go to my buddy, ask him, maybe he'll tell you more.</text></string>
<string id="scarman_dialog_110"><text>If there's a way there, I'll definitely ask.</text></string>
<string id="scarman_dialog_201"><text>How are you? Still looking for traces of Scar?</text></string>

<string id="tomber_scarman_dialog_101"><text>Greetings. What brings you here?</text></string>
<string id="tomber_scarman_dialog_201"><text>Greetings again. Found anything?</text></string>
<string id="tomber_scarman_dialog_202"><text>Nothing interesting.</text></string>
<string id="tomber_scarman_dialog_102"><text>You buried the guy with the scar on his face? I saw the cross with your note. Tell me who he was.</text></string>
<string id="tomber_scarman_dialog_103"><text>What for all of a sudden? I already forgot about him, and actually I wanted to find out more about him myself... I wrote: come by, if anyone knew him.</text></string>
<string id="tomber_scarman_dialog_104"><text>You see, I have a feeling I knew him, even seem to remember his appearance... And at the same time I feel like it's not really mine... How to explain it... Well, it's like I remember, but like I shouldn't remember. If someone would remind me, give me a hint... Nothing left of him?</text></string>
<string id="tomber_scarman_dialog_105"><text>Well how should I put it... just, nonsense. There was a PDA. I didn't sell it, somehow felt bad about it, he basically saved me... and then I lost it anyway... Are you shell-shocked? He was strange too somehow. Guy seemed cheerful and sociable, quickly somehow fit in with us. Immediately common talk about the Bar, about Sidor, about loot... well, you could see he knew what was what and wasn't his first day in the Zone. But he was also looking for someone, but who - couldn't say, or didn't want to... or like you, didn't understand himself what to say. Maybe he was looking for you?</text></string>
<string id="tomber_scarman_dialog_106"><text>That's unlikely... So you can't really say anything either, that's a shame.</text></string>
<string id="tomber_scarman_dialog_107"><text>What can I say now, that was so long ago... I didn't even get to ask his name, thought maybe someone who knew him would write the name on the cross later... Those mercs appeared at the wrong time... Listen! Maybe they were looking for him, huh? You reminded me of them... So they shot for show, spotted him, figured out which one, didn't bother with us, and nailed him from afar... And they aimed precisely, for sure, to get him with one bullet... Damn, why didn't I figure it out right away? Why did they back off from us so quickly...</text></string>
<string id="tomber_scarman_dialog_108"><text>And where's his PDA?</text></string>
<string id="tomber_scarman_dialog_109"><text>I'm telling you, I lost it. I didn't really look at it properly. But if there was such a situation as I'm thinking now, it would've been interesting to dig through that PDA... Wait... So I looked through it briefly there at the grave, put it in the backpack... pockets were full. I remember at the tech dump it was still there, I just took it out to flip through, but quickly shoved it back - dogs came running, you know... then I had to dash to the Hamlet. Aha! And when I came back it was gone. And there was a hole in the backpack, I lost a spare battery then too, and something else... Well yeah! Exactly! Somewhere at the Hamlet... Or no... We also went to the Cordon, chased flesh... Ah! Can't remember anymore! Basically, it's screwed, you'll never find it now, and that's a shame. In short, most likely</text></string>
<string id="tomber_scarman_dialog_110"><text>Yeah, shame. Now you won't find it in the grass, in the mud. Unless by luck it's lying somewhere on clean ground.</text></string>

<string id="personal_things_max_0"><text>I saw your message on the network. I'll need to head to the Cordon soon anyway...</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_max_1"><text>Excellent, you're the first to respond. There's a job here, couldn't be simpler - take personal belongings of one of my fighters to the trader at the Cordon. He was a good fighter, former stalker, by the way. He's been here almost since the Zone was formed, but understood in time who to stick with. Yeah... he was with us for a long time, and now you see how it is... Basically, Skryaga is collecting some of his things, just - small stuff, need to take it to Sidor, he should forward it further, we have an arrangement about this. Skryaga will put together a package, write the address, your main job is to deliver it before Sidorych takes off.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_max_21"><text>I won't mess around with someone else's junk.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_max_31"><text>As you wish. Don't want to - live as you want... just don't forget: as you do, so it's done to you...</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_max_22"><text>Alright, since I'm heading that way anyway.</text></string>

<string id="personal_things_skryaga_0"><text>Max asked me to take someone's things to the Cordon.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_skryaga_11"><text>Yes-yes, right now. He had so few things - practically nothing, a couple photos, notebook with scribbles, this and that, some knife... basically, a little package of stuff... Hey! Marked One, why are you staring at one spot? You here?.. I was talking to you!</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_skryaga_21"><text>Huh? I was thinking... Here we run around the Zone, fuss about something and forget that everyone has... I mean, had some life before, and there are things that remind of it. And there's someone to pass them to. And me? I don't have any personal things. Can't count an assault rifle and torn backpack as personal items. Eh! No photos, no mementos, no memories - nothing...</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_skryaga_12"><text>Where were you wandering? Already delivered without you.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_skryaga_22"><text>Ah... Well, alright then.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_skryaga_23"><text>Maybe need something else? Just ask...</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_skryaga_3"><text>That's what you're about. So here, I'm saying, I wanted to keep this knife for myself, but it's too small, what use is it - can't even cut sausage, though the handle is nicely made... What are you slowing down again, were you getting high yesterday or something?</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_skryaga_4"><text>A knife! I've seen one with such a handle before! That means I should have known the owner. Let me see the photo... Is this him? What was his name, you say? And who's next to him?</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_skryaga_5"><text>This one? His name was Ilyukha Ace. And next to him... yeah, seems like his buddy, who he started as a stalker with. Only he didn't join us. But Ilyukha didn't tell anything about you, and nobody here remembers you. So if you knew him, it was probably back in his "stalker" life. You should go to his buddy, this one here. I think he's somewhere... Ilyukha once said... let me remember... Ah:</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_skryaga_6"><text>Ilyukha... Hmm... Alright, give me the package, I'm off.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_skryaga_7"><text>Here, come by if you need anything...</text></string>

<string id="personal_things_sidor_0"><text>Here are some things from a Freedom guy, they asked me to deliver them, you should know what to do next.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_sidor_2"><text>Things? Were you acquainted?.. Alright, leave it. Fine, don't need an artifact - I'll take money from you. Just 5000.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_sidor_3"><text>What for?! Max-Freedom guy said just to deliver, and you'd handle everything yourself, arrange it all...</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_sidor_4"><text>Well... I thought you found an acquaintance, thought to do it faster for you, more carefully. And speed and care cost money. Who's Max to me? He can wait. But for you I would've tried harder, you understand...</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_sidor_5"><text>What a cheapskate! These are things of a dead stalker. Do you have any conscience?</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_sidor_6"><text>Yeah... You're right, it's not right somehow... Then 3000 - but everything instantly.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_sidor_71"><text>In short, I was told to deliver, I delivered. That's it.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_sidor_81"><text>Well, suit yourself... Let it lie for now, I'll forward it when there's a free opportunity...</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_sidor_72"><text>Here, our conscientious one...</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_sidor_82"><text>Right, who knows... And you won't fill your belly with conscience, you should understand.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_sidor_73"><text>I'll think about it, maybe find someone who values these things.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_sidor_83"><text>Think, think, what do I care...</text></string>

<string id="personal_things_second_dialog_101"><text>Hey. Who are you looking for?</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_second_dialog_102"><text>You. Did you know Ilyukha Ace? He's gone... Max-Freedom guy asked me to take some of his things to the trader to forward them where needed.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_second_dialog_103"><text>Ilyukha?.. Yes, I already know. Just didn't expect Max could ask such a thing. Never even crossed my mind... Seems they became really close. Did you know him too?</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_second_dialog_104"><text>I think so, but can't remember exactly. I saw his knife and it seemed I'd seen such before, which means I met the owner... But I didn't recognize him in the photograph. Well, that photo where you're both together.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_second_dialog_105"><text>Ah! Right, there was that. And the knife was made for him by either his father or grandfather when he was still a child... or bought. Anyway, he treasured it for some reason. And Max probably knew, since he decided to send it with the things. Didn't expect that from him, honest. And thanks to you for fulfilling this request. I hadn't seen you with him before, though we hadn't been in touch for a long time, basically since he went to Freedom. Actually, long time - that's by Zone standards. But basically, none of those he came with are left. Some left, and some like Ilyukha...</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_second_dialog_106"><text>Yeah... And there was hope...</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_second_dialog_107"><text>Wait a minute... There's still our mutual acquaintance. If you're in his area, talk to him...</text></string>
<!-- Expected: Name and Location of an experienced stalker (either explicitly specified or random, as desired). Not this location, but any other. --> 
<string id="personal_things_second_dialog_108"><text>If I'm there... Because I feel he won't say anything either. But who knows...</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_second_dialog_201"><text>Ah! Hey! How's it going?</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_second_dialog_202"><text>It's alright. I guess.</text></string>

<string id="personal_things_third_dialog_101"><text>What are you looking at, stalker?</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_third_dialog_102"><text>You knew Ilyukha Ace, right?</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_third_dialog_103"><text>I did, long time ago though. He went to Freedom, and recently they told me he's gone.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_third_dialog_104"><text>Well... me?.. Don't you recognize me?.. By any chance?..</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_third_dialog_105"><text>No. I don't recognize you. What, should I have?.. Ah! Wait! You're the one who sent his things at Max's request? My buddy just sent me a message... You did good, of course.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_third_dialog_106"><text>I'm not talking about that at all... It's not about the things... What rotten luck! Why is it like this? Just when you start to understand something, the person's already gone and you can't find out anything from him. Just seems like any moment now I'll learn something, that it's right there, already close... and again disappointment. Nothing but disappointments everywhere...</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_third_dialog_107"><text>Exactly! In life generally it's mostly just disappointments. That's how it's arranged. And especially in the Zone. But! Something still makes us happy... My buddy forgot to thank you. So here, I was collecting something for him at his request. He asked me to give it all to you. Take it!</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_third_dialog_108"><text>Thanks.</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_third_dialog_201"><text>How are things, Marked One?</text></string>
<string id="personal_things_third_dialog_202"><text>Well, going slowly somehow.</text></string>

<string id="botans_report_bandit_dialog_0"><text>You still haven't told me about Ghost.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_bandit_dialog_1"><text>Well, listen. This was last week. Or the week before?! Anyway, doesn't matter. Our scout signaled that two were coming with rich loot from somewhere far away. I sent my boys to feel them up, all as usual. They took one right away, turned out to be an egghead. He had practically nothing with him. Just some papers, a bit of grub, and various small stuff.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_bandit_dialog_2"><text>That's clear. And the second? Was that Ghost? Was he escorting the scientist?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_bandit_dialog_3"><text>Yeah, but I didn't know that then. The second one just vanished into thin air. And about half an hour later a seasoned stalker comes rolling up to us here like nothing happened. Silent type, collected, eyes darting around. Yeah, his eyes were unusual - very light. Anyway, when he introduced himself, I immediately remembered what the brotherhood told about him, that he's completely off his rocker... He didn't want to make contact, so I decided not to escalate. Just sent two guys to watch this weirdo.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_bandit_dialog_4"><text>By the way, how did you figure out it was him who was with the egghead?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_bandit_dialog_5"><text>Ghost told us himself. He also added that he understands why we're sitting here, and so we don't come out empty-handed, we can take the papers from the egghead and push them to some guy at the Bar for decent cash. Said and done. And at the end he dropped that we'd better not even try to shake him down. Turns out he bought himself off with the egghead, kinda.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_bandit_dialog_6"><text>Even so? Well, well... And did you manage to track where Ghost went after?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_bandit_dialog_7"><text>Only to the entrance of the valley in the eastern part of the forest. My guys swore that Ghost shook them off his tail, but I suspect they just chickened out following him. There's tons of mutants there. That's all I know. So are we even now?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_bandit_dialog_8"><text>Now we are. Be seeing you, lucky one.</text></string>

<string id="botans_report_lim_trader_dialog_0"><text>I wanted to ask. You sit closer to the center of the Zone, probably good loot gets brought to you often?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_lim_trader_dialog_1"><text>What good loot... Who brings it here? You see yourself, came with an empty bag.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_lim_trader_dialog_2"><text>And a scientist accompanied by a stalker... How to describe him? Seasoned, silent and with very light eyes... Such guys didn't visit you recently?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_lim_trader_dialog_3"><text>I know nothing! What stalker, what scientist... who told you such nonsense? Nobody was here and I saw nobody. And how did you come, through the bridge? Did you visit the boys by the forest?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_lim_trader_dialog_4"><text>I did, why?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_lim_trader_dialog_5"><text>Nothing... wanted to know how the weather is in the forest - maybe mushrooms started growing, should pay a visit.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_lim_trader_dialog_6"><text>Same as everywhere... I'm off.</text></string>

<string id="botans_report_osvedomitel_dialog_0"><text>Do you sometimes get scientific information?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_osvedomitel_dialog_1"><text>Don't remember anything like that. Be more specific about what you need, maybe we can make a deal.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_osvedomitel_dialog_2"><text>More specific: Greedy's guys said they sold you some scientist's notes not long ago.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_osvedomitel_dialog_3"><text>Greedy's? Now I remember something. They're gone already, some egghead came and bought everything.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_osvedomitel_dialog_4"><text>You mean to say you don't make copies for yourself? And who came?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_osvedomitel_dialog_5"><text>I'm saying you ask too many questions, and my answers cost money and I don't have time to just chat with you. Fork over a check for a thousand bucks and you'll get a copy. If that's too much, give me a second level artifact and you'll find out who came.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_osvedomitel_dialog_63"><text>Uh... Too expensive! I'll think about it.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_osvedomitel_dialog_61"><text>Alright, here's an artifact. So who was it?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_osvedomitel_dialog_71"><text>Some egghead was interested</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_osvedomitel_dialog_81"><text>Hmm... should pay him a visit.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_osvedomitel_dialog_62"><text>Here's your check. I'll try to figure it out myself, maybe at least these notes will lead to something.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_osvedomitel_dialog_72"><text>Here's a flash drive, I scanned the papers. But it probably won't help, it's all formulas...</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_osvedomitel_dialog_82"><text>We'll see.</text></string>

<string id="after_botans_report_zub_dialog_0"><text>Remember, you talked about egghead notes?</text></string>
<string id="after_botans_report_zub_dialog_1"><text>Don't remember anything like that. Who knows who I talked to and when. Be more specific about what you need, maybe we can make a deal.</text></string>
<string id="after_botans_report_zub_dialog_2"><text>Well those, Greedy's thugs brought notes. You even talked about an egghead who bought everything from you.</text></string>
<string id="after_botans_report_zub_dialog_3"><text>Ah! So what? Why are you dragging up all kinds of stuff! You might as well tell me about Stirlitz...</text></string>
<string id="after_botans_report_zub_dialog_4"><text>I talked to that egghead. The one you told me about. Only it's dead quiet there. You don't have any copies left?</text></string>
<string id="after_botans_report_zub_dialog_5"><text>You ask too many questions, and my answers cost money and I don't have time to just chat with you. Fork over a check for a thousand bucks and you'll get a copy.</text></string>
<string id="after_botans_report_zub_dialog_63"><text>Uh... Too expensive! I'll think about it.</text></string>
<string id="after_botans_report_zub_dialog_62"><text>Here's a thousand check.</text></string>
<string id="after_botans_report_zub_dialog_72"><text>Here's a flash drive, I scanned the papers. But it probably won't help, it's all formulas...</text></string>
<string id="after_botans_report_zub_dialog_82"><text>Alright, we'll see. I'll try to figure it out, maybe at least these notes will lead to something.</text></string>

<string id="botans_report_ecolog_dialog_101"><text>Did you want something?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_ecolog_dialog_201"><text>Did you want something?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_ecolog_dialog_102"><text>Yes, I was told at the Bar that you bought some notes from Tooth. Are these your notes? I don't actually need them, I just wanted to know about that stalker-guide who went with you from Limansk.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_ecolog_dialog_103"><text>From Limansk? You've obviously mistaken me for Dr. Perelman. We crossed paths with him at Yantar not long ago. He told me about some guide, but not very willingly for some reason, and I didn't dig too deep. He also talked about a robbery, that very important scientific materials were taken from him. I don't know how they ended up with this acquaintance of yours - Tooth, right? - and how Perelman found out about it, but he asked me to buy them back. He gave me for this, probably all the money he had with him. And I was just heading toward the Bar to... I mean, I want to say, to fulfill one assignment from the bosses. Basically, it was on my way, so I decided to help a colleague.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_ecolog_dialog_104"><text>Why didn't he buy back his papers himself, if he knew who had them? And where is this Perelman anyway?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_ecolog_dialog_105"><text>He had to leave urgently. Said it was for new instruments and equipment. Also wanted to resolve some organizational issues along the way. We're not exactly, you know, close friends. Just acquaintances. Met at a couple symposiums, but didn't talk much...</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_ecolog_dialog_106"><text>I see. So the notes weren't that important, if he left without waiting for them?</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_ecolog_dialog_107"><text>What makes you think that? We agreed that I would immediately send the papers along with official correspondence to the address he left me. Dr. Perelman also promised to bring good cognac as thanks... But that's strictly between us! I don't know, though, how soon he'll return now...</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_ecolog_dialog_108"><text>Alright, I'll wait and talk when I get a chance... Or better yet bargain with Tooth some more.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report"><text>Copy of notes taken by Greedy from the scientist.</text></string>
<string id="botans_report_text"><text>Lots of incomprehensible formulas, calculations, diagrams, tables. Seems like readings from some measurements were recorded and analysis of those readings was conducted. Numbers, numbers, numbers... hard to understand anything.\n
There's a draft of a letter. The letter itself was most likely sent by email.\n\n
"To Academician Aleksandrov.\n
Subject: Indirect confirmation.\n\n
	Dear Alexander Nikolayevich.\n
	It seems that you and I were right about the randomness of psi-field surges and their connection with anomalous process activity and the emergence of neoplasms (artifacts). Yes, intensity has a significant influence, as well as the field's directional vector. But, as you rightly noted, the field surges themselves don't have any cyclical character, that is, no periodicity is observed. And now there's confirmation of this. I took various functions as a baseline and noticed no correlation. That is, here we can confidently assert the chaotic nature of surges, there's nothing ordered about them. And this is quite enough to reject the known theory about the presence of some "intelligence". I, like you, am now inclined to think that this is rather an uncontrolled "natural" phenomenon. I deliberately put "natural" in quotes, because the nature of this phenomenon is just not understood. I meant that these are completely spontaneous, random processes, like manifestations of natural forces. So Professor Vasiliev, who put forward the plant hypothesis of the Zone, is possibly also right about something. In any case, now we have indirect but very strong confirmation of the Zone's "non-intelligence".\n
	To avoid being unsubstantiated, I'll send or bring you my measurements and calculations on them. Measurements were taken at different points in the Zone, including places where very, very rarely anyone went. After all, the whole problem was that we judged by measurements made on the outskirts, and never made them close to the center. Now practically the entire area is evenly covered and some conclusions can already be drawn. You'll ask how I got close to the center? This is where the unpleasant part of my letter lies.\n
	The thing is, I had to contact one experienced stalker, Professor Vasiliev introduced us. This stalker agreed to be my guide, but for a very original payment: he needed that experimental sample of the new psi-field meter that you got for Professor Grigorovich's scientific group with such difficulty at my request. Why he needs it, I have no idea, but he said temporarily and promised to return it later. By the way, my guide watched very closely how I made measurements with the device, and also asked me along the way what exactly and how I was doing - a very curious young man. I'm not inclined to think he deceived me, but... basically, he disappeared. And the device with him. And the most unpleasant thing is that I took the meter without Ivan Sergeyevich's permission (after all, he's the materially responsible person, and I, it turns out, committed theft). But look what results we achieved!\n
	I feel very awkward both before you and before Professor Grigorovich. I'm going to fly to you immediately to privately discuss the current situation and the results of my research. I hope you'll help me get another sample of the device in case they suddenly don't return it to me, and then I'll explain myself to Ivan Sergeyevich.\n
	P.S. Since I mentioned Professor Vasiliev here, I remembered one strange case. My employee two or three weeks ago was at the Army Warehouses (that's what one area here is called), I don't remember on what assignment, and that's not the main thing. So, he assured me that he saw Professor Vasiliev there, though in a very strange appearance - his look greatly struck my employee. I assured him it was a mistake, since at exactly that time I was meeting with Vasiliev at Yantar and he was introducing me to that guide with whom I then worked so persistently for a whole week.\n
	Literally yesterday I told Vasiliev about this story, to which the professor assured that he had never been in that area at all. All this is very strange... I'll need to talk to him again when I return.\n
	Dr. Perelman."

Subject: Available information on X-16.\n\n
	I.S.! Our mutual stalker acquaintance nicknamed Ghost surfaced, as usual, from nowhere and reported what he knows - how to get into X-16! And, according to him, it was YOU who gave him documents from which he got this priceless information! I feel like a complete fool... Six months of meaningless trampling around, three graduate students died. And the answer was with you! Just needed to read it. I understand you have somewhat different problems in your swamp, but you knew how much I needed this information... Well, whatever, tomorrow we're going to storm it... I'm even afraid to suppose what might await us there - inside...\n\n

<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_102"><text>What-what?</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_103"><text>That! Freedom is here! And therefore, dude, share some vodka.</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1041"><text>Alright, take what you need.</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1042"><text>I don't have vodka for you, nothing but shakedowns everywhere!</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1051"><text>There you go, now you're "free". And don't sweat it. You understand - burning boredom.</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1052"><text>Yeah right, suit yourself. Move along then, since it's beneath you to respect good people.</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1061"><text>And what's going on here anyway? What do you do?</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1062"><text>Too many "good people", can't satisfy them all... And what's going on here anyway? What do you do?</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1071"><text>Just this and that. Catching naked dudes falling from the sky. Heh-heh.\nDuty guys also showed up. About 10 faces holed up in the hamlet to the right of the road. What they want - hell knows, but we should clearly keep an eye on them. What should we call you, by the way?</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1072"><text>Just this and that. Catching naked dudes falling from the sky. That's it, move along, don't feel like shooting the breeze with you.</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1073"><text>Just this and that. Catching naked dudes falling from the sky. Duty guys were hanging around here recently, so we settled the issue with them. What should we call you, by the way?</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1081"><text>I'm Marked One. Listen, so what about these Duty guys? Are you really at each other's throats? I thought it was just, more in words.</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1082"><text>Oh, how tender we are...</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1083"><text>I'm Marked One. Alright, I'm off, got plenty to do...</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1093"><text>Take care, busy man! And... don't hold a grudge against us for the "inspection". Here, take some ammo, for foreign guns though, but might come in handy.</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_109"><text>Well, how should I put it. With some it's in words, with others at knife point. Won't you do a small favor? Drop by our base and tell the senior, Lukash, about these Duty guys. Such info is better passed personally. I'll signal the post commander to let you through. Say you're from me. And we'll keep an eye on these soup-slurpers meanwhile. Just gotta be quick about it. So, how about it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1091"><text>We'll see, maybe I'll tell him. See ya!</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_1092"><text>Nah, dude, sorry, I'm heading the other way.</text></string>

<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_151"><text>Ah, it's you! What do you want?</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_glavn_start_201"><text>Greetings! How's life?</text></string>

<string id="mil_patrol_1man_start_101"><text>You... Talk to the senior over there.</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_1man_start_102"><text>And what about you? Mute?</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_1man_start_103"><text>Don't mess with me! Or I'll smack you in the ear with the stock! I said - shoot the breeze with the senior.</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_1man_start_104"><text>Yeah right...</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_1man_start_201"><text>You again... What do you want?</text></string>

<string id="mil_patrol_2man_start_101"><text>Hey there, dude! From far away, I bet? Your face doesn't ring a bell...</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_2man_start_102"><text>Shame it doesn't ring a bell, I don't remember who I am either...</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_2man_start_103"><text>Well I'll be! At least you're not naked. Picture this - the other day we're walking with Boryan, and suddenly - bam! A naked dude falls right from the sky! Mumbling and can't string two words together. We dragged him to the base - he's human after all...</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_2man_start_104"><text>The Zone... You never know what you'll hear.</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_2man_start_201"><text>Ha! Hey, dude! How's life?</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_2man_start_202"><text>Alright, I guess... How about you?</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_2man_start_203"><text>Everything's good! They say we'll move toward the center soon! We'll grab artifacts! Everyone will have enough for life...</text></string>

<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_101"><text>Well now. And who do we have here? Coming to us? On business or just to rest - refuel? What should I call you, buddy?</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_102"><text>They call me Marked One, haven't you heard?</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_103"><text>Nope. Should I have? Did you want something or just looking around?</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_104"><text>Yeah, want to chat with people.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_105"><text>We don't let just anyone in. Who knows what's in your head. Then again, need to inspect your belongings for inappropriate things to bring in... You understand?</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1061"><text>What kind of "inappropriate things"?</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1062"><text>My loot is not subject to inspection. See ya.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_107"><text>All kinds of weapons, including bladed. We're safe here and all our own, so visitors turn in their guns for safekeeping. And we charge for peace of mind, but we know moderation, don't worry. The guys work their asses off, protecting this place from all kinds of scum. And here you can take a nap safely, get some grub, and chat with people. So, nicely: fork over a hundred rifle bullets. Not for Kalash, we got plenty of those, for foreign guns.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1081"><text>Hold on, let me figure out my "finances"...</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1082"><text>Hmm... I met some of your guys nearby, they asked me to pass an important message to the base.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1083"><text>NATO ammo? Alright, fill up the cap.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1084"><text>I don't have those bullets! Maybe you'll take money?</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1094"><text>What do we need those for here... Can't even wipe your ass with them.</text></string>
<!-- -->
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_109"><text>Ah! So you "respected" our patrol? Alright, Freedom remembers kindness. Turn in your guns and come through.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1101"><text>No way, I won't trust my gun to anyone.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_1102"><text>Alright, let me see what you got here. Take this...</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_111"><text>Come through, always pleasant to chat with good people.</text></string>

<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_201"><text>Hey there! Coming to us? Same rules as before - turn in your pieces, wipe your feet and fork over a hundred bullets for the needs of "Zone defenders" for Western popguns.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_2021"><text>Don't have that many. Don't use them.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_2031"><text>Then turn your head the other way. Freebies won't work here today. Or maybe you'll find bullets for the old Kalash, about a hundred? You know, 7.62 ones.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_204"><text>Alright, I'll manage without.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_2022"><text>Well here: bullets. Here's the weapon.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_2041"><text>7.62? Alright, here... Take it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_2032"><text>Good man! Don't worry: we're like a pharmacy. What you turn in, you get back. Come through, rest, chat.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_2053"><text>Don't get worked up. Rest, relax, grab a magazine to flip through. Girls in there... Eh...</text></string>

<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_251"><text>Oh, you showed up! Didn't leave anything of yours with us last time, did you?</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_252"><text>Yeah, I came back for my weapon. Got so worn out, forgetting such things... Return it, please, as a brother.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_253"><text>Take back what you turned in and don't screw up like that again. Good thing I'm still nice, but another shift would never return it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_254"><text>Thanks, from the heart.</text></string>

<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_301"><text>What do you want? Can't rest?</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_3021"><text>I'm leaving, give me back my weapon.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_3031"><text>Alright, move along. Take it - what you turned in is ready for pickup. Drop by if anything.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_3022"><text>Yeah, it's tiresome somehow. I'll go talk to people some more.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_3032"><text>Better take a nap: your eyes look wild, and your face isn't great either.</text></string>

<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_501"><text>Ah, it's you, Marked One... Still wandering? Coming to us again or what? If so, turn in your guns just in case. Who knows what might happen when you're tipsy.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_5021"><text>Nah, I'm just saying hello, then moving on.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_5031"><text>Well, greetings! If you have something to tell, drop by.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_5022"><text>Yeah, got business with some of your guys, here's my "arsenal".</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_5032"><text>Uh-huh, let's have it. Come through.</text></string>

<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_601"><text>Ah, it's you Marked One, still wandering... Lukash said not to search you, come anytime.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_dialog_602"><text>Is that so? Well, not bad. Alright, I'm off.</text></string>

<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_101"><text>Hey there, buddy. How's life? Sit down, let's rest.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_102"><text>And good health to you. Relaxing?</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_103"><text>Yeah. Just came back from a trip. Want to feel safe for a bit at least. Turned in the gun - and my head doesn't hurt. Got tired of being on edge all the time.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_104"><text>Do they really make everyone turn in weapons?</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_105"><text>Not really, I think. Saw Diodor here once with a gun. Here you can freely have some vodka and all... And after that business, you know yourself, many people go off their rocker. So Lukash ordered: whoever hasn't earned respect from the local freedom-lovers, we take their guns and knives just in case. And it's better that way, honestly. At least if something happens - you'll get away with a beaten face, not a bullet to the head.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_106"><text>Sounds reasonable. I see you even got a TV with VCR here. Set yourselves up with maximum comfort.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_107"><text>You bet! That's why many love hanging out here. The repertoire is meager though. Just a couple tapes, and those have been watched to death... Well, you get it.\nListen! Couldn't you dash over to Barman, get something new from him for our "cinema"? I heard he regularly orders fresh stuff from outside the perimeter for his joint. Boosts the establishment's attendance, you know.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_108"><text>Haven't you confused me with someone, dear sir? Go dash yourself. Found yourself an errand boy.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_109"><text>Sorry, put it badly. I can't dash over myself no matter how much I want to. I have somewhat... tense, let's say, relations with Duty guys. So, maybe you'll help out? Not for "thanks" of course. I understand. I'll share a solid tip on fat loot.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_1010"><text>Fat, you say? We'll see. If I don't forget, I'll ask Barman.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_1011"><text>Find someone else. Don't have time for nonsense.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_201"><text>Oh! I've been waiting for you. Haven't dropped by Barman yet for a new tape? Sick of rewatching the same thing for the tenth time.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_2021"><text>Here. Don't know what's on it. Barman said - for connoisseurs. By the way, so you could continue satisfying your... aesthetic needs here, I had to give up a good artifact.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_2022"><text>Get off me with your nonsense.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_203"><text>Great! We'll have a premiere showing. Appreciate that you didn't cheap out paying Barman. That guy always jacks up the prices... But I'm sure the loot that's waiting for you will cover all your losses with interest. Listen here.\nI dropped by Cook the other day. You know the barracks by the campfire where he's always "cooking"? So. It was early morning, but Cook was already drunk, crawling out of the storeroom. I look, and he dropped a key from his pocket. I got some grub from the drunk, waited till he started nodding off, and picked up the key. Now it's yours, a gift.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_204"><text>Is this some kind of joke? What do I need a key for, especially one I don't know what it opens? Where's the promised loot?</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_205"><text>In the stash that this key opens. Everyone here knows Cook skims part of the supplies for himself and sells on the side. How else would you tap into the food flow without setting aside something for hard times? It doesn't happen otherwise. If not for Lukash, they would've kicked him out long ago. But Lukash always covers for Cook, don't know why.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_206"><text>And what, you're suggesting I just clean out his stash? And where is it, generally, do you know?</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_207"><text>What's the problem? Main thing is to do it quietly. He can't afford to raise a fuss. Plus with his reputation as a drunk... They wouldn't listen to him anyway. The second question is somewhat harder. Where Cook hides everything - nobody knows. But surely somewhere near his barracks. Most likely right inside. You'll have to figure out how to search.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_208"><text>Well, suppose so. Why didn't you search yourself with such prospects?</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_209"><text>It's simple. Cook may have been wasted, but he remembered I came by that morning, and after that his key went missing. He suspects me, in short. Immediately starts giving suspicious looks when I'm nearby and generally acts unfriendly.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_210"><text>I see. Need to think how to handle this. Maybe it's better to return the key to the owner?! Alright, see ya.</text></string>
<string id="mil_stalker_rest_dialog_301"><text>Resting? Better lie down, you're shaking all over.</text></string>
<string id="tex_mil_stalker_casset_article"><text>Stalker nicknamed Dobriak, who always hangs out at the Freedom base, asks to bring him a videotape with adult show recordings. Barman should have such things. In return, he promised to give a tip on fat loot, according to him.</text></string>

<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_0"><text>I'd like to earn some money. Maybe there's some job?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_1"><text>There's one... You wander the Zone a lot and surely have encountered zombies, right?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_2"><text>Met them, of course, but what about it?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_3"><text>Some people think they're "humans". Even try to cure "poor" zombies, practically puts compresses on them himself, idiot...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_4"><text>Who are we talking about?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_5"><text>I'm talking about Ivar. Used to be a normal guy, worked with scientists, helped us. But then something hit him hard - got into it with the eggheads, with almost all of them, and doesn't want any contact with ours at all. We're not against him personally, it's just that we exterminate these zombies as spawn of the Zone that we're fighting against, and he treats them, you see... Half-baked "Dr. Aibolit". He won't accept the obvious fact that zombies are no longer people! The Zone creates various monsters, and zombies are just one of the known forms.</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_6"><text>And you've already figured everything out about the Zone?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_7"><text>Not about the Zone, about zombies. He once brought us a "cured" one. Said he managed to bring a not-too-zombified Duty soldier back to consciousness. Ours was a fighter, for sure. Went missing at Yantar, Ivar said he met him as a zombie, but not completely yet, well... partially, I guess. Said his memory wasn't great, so we should treat him normally. Didn't leave his side for a second. But after the first emission this "ours" started drooling, rolled his eyes, pulled out his rifle and went to "waste" people... Wounded Ivar himself and two of ours. We put him down right in front of Ivar. Since then he doesn't want to talk to us, though I tried to drill into him that it's a stupid idea - nothing will help. Until the first emission - and that's it... There's only one way to help them - put them to eternal rest. Same as with the psychos he used to try treating, just as useless...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_8"><text>What about psychos? Is Ivar somehow connected to psychiatry? Did he work at some clinic?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_9"><text>He worked somewhere... Tell me, has anyone, ever, well at least one psychiatrist, at least once cured some psycho - once and for all? And they have clinics, all kinds of recommendations, methods, tons of information on all possible media... But no. Only the appearance of treatment, not real treatment. The psycho seems to get better, then bang - back to the old ways. Same with his zombies. Doctors, damn them!</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_10"><text>Eh, I don't know... By the way, about information media. This Ivar - you say he's also from scientists. Treated psychos, probably had access to some files, medical records, maybe kept something on a flash drive...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_11"><text>You're obsessed with this Ivar! Someone else came here asking all about whether Ivar worked at a clinic, if he still has connections, where to find him... That's it! Closed the topic with Ivar! And anyway, I'm talking about something completely different...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_12"><text>Yes, we got distracted somehow, you wanted to tell me about some job.</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_13"><text>The job is exactly about this. I was told that somewhere at Yantar they saw a squad of zombified - former Duty fighters, judging by their uniforms. We had a raid group lose contact there recently. If you encounter them, do a good deed - free them from such terrible existence. I don't want Duty soldiers, even former ones, wandering the Zone in such condition...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_dialog_14"><text>Well, I'll try to find and put these poor souls to rest.</text></string>
<string id="tex_voronin_killzombi_article"><text>General Voronin gave an assignment to find and put to rest at Yantar a group of zombified former Duty faction fighters.</text></string>

<string id="voronin_killzombi_done_dialog_0"><text>About your zombified fighters...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_done_dialog_1"><text>Report.</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_done_dialog_2"><text>What's to report... There's a swamp at Yantar, behind the scientists' camp. There's also a rusting helicopter nearby. Found your... former yours near it.</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_done_dialog_3"><text>Location matches the report...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_done_dialog_4"><text>Anyway, job's done: they rest in peace. And you were saying that Ivar brought one like that to the Bar? I don't understand how it's possible...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_done_dialog_5"><text>Not like that. I told you he looked normal, but the emission immediately returned him to zombie "norm".</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_done_dialog_6"><text>But is such a thing really possible - bringing a zombie back to consciousness?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_done_dialog_7"><text>Don't load yourself with extra questions. That's scientists' business. Let them deal with it, try, I personally don't rack my brains over it. Neither should you. Our job is to cleanse the Zone of its spawn. And zombies are one of them, no doubt about it. So thanks for the work, stalker.</text></string>
<string id="voronin_killzombi_done_dialog_8"><text>Yeah, you're welcome. But it's all strange...</text></string>

<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_0"><text>About Ivar...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_1"><text>What, did you talk to him after all?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_2"><text>Well yeah, sort of talked. He's not quite sane somehow. At first I thought he really was a zombie or drunk.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_3"><text>There you go... I'm telling you, radiation got him. For sure.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_4"><text>Maybe so. That's not the point. He said something strange. That they shouldn't have turned off that "Brain Scorcher". I don't understand this.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_5"><text>Why do you need to understand? Who knows what he's mumbling. Try to figure out now whether he's saying all this in delirium or awake.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_6"><text>No... He speaks poorly, but you can see it's just hard for him to speak. Otherwise he understands me, talked about scientists in Pripyat. And generally, he clearly wants to turn the installation at Radar back on. But if radiation appears again, those who already went north might die.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_7"><text>So go and lead them by the hand if you're so caring. Created a problem out of thin air. Took someone's ravings seriously... What's it to you who went where.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_8"><text>Ravings or not, there's something here. And he keeps saying it's Strelok...</text></string>
<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_9"><text>What about Strelok? Come on, finish.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_10"><text>Just like that, nothing. I don't understand yet myself. I should check something. Make sure, in case Ivar's right.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_11"><text>You've tired me with your Ivar! Instead of wearing out my brain with his ravings, go to that Pripyat, take a walk, what's it cost you.</text></string>
<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_12"><text>And where is it, Pripyat, don't you know?</text></string>
<string id="barmen_save_ivar_dialog_13"><text>I've heard about it, but how to get there - I don't know. Ask Docent. I think he'll tell you.</text></string>

<string id="monolit_instruments_start_101"><text>Hic... Who are you?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_102"><text>Marked One.</text></string>

<string id="monolit_instruments_start_104"><text>You're confusing me, I'm not Nimble.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_105"><text>Wait, let's drink... I ain't confusing nothin'... You're quick at pulling off deals, they told me... Finding all kinds of crap - that's your thing... Come on, what's your name - Soaked, Drenched... Oof, Soviet power is strong!</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_106"><text>Alright, I'm off.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_107"><text>No, wait... Don't you respect me or what?</text></string>

<string id="monolit_instruments_start_1082"><text>Yeah, I respect you, I respect you. Come on, keep talking... What'd you want?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_109"><text>I wanted? Wasn't it you? Oh, right! I got business, right up your alley, finding stuff... bringing... this and that. Anyway, one smart-ass dude... I, he says, I'm a scientist with a name, I'm all so learned. What was his name... Sniper... Shooter... Marksman. That's not it. Something like that spinning around. Ah! Whatever. So... asked to find his suitcase. There, he says, hic... instruments for the monolith gun. Says he left it in the lab... said something else, a number... no, an index...</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_110"><text>Well, well, what was it? X-16? X-18?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_111"><text>Oh! You're the hammer. Gimme five... no... ten. That's what he said - 10. Pour it up!</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_112"><text>Hold off on pouring. What do you mean "ten"?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_113"><text>I'm telling ya: at Yantar the egghead left a suitcase... You don't get it or what?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_114"><text>Not really so far. Who - is he? What was his exact name? Remember! And what's Yantar got to do with it, you were talking about a laboratory? What monolith gun, what are you even talking about?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_115"><text>What am I... or what was he talking about? How should I know? You imagine what a big gun it is if there's a whole suitcase of instruments for it! Well, anyway... come on, Soaked, when you find it, drag everything here, we'll figure it out...</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_116"><text>Alright... get some rest already.</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_201"><text>Hic... Who are you?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_202"><text>Marked One. Go to sleep already.</text></string>

<string id="monolit_instruments_start_302"><text>Hello. I'm Marked One. Remember? Listen, what was that about a scientist with a suitcase of instruments you were talking about?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_303"><text>What?</text></string>
<string id="monolit_instruments_start_304"><text>Well, you asked me to find instruments, remember?</text></string>

Wait a bit, I'll rummage through my stash, maybe I'll find a decent gun for you...\nAh! I didn't introduce myself - Lyokha's my name, nickname's Junkman. I collect all kinds of weapon junk, well not just weapons, don't turn down armor either. A small business like that.

<string id="hos_junkman_dialog_start_1032"><text>A suit, unlikely. What stalkers bring me can't be restored anymore. I told you - junk.</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_dialog_start_104"><text>And what do you need junk for?</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_dialog_start_105"><text>Well... The question's not quite right. And a bit slippery... This worthless junk has quite a high price there, outside the Zone. You just need to know where and to whom... But that's purely personal business, you understand? Generally, I know - where and to whom.</text></string>

<string id="hos_junkman_dialog_start_1092"><text>There's a path to the Garbage. I'll drop a marker in your PDA. There was a "Tarzan rope" there, but now the passage seems to be open.</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_dialog_start_110"><text>Good, I'm off.</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_dialog_start_1111"><text>Hey, wait, Marked One! I promised you a gift...</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_dialog_start_1121"><text>By the way, I advise searching around here in the vicinity. Stalkers still manage to find useful things, can't figure out where they come from though? And also: be careful on the lower floor, don't get too close to the water, it's radiating like crazy there.</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_dialog_start_1112"><text>Found something?</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_dialog_start_1122"><text>I'll keep that in mind, thanks.</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_dialog_start_1113"><text>You bet! Though there's not much iron now, but good weapons can always be found with me. Here, quite a decent gun... if you repair it.</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_dialog_start_116"><text>And what do I need this scrap metal for?</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_dialog_start_117"><text>What are you saying? This is one of the most lethal guns. Takes down any monster with one shot. Well, almost. Yeah, condition's lousy, but take it to craftsmen - they'll fix it and use it to your heart's content.</text></string>

<string id="hos_junkman_dialog_start_201"><text>Greetings, Marked One! What do you have?</text></string>

<string id="hos_junkman_trade_dialog_0"><text>Here, take a look...</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_trade_dialog_1"><text>Well then... Let's figure it out.</text></string>
<!-- ???????? ????? ?????????? ??????? -->
<string id="hos_junkman_strelok_dialog_0"><text>Lyokha, you wouldn't happen to know Strelok? They say there was such a lucky stalker, but there's been no word of him for a long time. I really need to find him...</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_strelok_dialog_1"><text>Strelok... Didn't get to know him, but his partner, Fang, used to visit me often. He was handy, could make candy out of junk, so he sometimes looked for certain parts. Also was a lucky stalker. But... too stingy. Why the sudden interest in Strelok after so much time?</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_strelok_dialog_2"><text>If I'm asking, there's interest. I'm not interrogating you about your business. No offense. Can you tell me anything else useful?</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_strelok_dialog_3"><text>Nothing special... It was long ago, more than six months passed.\nIf you happen to come across Strelok's trail, keep in mind - he had quite an unusual gun. I could throw in some valuable loot for it. Or maybe an expensive artifact. The rifle looks like an ordinary Kalash, but if you look closely, you'll immediately notice it's tricked out. Fang came to me with it once, looking for suitable parts. I first asked him to sell it, but he refused, no way. And then he spilled that the weapon actually wasn't his, but Strelok's. That's probably all I know.</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_strelok_dialog_4"><text>Thanks for that. Tricked out Kalash, you say? I'll remember.</text></string>

<string id="hos_junkman_wpn_strelok_dialog_0"><text>About Strelok's Kalash, remember we talked about it?</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_wpn_strelok_dialog_1"><text>Yeah. What about it?</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_wpn_strelok_dialog_2"><text>One person claims this is it. Recognize it?</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_wpn_strelok_dialog_3"><text>Holy crap! Will you trade it? I'll give you a good artifact. Third level!</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_wpn_strelok_dialog_41"><text>Nope, first I'll see it in action, then we'll see.</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_wpn_strelok_dialog_42"><text>If the artifact's good, then you got it.</text></string>
<string id="hos_junkman_wpn_strelok_dialog_5"><text>Thanks, Marked One!</text></string>

<string id="docent_blowout_dialog_0"><text>Don't know when the emission will be?</text></string>
<string id="docent_blowout_dialog_1"><text>Well... I don't have exact data, but I think information came through from Sakharov that</text></string>

<string id="sidor_blowout_dialog_0"><text>Don't know how much longer until the emission?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_blowout_dialog_11"><text>Vergas stopped by, complained about radiculitis... So,</text></string>
<string id="sidor_blowout_dialog_12"><text>The rats started squeaking strangely somehow... So,</text></string>
<string id="sidor_blowout_dialog_13"><text>Hmm, on the radio scientists seemed to say that</text></string>
<string id="sidor_blowout_dialog_14"><text>The color on my "Kolobok" is strange somehow... Probably,</text></string>
<string id="sidor_blowout_dialog_15"><text>Vergas, as he says, got relief... Heh-heh... So,</text></string>

<string id="saharov_blowout_dialog_0"><text>What do the instruments say - emission soon?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_blowout_dialog_1"><text>Can't say for sure yet, but it seems like,</text></string>

<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_101"><text>Greetings. So I managed to get here. How are you doing?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_102"><text>Alright, generally.</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_1032"><text>Well that's great. Here, take a crab!</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_1033"><text>You helped me big time, and Rat remembers kindness. In the Valley I got a buddy left, they call him Rasp. He needs a neutral person to establish some connections. If you're in the Valley, shoot the breeze with him. He's got something unique, something that could really help in your wandering life. And he knows a lot about all kinds of shady deals they pull in the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_1042"><text>Let's do without displays of "tender feelings", yeah?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_1043"><text>Rasp? Yeah right, yeah right, memorable meeting...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_105"><text>So... you know him then, turns out?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_106"><text>You could say that. Your Rasp mugged me with his buddies. You weren't planning to send me to him on purpose, were you? In cahoots with him, confess? Watch it, I could whisper to the Duty guys who they really sheltered here...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_107"><text>No-no, what are you, bro! I'm not involved, I swear! No setup here, he really is looking for a capable stalker for some work. And for the trouble I'll compensate you a bit... gave away all the artifacts I had, but got 5 anti-rads. How about it, will you take them?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_108"><text>Alright, hand over your anti-rads. So you say there's sense in visiting Rasp again?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_109"><text>You bet! Won't lose out, for sure. Main thing, signal to him that you came from me, not just some random guy...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_110"><text>We'll see, maybe something will work out. See ya, "bro".</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_201"><text>Hey there, pal! How's life?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_bar_start_dialog_202"><text>Pal? Yeah right...</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_101"><text>Greetings, Marked One. From where, to where, why?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_102"><text>Dropped by to chat with Doctor. How are your affairs?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_103"><text>Recovering slowly. In a month or two I'll be able to play football - that's how Doctor jokes. That's why I moved here, because time goes faster in the Thicket. I'll get better, settle some business and follow Mole and Fox to the resorts. Eh... girls, warm sea, tasty food... we'll party.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_104"><text>What about Fox and Mole? Have they left already?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_105"><text>Yeah, we talked and decided we have enough loot. For us, and our children, and our grandchildren, but life is one. They took their share and left. I stayed behind for now. I still have one business - unfinished.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_106"><text>What kind of business? If it's not a secret, of course.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_107"><text>No, not a secret. I really want to learn the mystery of these trucks with dead bodies. About six months ago my good friend disappeared, and then, two months later, they found him on one of those crashed trucks. Face disfigured, even hands seemed not his, but I recognized him. I tried not to think about it, but I can't. I'll keep trying to get to where these trucks come from. And deal with those who do such things to people.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_108"><text>And where do you want to get to? Do you know exactly where they come from?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_109"><text>I don't know for sure, but they come from somewhere in the center. But who launches them from there and why - that's a big question. You heard about teleports?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_110"><text>Something... in general terms.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_111"><text>I've been here for a long time, observed and understood for myself that the Zone is like... an anthill. You stand looking at it from above and can't understand how everything is arranged so cleverly. Seems like they're bustling around senselessly and you can't understand anything, but look closer - there's meaning in everything. Each one performs its role, and knows where to enter, where to exit. And there are many passages and exits. And they didn't think this up themselves. Someone controls this whole organization, structure.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_112"><text>I don't catch the connection... You took quite a sharp turn and drove a truck... into an anthill. And what do teleports have to do with it?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_113"><text>That's what I'm telling you - there are plenty of passages in this Zone, like in that anthill. There are entrances and exits. Such holes in space, sometimes even visible - like translucent bubbles hanging in the air. You've encountered them, probably? Someone even learned to use some passages by trial and error.\nSo here's the thing. I once got carried away to the District Center. And there, in the very center of the city, I spotted one such bubble. Right before my eyes a truck jumped out of it, flew through the whole city and flew into another bubble. That second one dissolved immediately, but the one in the center - remained, but not for long. It also disappeared after a while. That truck didn't decide to drive on its own, someone directed it through one bubble to another, and there, probably, to a third - and God knows where and through how many passages it flew out. Maybe even at Cordon... Most interesting - from where, where's the starting point?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_114"><text>Listen, Redhead, was there a controller nearby by any chance?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_115"><text>There was a controller, but far away. And this isn't a hallucination! In other places there are bubbles too, and they say they've seen trucks...\nAlright, listen, since we're talking about the District Center. I have a small stash left in that District Center. There's a healing artifact there, I really need it, you understand. Could you bring it? There's another excellent artifact lying there and some other small stuff. You can take all of it for yourself, as gratitude, both for this and for previous help.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_116"><text>You're talking about Ivankovsky District Center, right? Tell me where exactly, I'll try.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_1171"><text>About it, yes. But I don't remember the exact place... You see, this city is a very bad place. Especially the central part. Like some energy vampire settled there and pulls strength out of you drop by drop. I spent only a couple of hours there, but got so exhausted that I could barely stand on my feet and was really out of it. That's why I dropped the backpack with part of the loot.\nIt was in the school, somewhere on the second floor. Look there.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_1172"><text>About it, yes. But I don't remember the exact place... You see, this city is a very bad place. Especially the central part. Like some energy vampire settled there and pulls strength out of you drop by drop. I spent only a couple of hours there, but got so exhausted that I could barely stand on my feet and was really out of it. That's why I dropped the backpack with part of the loot.\nBehind the garage boxes there are garbage containers, next to a tree. Look there.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_1173"><text>About it, yes. But I don't remember the exact place... You see, this city is a very bad place. Especially the central part. Like some energy vampire settled there and pulls strength out of you drop by drop. I spent only a couple of hours there, but got so exhausted that I could barely stand on my feet and was really out of it. That's why I dropped the backpack with part of the loot.\nThere are three Khrushchevkas in the northern part. I remember, I stopped to catch my breath near one of them. Downed a couple energy drinks straight away, and then a "Burner", such a bastard, showed up and I had to run. Seems like I threw the backpack onto the canopy of the entrance where I was standing. Or maybe it wasn't an entrance, but the opposite - a descent to the basement.</text></string>

<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, glad to see you.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_2021"><text>And you stay healthy.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_2022"><text>So you're just sitting here?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_203"><text>Yeah... getting treatment. Did you visit the District Center?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_204"><text>I did, damn it... Terrible place, and the creatures...</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_205"><text>What is, is. Did you find what I asked for?</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_2061"><text>I, well... Can't get through to the center there, legs like cotton and fierce hunger.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_2062"><text>Found the stash. Here's your artifact. Barely made it through... Heavy going there, legs like cotton and fierce hunger. Strange city.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_2063"><text>Found the artifact, but I still have it... thought already and not... If anything, I'll bring it quickly.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_2071"><text>Alright, don't worry, I understand everything. Couldn't do it, so you couldn't. Don't take it to heart... I don't really need it anymore anyway, I'm getting better as it is. If you find it, keep everything for yourself. Well, if you already found it, it's yours anyway, by right.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_2072"><text>Thank you, Marked One. With this artifact I'll get back on my feet quickly, well and Doctor will help with his remedies. Write down this recipe, how to get a very rare modificate.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_2073"><text>Thank you, Marked One. Doctor helped a lot with his remedies. I'm feeling much better already. Go up the ladder, there's a box under the roof. There's a supply of medicine there, it's yours. I don't need that much anymore, I'm getting better as it is.</text></string>
<string id="rygyi_aver_dialog_2074"><text>Alright, don't worry. I'm feeling much better already. If you found something, keep everything for yourself. It's yours, by right.</text></string>

<string id="saharov_vasilev_dialog_0"><text>I was at the Army Warehouses, there's one strange person there.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_dialog_1"><text>You know, sometimes it seems to me that it's hard to meet normal people in the Zone, and there are plenty of strange ones here... What struck you about this individual?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_dialog_2"><text>He appeared unusually. They say he fell right out of the air, completely naked. Two-three weeks ago. They say his face was cleanly shaven and generally, he didn't look like a stalker or military.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_dialog_3"><text>Hmm, curious. And what does he say himself?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_dialog_4"><text>He doesn't say anything coherent. Mutters something... I thought I heard: "Ghost, ghost... took the brain... Colleague... Sakharov doesn't answer..." - that's why I got interested.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_dialog_5"><text>Hmm... This can't be! Could it really be... however, I won't make hasty conclusions. How could I get to know this subject closer? At the Army Warehouses, you say? That's where the so-called free anarchists dwell? Pretty far. Maybe you could try to bring this person here?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_dialog_6"><text>But he can't make head or tail of anything! Sits there, shakes his head, mumbles under his breath. Can't carry him on your back, and I don't have transport. This isn't a job for one person. You should assign someone to help.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_dialog_71"><text>Let's do it differently. Our graduate student, Mateyev, will go with you. Escort him to the Bar. From there, to the Army Warehouses, he can go himself. The road there is safe, as far as I know. We need to make sure it's really the prof... the one I'm thinking of. If my guess is confirmed, we'll send transport.</text></string>
<!-- assistant_umer -->
<string id="saharov_vasilev_dialog_72"><text>Unfortunately there are no free people right now. But I'll keep your information in mind and try to solve this problem.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_dialog_81"><text>Vovchik Mateyev?! He's here? And how is he in your opinion?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_dialog_91"><text>He's normal now. He's a strong guy. Yes, he experienced a strong psychological shock, but the stress from what he experienced in the laboratory will quickly fade into the background before the opening prospects of scientific recognition.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_dialog_92"><text>Well then, I'll go chat with an old acquaintance.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_dialog_93"><text>I'll tell him now, he'll come over.</text></string>

<string id="saharov_vasilev_done_dialog_0"><text>At the Army Warehouses they said you took... the strange subject.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_done_dialog_11"><text>What are you talking about? Oh, yes... assistant Mateyev spoke with that person, as much as it was possible, examined him and reported to me. I decided to transfer him to our research center. There are people who can deal with him.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_done_dialog_12"><text>What are you talking about? Oh, yes... assistant Sukharev spoke with that person, as much as it was possible, examined him and reported to me. I decided to transfer him to our research center. There are people who can deal with him.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_done_dialog_2"><text>So is this Vasilyev or who?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_done_dialog_3"><text>Externally, as I was told, he resembles the professor, but his cognitive abilities have suffered significantly. Even if it's confirmed that "physically" it's him, then mentally he currently doesn't differ from those mooing ones that wander around the factory. How severely his brain was affected by radiation exposure, one can only guess.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_done_dialog_4"><text>Shame, I thought I'd manage to talk with him.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_done_dialog_51"><text>That's completely out of the question. A long rehabilitation course will be required, and even then no guarantees. In any case, thank you for taking part in Professor Vasilyev's fate. I'd like to reward you. I'm sending to your PDA a method of obtaining a rare and unusual artifact.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_vasilev_done_dialog_52"><text>That's completely out of the question. A long rehabilitation course will be required, and even then no guarantees. In any case, thank you for taking part in Professor Vasilyev's fate. Accept this small reward.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_0"><text>Professor, I'd like to ask you something about the District Center.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_1"><text>What district center? Where?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_2"><text>Well in the Zone it seems, where else.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_3"><text>Ah... district 85 - Ivankovsky District Center? You mean that one?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_4"><text>Whatever you call it! 85, 86... Am I asking you or are you asking me? Well, probably that's the one.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_5"><text>Calm down, young man, why have you become so jumpy... I just didn't understand, speak more specifically, what interests you.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_6"><text>You'd get jumpy here too... In short, they say there's such a district center, well this one - Ivankovsky, 85. And supposedly there should be some kind of group there... your colleagues. I'd like to talk with them.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_7"><text>You see, I personally didn't send anyone there. We don't conduct activities beyond district 73. Especially in such dangerous places as district 85. That's somewhere beyond the Tesla zone, if I'm not mistaken. I definitely wouldn't send anyone there, even if they begged to go themselves.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_8"><text>So, but what about... I thought you were the head of all the scholarly brotherhood here, well that is the expedition...</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_9"><text>No. I repeat once more: if some group of scientists is working there, it has no relation to us. And why did you get the idea that I manage all field expeditions? We have our own direction, strictly limited by funding framework. But I know that other groups of scientists also operate in the Zone, having their own sources. Many, you know, try to advance their utopian ideas in the Zone at someone else's expense.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_10"><text>So, not yours... And what can you reliably tell about this district 85 in general? The rumors going around are... varied.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_11"><text>Actually, nothing. And don't look at me like that! Remote districts of the Zone currently don't present scientific interest for us, and idle curiosity is somehow not too characteristic of me. You should ask about this in your stalker environment.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_12"><text>If only I knew who to ask. It's not exactly a thoroughfare there. Try to find at least one stalker who's been to the District Center.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_deadsity_dialog_13"><text>Well then engage in searching, and don't distract me anymore with such trivial questions. Is that all?</text></string>

<string id="docent_deadsity_dialog_0"><text>Heard anything about the District Center?</text></string>
<string id="docent_deadsity_dialog_1"><text>The one that's - Ivankovsky District Center?</text></string>
<string id="docent_deadsity_dialog_2"><text>How should I know! District Center and that's it. What is it, how to get there?</text></string>
<string id="docent_deadsity_dialog_3"><text>Somewhere in PDAs I came across mentions... Didn't particularly interest me, but I saved the information on the laptop. If only I could remember which file...</text></string>
<string id="docent_deadsity_dialog_4"><text>Trading has begun, as I understand. How much?</text></string>
<string id="docent_deadsity_dialog_5"><text>Pleasant to deal with understanding people. A second level artifact will be enough. But keep in mind, I can't guarantee reliability, so no complaints later if something's wrong. I need to rummage through archives, give me a couple minutes.</text></string>
<string id="docent_deadsity_dialog_6"><text>Alright, I'll walk around meanwhile.</text></string>

<string id="docent_deadsity_2dialog_0"><text>What about the District Center, found anything?</text></string>
<string id="docent_deadsity_2dialog_1"><text>There's something, yes. And did you bring the artifact, as we agreed?</text></string>
<string id="docent_deadsity_2dialog_21"><text>Of course. Take it, hard worker.</text></string>
<string id="docent_deadsity_2dialog_22"><text>Damn, forgot. Wait up.</text></string>
<string id="docent_deadsity_2dialog_3"><text>Anyway, if you summarize and filter all the stalker nonsense, this area really exists. And the rumors about it are, to put it mildly, strange and contradictory. Supposedly fatigue piles up on a person there and terrible hunger overwhelms. Just like some anomalous zone inside the Zone. Moreover, the closer to its center, the stronger the fatigue presses - you could just lie down and die. Horrible, in short. Reminds of typical stalker tales, right?\nWell that's all lyrics. You wanted to know how to get to the District Center - here you go. It's located north of the Tesla zone, accordingly, that's where the road begins. Let me mark on your PDA... approximately, somewhere here should pass the old asphalt two-lane, follow it and you'll get there.</text></string>
<string id="docent_deadsity_2dialog_4"><text>Hmm... seems like quite a place this District Center. Listen, is there any mention of scientists in those parts in your archives?</text></string>
<string id="docent_deadsity_2dialog_5"><text>No. I mainly get PDAs from stalkers or bandits. You'd better ask at Yantar from Sakharov. They there, supposedly, maintain contact with all the scholarly brotherhood of the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="docent_deadsity_2dialog_6"><text>That's understandable... Alright, thanks for that much.</text></string>

<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_dialog_0"><text>I got my hands on a bandit PDA, will you take a look? It's password protected tight, seems like.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_dialog_1"><text>What's there to look at? Plenty of those punks die with mobiles. Just criminal filth inside.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_dialog_2"><text>There's an opinion that it has recorded secrets of their boss - Borov. Well and, possibly, something else interesting. I'm especially interested in information about the underground laboratory. Supposedly it should be in Dark Valley.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_dialog_3"><text>Well give it here, I'll look. Got curious myself. The service will cost you two zero-level first tier artifacts. In excellent condition that is. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_dialog_41"><text>Yeah, deal. Here's the PDA. When should I come back?</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_dialog_42"><text>Nah. I'll think it over for now. Maybe I'll come back later.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_dialog_5"><text>Come back in about an hour.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_dialog_6"><text>Got it. In an hour, so in an hour.</text></string>

<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_done_dialog_0"><text>Well, how are things with cracking the bandit PDA?</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_done_dialog_1"><text>I, as promised, got into the memory of this minicomputer. And you didn't forget about payment?</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_done_dialog_21"><text>Yeah I remember everything, I remember. Here are the artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_done_dialog_22"><text>Haven't found suitable artifacts yet. But I'll bring them for sure. Later.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_done_dialog_3"><text>Excellent. I had no doubt.\nHere, look. There was a schematic in the PDA. As I understand it, it shows the entrance to the laboratory you were interested in. I'll transfer it to you now. Is this what you needed?</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_krysyka_done_dialog_4"><text>Yeah, thanks. Well, see ya!</text></string>

<string id="docent_pda_warlab_dialog_0"><text>I found a PDA in one laboratory, will you take a look?</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_warlab_dialog_1"><text>Hmm... You can always take a look? Only the rate has gone up now. There's less work, everyone rushed north, but you gotta live. An artifact... third level.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_warlab_dialog_21"><text>Understood. Here's the PDA. When should I come back?</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_warlab_dialog_22"><text>I'll think it over for now. Maybe I'll come back later.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_warlab_dialog_3"><text>Working on one order right now. As soon as I'm free, I'll deal with your PDA. I'll let you know, wait.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_warlab_dialog_4"><text>Clear. Just try not to take too long.</text></string>

<string id="docent_pda_warlab_done_dialog_0"><text>Heard you were asking for me? Well, how are things with the PDA?</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_warlab_done_dialog_1"><text>I, as promised, got into the memory of this minicomputer. And you were supposed to bring me something for this? We agreed on an artifact?</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_warlab_done_dialog_21"><text>Yeah I remember. Here's the artifact.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_warlab_done_dialog_22"><text>Slipped my mind. I'll bring it.</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_warlab_done_dialog_3"><text>I had no doubt.\nManaged to decipher something! There's a lot of scientific chatter and other personal stuff. But here's what might be interesting for you - there's a stash, by description a rich one, in Red Forest. So if you happen to visit there, look for it. And also... It turns out strangely somehow. Seems to me that different people made entries in the PDA. And about this stash, it's like an addition, doesn't fit the general style, doesn't match. Didn't even have to decipher it much. But there's no author's signature. Only P.S: "left part of the equipment... this should be useful to him".</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_warlab_done_dialog_4"><text>Red Forest isn't a couple bushes, it's big. Where exactly?</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_warlab_done_dialog_5"><text>Somewhere in the northern part. It's written that it's hidden in a tank. As far as I know, by rumors and gossip, there's only one tank there. You won't miss it...</text></string>
<string id="docent_pda_warlab_done_dialog_6"><text>Alright, maybe I'll check it out, if the occasion arises. Yeah interesting, how did a nerd get such information in his PDA. And for whom?</text></string>

<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_start_dialog_0"><text>Listen, Docent, I got my hands on one curious radio. Someone sends messages to it with some telecode. Encrypted, I think. Can you tinker with it?</text></string>
<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_start_dialog_1"><text>Telecode? Who the hell thought of that? Let me have it for a minute... Yes, there's one received message in memory and - you're right - it's encrypted.</text></string>
<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_start_dialog_2"><text>Aha! Will you work on it? I'll pay you back, of course.</text></string>
<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_start_dialog_3"><text>Yeah no problem. Only the payment this time will need to be special. In my free time I'm working on one... project. Right now I have a block due to lack of some spare parts. Ordering them from outside the perimeter will cost crazy money, but I found a reasonable alternative. Local science extensively uses universal anomaly detectors. By disassembling a couple of those, I'll get the missing parts. As I know, at Yantar Sakharov readily trades detectors to stalkers. Are we agreed?</text></string>
<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_start_dialog_41"><text>Uh... You know, it's not that important for me to know what's in the message. Two detectors he wants...</text></string>
<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_start_dialog_42"><text>Two universal anomaly detectors. Deal. Here's the radio. How much time will you need?</text></string>
<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_start_dialog_5"><text>Can't say for sure. I think, about six hours. I'll let you know when I'm done.</text></string>
<string id="tex_docent_radio_pay_article"><text>\nFor decrypting the message from Bold's radio, Docent asks to bring him two universal anomaly detectors.</text></string>

<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_done_dialog_0"><text>Well, how goes it, Docent? Got something to cheer me up? About the radio, if you didn't get it.</text></string>
<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_done_dialog_11"><text>No news yet. I told you I'd let you know. That's it, don't bother me.</text></string>
<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_done_dialog_12"><text>What do you think? I didn't send you a message for nothing. Did you bring what I asked for?</text></string>
<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_done_dialog_21"><text>What do you think? Otherwise I wouldn't have come. Take your gadgets. So?</text></string>
<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_done_dialog_22"><text>Damn it! Got completely worn out, totally slipped my mind... Everything will be ready soon.</text></string>
<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_done_dialog_3"><text>The message turned out to be extremely short. These are coordinates of a district in digital format. Let me mark on your PDA where this is... Done.\nYes, if you don't mind, I'll keep the radio for myself, it'll also come in handy for parts.</text></string>
<string id="docent_borzyi_radio_done_dialog_4"><text>Hmm... Coordinates in Red Forest. I think I can guess what I'll find there. And you can take the radio, I don't need it. Farewell.</text></string>

<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_0"><text>But what about Fang? He was supposed to be taken out of the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_1"><text>Fang... This is very complicated. You see, it's not quite Fang...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_2"><text>Not quite? I don't understand something...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_3"><text>Not surprising. Nobody can understand. I'll describe the facts to you, and the conclusions... You can draw conclusions yourself. When what we call the stalker nicknamed Fang was taken to one of the hospitals in Kiev, some... Um... Incidents began... Something like that...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_4"><text>What kind of incidents? Please, don't drag it out, I need to know! This person is one of the keys to the lock of my memory...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_5"><text>All kinds... Electronic equipment was failing. Electric current was disappearing. Gravity was changing chaotically. It seemed like the laws of our world stopped working. Certainly, it was interesting from a scientific point of view, but this creature... It became unstable. That is, the longer it stayed there, the less time someone could see it...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_6"><text>And then what?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_7"><text>It was decided to return it to "natural" conditions. Here, to the Zone. But here it went into a rage and now we have to constantly keep it under the influence of tranquilizers and hope for a miracle that will allow us to understand what surprise this Zone has given us...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_71"><text>This is all somehow... unclear. Are you sure he was taken away? I never went to the surface, as you ordered. Was there a helicopter or not?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_72"><text>You don't believe me, my dear fellow? And I just wanted to thank you. I wanted to give you a suit.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_73"><text>What did I do to deserve such honors?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_74"><text>For your diligence. You've done so much for us already, conducted so many experiments, and in such places where not everyone would risk going. Provided many artifacts and other materials for study. This cannot go unappreciated. Accept it and remember - you earned this not in vain.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_8"><text>Well... I don't even know... Thank you. Well okay, but what about Fang? Why don't you undress him? Even if you don't consider him human, there are still some moral norms.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_9"><text>What moral norms, for what's lying there? Oh yes, I didn't explain. It turns out that what he's wearing is one with the flesh. There's no person in clothes, there's a creature that looks like a person in clothes. Maybe it considers itself human, but it's not human. The metamorphoses are very surprising: heavy radioactive elements don't settle on this creature's surface, but penetrate inside and are somehow "dumped" somewhere. It's completely "clean" in radiation terms... Practically doesn't need food.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_10"><text>Can you talk to him? I did talk to him there, in the underground. And he didn't seem strange to me... Well, considering what happened to him, of course.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_klyk_dialog_11"><text>I'm afraid that much has changed in him since then. So... there is no Fang, there's something that looks like Fang, accept this as a given. I'm very sorry. But don't despair, every day the Zone presents us with another riddle. And sometimes a solution. We'll try to research, study, look for ways... Maybe we'll get lucky... Or you will.</text></string>

<string id="vergas_charge_pda_0"><text>I need to charge my PDA.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_12"><text>Well go ahead, what are you waiting for?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_13"><text>The guys in the village have a fuel shortage right now, they're told to save electricity. You should bring them a canister of gasoline, Marked One, eh? Or we'll have to wait until others deign...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_14"><text>Charger's busy for now, come back later.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_221"><text>Here, take this one.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_222"><text>Made a mistake...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_23"><text>What bad luck... Alright, let's see.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_24"><text>No problem, I'll wait.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_3"><text>Yeah, indeed the charge is at zero. Come back in about half an hour. Prepare four hundred rubles for charging.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_4"><text>In half an hour? Good.</text></string>

<string id="vergas_charge_pda_end_0"><text>Well, what about my PDA? Is it charged?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_end_11"><text>Huh? Sorry, got lost in thought. Your PDA isn't charged yet.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_end_12"><text>One moment... Yes. It's charged. Do you have four hundred rubles?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_end_21"><text>Alright, I'll wait...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_end_221"><text>Yes, of course. Here, take it.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_end_222"><text>But I forgot about the money... I'll bring it later.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_charge_pda_end_3"><text>Take it. If you need to charge something else - bring it over.</text></string>

<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_0"><text>I'd like to charge my PDA.</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_11"><text>Give it here.</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_12"><text>Sorry, can't do it now. Generator was switched to economy mode, only enough for lighting and the Bar's needs. Nobody's brought gasoline in a while... If only you'd take on bringing a canister, otherwise it's unknown how long we'll have to wait.</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_13"><text>Charger's busy now, come back later.</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_211"><text>Here, take this one.</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_212"><text>Uh... seems like I took the wrong one with me.</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_22"><text>Well, what can you do...</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_23"><text>Alright, it's not urgent for me anyway.</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_3"><text>Is it really discharged? Maybe it's just broken? Though I see the light is blinking. Alright, come back in about half an hour. Seven hundred rubles it'll be.</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_4"><text>Deal.</text></string>

<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_end_0"><text>How's it going with my PDA? Is it charged?</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_end_11"><text>Has half an hour passed already? No. Why did you come then?</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_end_12"><text>Yeah. Seven hundred kilobucks from you, I remind you.</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_end_21"><text>Well, sorry. Why did you get so worked up?</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_end_221"><text>Kilobucks? Let me pay in rubles instead.</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_end_222"><text>Here's the thing... I spent a bit too much. I'll pay you back somehow later.</text></string>
<string id="lisaped_charge_pda_end_3"><text>Rubles, so rubles. Here's your handheld.</text></string>

<string id="saharov_charge_pda_0"><text>Can I charge my PDA with you?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_charge_pda_11"><text>Let me look at the connector. Yes, no problem.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_charge_pda_12"><text>You, Marked One, come in the evening, or even better - at night. During the day the load on the network is heavy, and the professor constantly grumbles about it.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_charge_pda_13"><text>Can't do it now. No free charger.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_charge_pda_211"><text>Then take it. How can I thank you?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_charge_pda_212"><text>Stop! I got confused, I don't need to charge anything.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_charge_pda_22"><text>Hmm... if that's the case, then I'll drop by after sunset.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_charge_pda_23"><text>Got it. So, another time then.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_charge_pda_3"><text>Oh come on. I'm not cranking a dynamo machine by hand here to charge for it. You'll pick it up in about thirty minutes.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_charge_pda_4"><text>Really? Thanks. Small thing, but nice.</text></string>

<string id="saharov_charge_pda_end_0"><text>Can you check if my PDA is charged?</text></string>
<string id="saharov_charge_pda_end_11"><text>One moment... Not yet.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_charge_pda_end_12"><text>Just took it out of the charger. Here's your device.</text></string>
<string id="saharov_charge_pda_end_21"><text>Alright, I'll take a walk meanwhile...</text></string>
<string id="saharov_charge_pda_end_22"><text>Thank you.</text></string>

<string id="shurup_charge_pda_0"><text>I'd like to charge my PDA.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_11"><text>Show me what you got there.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_12"><text>Nothing doing. All chargers are occupied.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_211"><text>What's there to look at? Regular PDA. Here.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_212"><text>Wait, where's the one I prepared?! Sorry, seems like I made a mistake...</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_22"><text>Bad luck! I'll come back later.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_3"><text>You never know. Some guy brought one here too, and his connector was all clogged with some crap. Had to clean it. With alcohol, by the way.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_4"><text>Got the hint. A bottle's on me.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_51"><text>Now that's completely different! Come back in about thirty minutes then.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_52"><text>Ah come on, Cook asked for you, so you don't need anything. Just come back in about thirty minutes.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_6"><text>Agreed. Just wait for me. Don't get the urge to go "clean" something else.</text></string>

<string id="shurup_charge_pda_end_0"><text>How are you doing, in good shape? And my PDA?</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_end_11"><text>What? Oh! No. Not charged yet.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_end_12"><text>Yup. It's charged, waiting for you. And I'm waiting for something too.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_end_13"><text>Yup. It's charged, waiting for you. Take it. Don't need anything else charged? No? Suit yourself.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_end_21"><text>Alright, I'll wait...</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_end_221"><text>Yes, I remember. Here it is, the precious one.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_end_222"><text>Damn... slipped my mind. Wait, I'll be quick.</text></string>
<string id="shurup_charge_pda_end_3"><text>Thanks! Your PDA. Don't need anything else charged? No? Suit yourself.</text></string>

<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1021"><text>Who is this - He?</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1031"><text>H-h-h-osan-n-a-a... P-p-p-e-e-e-ace-e...</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1041"><text>W-w-w-w-well... Yeah right.</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1022"><text>What's this about?</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1032"><text>G-g-g-g-go away-y-y-y...</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1042"><text>Already, what's going on...</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1023"><text>What? What's shining there?</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1033"><text>He! He! Everywhere! Knows! A-a-a-a!</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1043"><text>Alright, calm down. I already understood everything...</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1024"><text>Goes away? Who?</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1034"><text>Light... Light... Light...</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1044"><text>Did it get dark in your eyes or something?</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1025"><text>Protection? What? Didn't understand anything.</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1035"><text>Come-e-e-e...</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1045"><text>Something wrong with the head, apparently...</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1026"><text>What do you want?</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1036"><text>Fear... Darkness... Horror!</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_members_start_1046"><text>Terrible business... Indeed.</text></string>

<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1011"><text>We see you... we see all of you at once, anywhere in the universe... He helps us see...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1021"><text>I see you too... And who is he?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1031"><text>All are united with Him...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1041"><text>Mmm...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1012"><text>He feels your presence... He's ready to open the path through us...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1022"><text>Who are you talking about? Path to where?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1032"><text>All paths are open...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1042"><text>Come on...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1013"><text>With us is strength and light! It opens the path to past and future...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1023"><text>A time machine or something?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1033"><text>Light, light... Look, look, look...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1043"><text>Everything's clear with you...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1014"><text>We are here, we are everywhere... We are at any point. He helps us with this...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1024"><text>How's that? What do you mean everywhere?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1034"><text>He helps, He won't leave us... And there will be eternity!</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1044"><text>Well if you don't want to talk, fine...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1015"><text>Enter me... enter my mind and move with me...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1025"><text>I'm not like that... And where are you calling me, where will we move?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1035"><text>We are in eternity... Darkness, and light, and mind, and crystal...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1045"><text>Didn't understand anything... What crystal?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1016"><text>I opened my mind... you can go... The path is free, He will guide you through time...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1026"><text>I'm already going... Where will he guide me, you say?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1036"><text>Path, the path is free... Go! Go! And... Desire...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1046"><text>Alright, I'm leaving already...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1017"><text>Light illuminates us... His light... Light lights our way... We have no barriers when He is with us...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1027"><text>Mmm... And whose light is it?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1037"><text>He is always with us... Light. Thought is primary...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1047"><text>Well, during the day yes... Or are you not talking about that? Ah, whatever...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1018"><text>Our consciousness is open... It is free in flight, He transfers it... to any point in the universe...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1028"><text>Really to any point?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1038"><text>Everything is one... Substances...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1048"><text>I see... That nothing is clear.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1019"><text>We are one... He and We... We abide in eternity with Him, time is subject to us, thanks to Him...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1029"><text>Uh-huh. And who is this We and who is this He?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1039"><text>Before us is eternity...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_1049"><text>Well yes... why would you hurry when eternity is ahead.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10110"><text>He waits for you... Come and merge into His space... And abide in eternity...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10210"><text>He won't wait... Where, by the way, should I come to merge?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10310"><text>All paths are free...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10410"><text>Well no, so no...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10111"><text>He sees us... He is everywhere... He occupies all space, and We are in Him.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10211"><text>Calm down... We're all in the same space anyway.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10311"><text>He is not here...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10411"><text>What's that about? Hmm...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10112"><text>I immerse myself in him... He moves my consciousness. Space and time are subject to Him...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10212"><text>Well come on, move me somewhere away from here too...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10312"><text>Consciousness... Not all there... Here is the world.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10412"><text>What? Yeah right...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10113"><text>We are one consciousness... We merge with Him in a single flow... The flow carries us through time...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10213"><text>A flow, you say... And where will it carry us in the end?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10313"><text>All in a single point of the universe...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10413"><text>Uh... Well yes, I thought so...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10114"><text>We perceive you... He helps see, wherever you may be... And whenever you may be...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10214"><text>Well perceive away... Can you perceive my past?</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10314"><text>Everything was, everything will be...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10414"><text>And what was? Yeah right...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10115"><text>Me? You! No one else will see... To me!</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10215"><text>Won't see? What won't they see? Come on, speak properly...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10315"><text>Everything was, everything will be...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10415"><text>Something wrong with the head, apparently...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10116"><text>Be born anew... Live forever... And be everywhere...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10216"><text>Forever? And as what? Share the recipe...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10316"><text>Everything was, everything will be...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10416"><text>Will be, will be... Kebab out of you will be.</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10117"><text>Blackness there, darkness here... Little understanding...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10217"><text>How can we understand you?! Darkness, blackness...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10317"><text>You will come and behold! Radiance...</text></string>
<string id="monolith_members_start_dialog_10417"><text>Already. I behold. Stupidity...</text></string>

<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_101"><text>You. Came. Long time. Marked with sign?</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_102"><text>Sign? Mark on the hand or what? Here.</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_103"><text>Yes... Too long.</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_104"><text>What's too long? Were you specifically waiting for me or something? I actually don't even remember where this tattoo came from, thought I'd find out from you. Someone thinks you should know about this and that we could talk...</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_105"><text>Waited. You weren't there. One like you. You people talk much. Ask much. Empty. Say main thing...</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_106"><text>I don't get it... We're people, so what are you then?</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_107"><text>Mind. Thought. All existence. Highest stage of development.</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_108"><text>Really? And those over there mumbling nonsense, they're also the highest stage? Something's hard to believe...</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_109"><text>You don't understand. Common mind. Talk not needed. Not for all. Talk with me. Don't get distracted.</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_110"><text>Well alright... So who were you waiting for? It's unclear. And why?</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_111"><text>One like you. You need to go further. Installation interferes with you. Interferes with us. You can pass.</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_112"><text>Where? And why is it only I can pass, others probably can too if they try...</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_113"><text>No. Blockade. You can. Those like you.</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_114"><text>Hard to talk with you... Well alright, I need to go further, and why do you need the Brain Scorcher turned off?</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_115"><text>Won't let leave. Interferes with thinking. Need to talk. Hard to understand.</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_116"><text>Exactly, very hard. You definitely forgot how to talk... And what does "those like me" mean?</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_117"><text>With blockade. Can get to needed place. Help us. We cannot.</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_118"><text>Get where?</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_119"><text>O-o-o... Not now. Now need to turn off. Will make sense to continue. All...</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_120"><text>Continue what? Conversation? With you? How will I find you later?</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_121"><text>Not me. Anyone. Many questions. Later. Do your business.</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_122"><text>Business... If only I knew what kind of business...</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_201"><text>Go. Act!</text></string>
<string id="rad_tramplin_glavn_start_202"><text>Already am.</text></string>

<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_101"><text>Uh? Who are you? Can't figure it out somehow.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_102"><text>They call me Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_103"><text>Marked One? Nah, haven't heard... I think.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_104"><text>I'm new here. Walking around, looking around.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_105"><text>What's there to walk around for? Our people are sociable. At any campfire they'll be glad... if you got something to pour in a glass.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_106"><text>And who are you yourself?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_107"><text>I'm Slavik, the local cook! Master of knife and spices! Parsley there, dill, all kinds of greens... well, grass, basically. Bread too. And sometimes there's canned stuff... condensed milk, stew. Sausage! Game...</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_108"><text>Alright-alright, I get it! Cook, then. I'll drop by again.</text></string>

<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, will you do a good deed?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_2021"><text>No time right now.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_2022"><text>Depends what kind of deed.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_2031"><text>Well see for yourself.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_2032"><text>It's nothing! There's this dummy sitting not far from here on a swamp. A bit touched, but we don't hurt him, on the contrary even - we feed him. Even though he's not all there, he reliably shoots monsters. Go to him, bring some grub. I'll throw you some food for it too.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_2041"><text>Your dummy, you take it to him. And I don't need food.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_2042"><text>Since it's nearby, I'll go.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_2051"><text>Look at us, what we are... I'll get better and go myself.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_2052"><text>That's good, take this. Just keep in mind: there are mines and radiation there, so be careful, go along the edge of the swamp.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_206"><text>Just knew it was a setup. Eh...</text></string>

<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_251"><text>Oh, what's your name, Marked One... Everything alright?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_252"><text>Your guy definitely doesn't have all his marbles. Barely convinced him to take the food.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_253"><text>That's true, there's a bit. Though, you know, even though he's a dummy, sometimes he'll say something and you sit and think, whether it's chance or he has some kind of gift of prophecy... It happens with fools, I once read in a scientific journal.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_254"><text>So what did he predict?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_255"><text>Not that he actually predicted... A truck appeared here recently, maybe you heard? So he was blabbing about a truck coming long before that happened.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_256"><text>That's all nonsense... If you write down everything every fool blabbers, you'll go off the rails yourself. You didn't forget about the grub, did you?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_257"><text>Ah! Of course, here.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_301"><text>Bro, hello. How are you? And I haven't slept a wink.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_401"><text>Hic... What, can't you see - I'm feeling bad?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_402"><text>Got wasted again?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_start_dialog_403"><text>So what?! Ah! You still won't understand... Some scumbag shot our touched guy...</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="mil_cook_drink_dialog_0"><text>It's boring somehow. Maybe, you know... five drops each?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_drink_dialog_1"><text>I won't refuse if you're treating. And why five drops? If we're drinking, let's drink!</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_drink_dialog_2"><text>Then... Come on, let's have one.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_drink_dialog_3"><text>Ah, went down good!</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_drink_dialog_4"><text>What, another shot?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_drink_dialog_5"><text>Yeah... So it doesn't swerve to the side!</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_drink_dialog_6"><text>Let's go!</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_drink_dialog_7"><text>Heh-heh... you're slick at this! B-boom - and a new bottle. You got a warehouse there or what?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_drink_dialog_8"><text>Got a supply, one more?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_drink_dialog_9"><text>You asking! Well, so it's not the last time!\nA-ah, we're sitting good!</text></string>

<string id="mil_cook_key_dialog_0"><text>I found some key here... was lying by the entrance. You didn't lose it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_key_dialog_1"><text>Let me see... Holy smokes! That's mine alright. Been searching all over, looked everywhere here it seems and still missed it somehow.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_key_dialog_2"><text>Nothing surprising. With your... lifestyle. Don't lose it again.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_key_dialog_3"><text>What do you mean me?! I just... Thanks, bro. Really helped me out. And I got nothing to give you... You know, I can ask Screw, our mechanic, to charge your electronics for free... Well, PDAs there, batteries, something else if needed. I think he won't refuse.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_key_dialog_4"><text>Kindred spirits with him? I get it. And actually, that would be nice. Thanks.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="mil_cook_task_dialog_0"><text>Here's what I want to ask: you wouldn't know, didn't some guy show up here with a distinctive metal briefcase?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_task_dialog_1"><text>What are you getting at, man? That I should... that to you... go and spill all the details? Who do you take me for?!</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_task_dialog_2"><text>Calm down, calm down. I didn't know it was that serious.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_task_dialog_3"><text>Ah drop it! I'm just... we've only been drinking together on broth... brude... damn you... shaft! In short, be more careful with such questions, got it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_task_dialog_4"><text>Deal, just between you and me. So do you know or not? I really need this guy... Just give me a hint.</text></string>
<string id="mil_cook_task_dialog_5"><text>Well... he was supposed to meet with our guys in the village. That's left from the bus stop, along the dirt road. But where you'll look for him there - no idea.</text></string>

<string id="psih_dialog_start_101"><text>Ah!? Who are you?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_1021"><text>Easy... Just passing by. Already leaving.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_1022"><text>Brought you food. Here, take it, I'm in a hurry.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_103"><text>Brought... Food... Yes... Eh!? You have the sign! So it's you!?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_104"><text>Well a sign's a sign. Don't look at it.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_105"><text>Higher people... they're waiting for you... there... beyond the Barrier.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_106"><text>Alright, alright, don't strain yourself... I understand you, everything's fine: higher people, green little men on a saucer, we'll all be there in the end... You better put the food away somewhere.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_107"><text>No, wait! They're looking for you. I heard through the stone... stone fragment. Don't shoot them, they're waiting, want to talk only with you, don't want to with me, I lost the stone...</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_108"><text>Listen, man. I understood everything... Don't get too upset, it's bad for you. There's nobody beyond the Barrier, well except zombies and Monolith guys probably.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_109"><text>That's it! They're waiting for you! Go to them... But I can't anymore, they won't accept me... And you come, come again, I'll tell you, tell you a secret!</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_110"><text>Ugh! You tired me out. Alright, I'm leaving now, I'll talk to them, just sit quietly until I get further away. Don't grab your gun for now, okay?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_111"><text>Yes, I'm waiting for you, later. I have a secret...</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_112"><text>That's it? Well I'm gone.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_201"><text>Ah!? You again?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_2021"><text>Easy... Just passing by. Already leaving.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_2022"><text>I... You didn't forget me, that's good. So what were you saying about a secret?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_203"><text>Did you talk to the higher people?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_204"><text>I talked, I talked... What's the secret?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_205"><text>"Scorcher" - barrier...</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_206"><text>Well I get it. Beyond the Barrier is the "Scorcher". I know that. You concentrate... Remember about the secret? Come on, better tell me about that.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_207"><text>I'm talking about the secret. "Scorcher" - it's a barrier for the higher people. Need to turn off - they'll come here and make us all the higher race...</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_208"><text>That's it? Make us the higher race, you say. And if I have Jewish roots, then probably I won't get it... And how did you learn about the sign, about the Monolith guys?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_209"><text>Stone spoke... In my head. But I lost it, now I don't hear, everything just buzzes... Bad! I want to go there and can't, they won't let me!</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_210"><text>I thought you'd say something about a real secret.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_211"><text>Yes... real. Everyone wants... I already told them. They threatened.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_212"><text>Who are "they"? Also marked ones?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_213"><text>No. Others. Wanted secret. Different... I told them about forest, but didn't give key...</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_214"><text>So there's another secret? About the key?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_215"><text>Huh? I need to go there, to them. How will I go? Man said he'd give their clothes, then they'll accept me as one of theirs. Even without stone. But gave different ones. I threw them away, don't need such...</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_216"><text>Yeah... not easy for you to concentrate. You strain yourself, well that is, don't strain... well in short, relax. Damn! You confused me. What clothes?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_217"><text>Bad... there's much better than what I threw away... In them they'll definitely accept me, hid them well, in forest... and I have key... He said, a man will come, look at me, and will heal. And I'll give him the key. But he has no time to wait... But I'm not sick, no need to heal. I lost stone. I need stone.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_218"><text>Yeah what's there to heal about you, really. You're yelling that you already have a certificate... Alright, you confused me completely. I'm going. You don't have any key.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_219"><text>I do. I didn't give it to them. I'll give it to you. You were with them, you're allowed. Here. Everything's in forest, underground, open there...</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_220"><text>Hmm... And indeed. A key, and in the forest a lock. Well, see ya. I'll drop by again sometime, and you'll tell me about other secrets. And... calm down. It's bad for you. I'll go, and you sit quietly, don't think about the stone until I leave.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_2023"><text>Well yes, well yes. Me. How are you yourself? Alright? Got something to talk about.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_2033"><text>Not for me. There. Everything was. But here - empty. Living without what exists. He. Took and here...</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_2041"><text>You should. Drink something maybe. Might feel better... Will you drink vodka?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_2042"><text>Cool it, sicko! You answer me straight - is there something in your head?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_2051"><text>Yes! Yes! Vodka. Give. It's burning there! Everything burned down, only ghosts remained. He.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_20511"><text>Here. Don't pour it down your collar... And what ghosts?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_20512"><text>But there's no vodka... I'll drop by later.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_20513"><text>Ghost... Was looking. I found, but didn't tell. Told another.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_20514"><text>You found something again, what a lucky guy. And what is it?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_20515"><text>Tool... Found. And took apart, stone inside it. Wanted to take. But there's no stone there. Then hid... Don't remember.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_20516"><text>Mmm... You found it? And who else did you tell?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_20517"><text>Don't... remember. Redhead... in tank. In forest. Was smart, with ghost. Told him where, but didn't tell his ghost. Got angry at me...</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_20518"><text>Redhead in tank? Or what? And who got angry - the smart guy or his ghost?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_20519"><text>Ghost... ghost... go away. There was tank, redhead. Don't remember anything...</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_20520"><text>Hey! Wait! What kind of tool? And what was inside?</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_20521"><text>Nothing there... It burns. Vodka, vodka. Give!</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_20522"><text>I won't give you anything else... Everything's clear with you - psycho.</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_2052"><text>Get lost! I'm a psycho, and I have a certificate! I'll strangle you!</text></string>
<string id="psih_dialog_start_2053"><text>Idiot...</text></string>

<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_101"><text>Good health to you, stalker! What's your name? If not for you, some creatures would be eating me.</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_102"><text>I'm Marked One. What happened?</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_103"><text>My story's pretty banal. Saw an artifact. Got close and... Got hit on the dome with something heavy. Some scumbags were lying in wait. While I was out - they pulled everything out. Bastards. While I was lying here, thought I'd get better - bullshit! And now... Stayed alive and that's good... Just a shame, got nothing to thank you with. Ah! Here's binoculars they left... Need them?</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_104"><text>Sure, will come in handy. What kind of scumbags?</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_105"><text>Take them... Just ordinary ones. Would crush the bastards. But we just can't unite, everyone goes alone, so they take advantage. Through my knockout I kinda heard they gathered a pile of loot to drag to Borov. Went north, to the Valley, the bastards...</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_106"><text>I see. Alright, see ya. I'm going my own way...</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_1061"><text>Listen, bandits are pressuring people at the vehicle graveyard.</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_107"><text>Those bastards! Always like that, gang up on one or two and bolt quickly. Go look for wind in the field...</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_108"><text>Well here's just the case when you can catch them red-handed. It's known they'll show up at the vehicle graveyard by evening. Bes is gathering a team for ambush there. Will you join?</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_109"><text>Hmm... Bes? I heard he's not particularly clean himself... Well-l-l I'll think about it. I still haven't recovered from that hit to the head, seeing double. What kind of fighter am I? I'll just get in the way...</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_201"><text>Good journey to you, Marked One...</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_301"><text>I was told here that you're interested in Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_302"><text>Yeah. Know anything about him?</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_303"><text>I once talked with Lyoha. I got lucky then, got into a shootout between Clear Sky guys and bandits. Well watched from the side how they wasted each other... What stupidity, right? Anyway, took a lot of junk from the departed and went to him, to the Sanatorium. Drank, ate, talked about life... Lyoha mentioned that someone from Strelok's group brought him something unusual, some kind of gun. If you get a chance - talk to him. Lyoha was really angry at this Strelok then. Probably knows something specific...</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_304"><text>Lyoha, who's he?</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_305"><text>Well, this... Junkman. Sits in the Sanatorium. Trades various busted junk for medicine. Everyone knows him...</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_3050"><text>Ah... That one. I thought you meant someone else.</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_3051"><text>There's no other one like him.</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_3052"><text>And how do you carry junk, through Cordon?</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_3053"><text>Why run so far... You can enter from Garbage. In the woods, behind the swamp, there's an old collector. Through it you'll get to the Sanatorium.</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_306"><text>Alright, we'll see...</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_3061"><text>Listen, bandits are pressuring people at the vehicle graveyard.</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_307"><text>Those bastards! Always like that, gang up on one or two and bolt quickly. Go look for wind in the field...</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_308"><text>Well here's just the case when you can catch them red-handed. It's known they'll show up at the vehicle graveyard by evening. Bes is gathering a team for ambush there. Will you join?</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_309"><text>Hmm... Bes? I heard he's not particularly clean himself... But I'll think about it. Honestly, still haven't recovered from that hit. Head spins sometimes, seeing double, hands shake. What kind of fighter am I? I'll just get in the way.</text></string>
<string id="gar_stalker_les_dialog_401"><text>How's life, Marked One? I see you look pretty good.</text></string>

<string id="bar_dolg_zastava1_1011"><text>From Garbage? How's our Prapor there, alive, smoker?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava1_1012"><text>The soldiers got all worked up lately. Don't know why?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava1_1013"><text>You should, you know, get going from here. Or some brass will show up for inspection and see that I'm shooting the breeze with you here...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava1_1014"><text>How's the loot? Haven't carried out all of Garbage yet?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava1_1015"><text>Man, dogs keep attacking constantly! Don't accidentally get in the crosshairs...</text></string>

<string id="bar_dolg_zastava1_2011"><text>Heard you got business with our general? You're rising.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava1_2012"><text>Wasn't it you who stirred up trouble at Agroprom? Ah, anyway, what's it to me...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava1_2013"><text>You got access to Voronin, they say? Probably there's a reason for it.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava1_2014"><text>How sick of everything! These duties, inspections, damn bar...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava1_2015"><text>No contact again with our guys at Garbage. Wonder if they're alive...</text></string>

<string id="bar_dolg_zastava2_1011"><text>You better run through quickly before the monsters charge again.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava2_1012"><text>Man, don't hang around here, you might catch a stray bullet by accident.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava2_1013"><text>No desire to help? You look military. Duty needs people like that.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava2_1014"><text>No time for you now. Come to the bar later, we'll talk there.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava2_1015"><text>Be more careful, stalker. Blind dogs always hang around nearby.</text></string>

<string id="bar_dolg_zastava2_2011"><text>Hello! Someone from ours told me about you. They say you're a stand-up guy.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava2_2012"><text>Oh! You're that... Marked One, right? I heard you earned respect from our guys.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava2_2013"><text>Don't loom around here, okay? Forward scouts reported that mutants are stirring again in the area.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava2_2014"><text>Want some free advice? Right behind our outpost the wasteland begins. Don't go there. Wild Territory didn't get its name for nothing.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_zastava2_2015"><text>If you're planning to head to the Army Warehouses, keep in mind they recently heard a chimera roaring in that direction.</text></string>
<!-- ??????????? -->
<string id="bar_dolg_angar_101"><text>Hello, man. We don't know each other? I think I saw you somewhere. Or it just seemed...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_angar_102"><text>Well, hi. I have memory problems myself. So maybe we do know each other, but I don't remember. Come on, strain your mind. Do you recognize me?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_angar_103"><text>I'd strain it, but not now. Gotta somehow stand guard until the end, but I got no strength left. These "righteous" ones wore me out... When they invited me to Duty, they promised there'd be money and gear. But in reality - stand here like an idiot, watch for order, like a security guard at a market. E-eh...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_angar_104"><text>Yeah. Maybe we'll talk when you get off shift then?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_angar_105"><text>You know what... What did you say your name was?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_angar_106"><text>Now it's Marked One. And what I was called before - no idea.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_angar_107"><text>And everyone here calls me Lucky. But that's a long story...\nYou, Marked One, come by the bar early morning. We'll drink, chat. Maybe I'll really remember something about you...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_angar_108"><text>Deal.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_angar_201"><text>Marked One, I can't talk now. Look for me at the bar in the morning, okay?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_angar_202"><text>Got it. See you there.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_angar_301"><text>Get lost.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_angar_bar_101"><text>Hello, man. We don't know each other? I think I saw you somewhere. Or it just seemed...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_102"><text>Well, hi. I have memory problems myself. So maybe we do know each other, but I don't remember. Come on, strain your mind. Do you recognize me?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_103"><text>I actually came here to relax, not strain myself. If you knew how these "righteous" ones wore me out... When they invited me to Duty, they promised there'd be money and gear. But in reality - you stand for half a day like a security guard at a market, keeping watch for order. Ugh... Come on, maybe we'll have a drink to getting acquainted? What's your name, by the way?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_104"><text>Now they call me Marked One. And what I was called before - no idea. Wait before drinking. So do you remember me or not?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_105"><text>Yeah the face seems familiar... Everyone here calls me Lucky, if you're wondering. But that's a long story...\nHere's the thing, Marked One. I'm tired. You'd splash me some white stuff, maybe it would clear up in my head. Maybe I'll really remember something about you then...</text></string>

<string id="dolg_angar_bar_201"><text>Marked One, is that you? How about five drops each? To clear up the brains.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_202"><text>Will there be any point? Oh, I'm doubting something.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_203"><text>I once came across an old newspaper, and there was an article about some folk healer. He claims that alcohol in moderate doses stimulates mental activity. Expands blood vessels or something. And we'll be - exclusively moderate. Pour it, in short.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_2041"><text>Pour, pour... Hell with you! Let's go!</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_2042"><text>The pourer's broken. Another time, maybe.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_205"><text>There... feel it? Already started expanding. Let's immediately chase the first one to consolidate success.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_206"><text>Now... Shuddered!</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_207"><text>The fog in my head almost cleared. A little more and crystal clarity will come. Continue?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_208"><text>Enough. You yourself just talked about moderation. Let's return to the main question on the agenda: do you know me?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_209"><text>Eh... Don't be angry, Marked One, I mistook you. You look like my buddy, Mishka Potapenko. We used to go AWOL together... that was still in training, before I got to the Zone. Haven't seen him for two years already. He wanted to go work in Europe and stay there. Maybe he left, I don't know. Eh... let's have another shot, eh?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_210"><text>I knew it. Waste of time. Find yourself other drinking buddies.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_angar_bar_301"><text>Hello, bro! Will you drink with me?</text></string>

<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_0"><text>Some other time. I'm here on business.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_1"><text>Yeah? Well then lay it out, what's on your mind.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_2"><text>Remember, you said the bosses got on your nerves? Like, they promised one thing, but in reality - no decent pay, no good gear, no meaningful work... Deceived your best expectations, in short. Was that the case?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_3"><text>Well... I was exaggerating a bit, for effect. But generally, yeah, I even thought about writing a report, turning in my gun and parting with this shop amicably. But then I thought: what exactly am I fussing about?! The work isn't dusty, and that they pay little - well risk bonuses are only for those who work in the field. But in raids you can easily lose your head.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_41"><text>They pay little? What if you were offered to improve your financial situation in exchange for a small favor?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_42"><text>Logical. And here, on the territory, is it really that safe? Mutant packs regularly come out to your outposts, as I understand.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_51"><text>What? What kind of favor?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_52"><text>So they shoot them at the outposts. It happens, of course, they break through sometimes, and there are plenty of holes around, but we catch such ones quickly with the whole community. Except at night it's really scary. Especially when you're standing guard alone. Last week there was a case: a pseudodog dug a passage under the fence, wandered into the warehouse yard in the darkness, and mauled the sentry to death. Nobody noticed until the sergeant stumbled on the body.</text></string>
<!-- ???????? ?? 51 ????? -->
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_611"><text>One guy would like to transport cargo through your territory, but quietly, without publicity. Ready to pay well to whoever would help out.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_612"><text>Just, you know, nothing special. Need to drag some cargo through the general's domain. And without extra attention. Compensation guaranteed.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_6111"><text>I see. Aren't you a planted spy, dear man? Singing like a nightingale here, you know... This is like a test, right? Confess while it's good! Who sent you? Ivantsov? Him, right?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_6112"><text>I see. Aren't you a planted spy, dear man? Singing like a nightingale here, you know... Confess while it's good! Who sent you? Aren't you from Borov's gang of scumbags? Hey, guys! Looks like a disguised bandit here!</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_61111"><text>Hey, friend, calm down! I'm not planted, just joking! Such stupid humor I have.</text></string>
<!-- ???????? ?? 52 ????? -->
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_621"><text>Well, you tell me! I understand that there's such darkness you could poke your eye out, but don't they even give you flashlights for night duties? What's the use of such a guard if he can't see shit a couple steps from himself!</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_622"><text>Yes, the organization of service is not up to par, to put it mildly. Better then to really go on mutant raids - at least you can make some money. However, there's an option to rise up nicely even in your rear position. What do you think, if you were offered to improve your financial situation in exchange for a small favor, would you agree?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_721"><text>That's just it, they don't give them out. Shining all night - no batteries would be enough, they say. And there are few flashlights themselves, if our supply guys are to be believed. There are searchlights at checkpoints, lighting in the Bar, at our headquarters, some other places around the territory. But you still can't stick a flashlight in every dark corner, and night vision is a terrible shortage. They only give them to those who go on long mutant raids.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_81"><text>What cheapskates your commanders are. Maybe someone just has their own little business, selling supplies meant for you on the side?! And what, very likely. You know, in that case you could with clear conscience also have your own little profit. Purely to improve financial situation. In exchange for a small favor.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_82"><text>And what do you think to do? Will you keep screwing around until someone else gets torn apart? Soon you'll get to deserters.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_9"><text>Saving the drowning is primarily the business of you know who. I talked here with knowledgeable guys from your shop. Turns out local science doesn't stand still. Eggheads who sit somewhere in the Swamp learned to make special pills that allow a person to see in the dark for some time. Called "Dog's Eye" or something.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_10"><text>Not "dog's" but "cat's", but otherwise correct. The quartermaster at the science camp trades them for various monster guts or artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_11"><text>Right, that's what they told me. I'd love to get there somehow, but who would let me go? Leave isn't soon. And I got nothing to offer for trade - I'm not a stalker.\nListen, Marked One, you seem like an experienced guy, probably been to the Swamp, right? Maybe you'll drop by those eggheads, get me some pills, about 20? I'll find a way to thank you, you won't be at a loss, I promise.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_111"><text>No problem. It's right on my way. Only instead of thanks I'll also ask you for a small favor, deal?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_112"><text>Sure I won't be? They'll ask plenty for 20 pills. Quite a safari ahead, or I'll have to crack open my stash of artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_121"><text>About a favor? What favor? And by the way, you said at the beginning of the conversation you had some business...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_122"><text>I'll find a way to compensate, don't worry. And if it's not enough, we'll work something out. By the way, you said at the beginning of the conversation you had some business...</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_start_dialog_13"><text>We'll discuss when I return from the Swamp.</text></string>
<string id="tex_dolg_dummy_quest_article"><text>Lucky, a Duty fighter, asks to bring him "Cat's Eye" pills, 20 pieces, so it won't be so scary to stand guard at night.</text></string>

<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_done_dialog_0"><text>Still drinking, Lucky? I visited the Swamp and got what you asked for.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_done_dialog_1"><text>This... "dog's eye", right? Cool! Pour them into my pouch. I'll definitely test them tonight.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_done_dialog_2"><text>Here are your pills. Now let's talk about what's due to me, if you don't mind.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_done_dialog_3"><text>Judging by your look and mood, there should be a lot due. Did they really rip you off that bad?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_done_dialog_41"><text>Doesn't matter. I warned you I'd ask for a return favor, not payment for overhead costs with a bonus on top.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_done_dialog_42"><text>Ripped off or not, I had to invest quite a bit. So I want, besides expense reimbursement, to additionally ask for something. Especially since it won't cost you anything. Rather the opposite - you'll profit yourself.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_done_dialog_51"><text>Well, yeah, exactly. And what do you want from me?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_done_dialog_52"><text>Even so? Curious. Continue.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_done_dialog_61"><text>Not me, another person. He'd prefer to remain incognito, so he'll communicate with you exclusively through PDA. And for that he needs your device's communication code.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_done_dialog_62"><text>I'm only acting as an intermediary, the request comes from... another person. He'd prefer to remain incognito, so he'll communicate with you exclusively through PDA. And for that he needs your device's communication code.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_done_dialog_71"><text>Ah, I get it. So from an unregistered PDA you can connect to another directly, by its code. Heard about that. And what does this mysterious Mr. "X" need?</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_done_dialog_81"><text>One-time help with moving some cargo through Duty territory. So it's without noise and dust. He'll thank you from the heart. That's all. You'll discuss details yourselves. I need your agreement in principle, well and the communication code.</text></string>
<string id="dolg_dummy_quest_done_dialog_91"><text>Not planning to smuggle a nuclear bomb, I hope? Alright, you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. I'll try to help if we agree on price. I'll copy the communication code for you now...\nAnd also. I don't know what they promised you for my "recruitment", but I'd like to repay you for the help. Especially since you trusted me and got the pills at your own expense.\nThere was a small skirmish here a month ago. Some random mercs showed up at the northern outpost, our guys shot them all. One of the trophy guns taken from them, I won that same night in cards from a direct participant in the shooting. But I don't use it because it's NATO caliber, and they don't issue us such ammo. I'm giving it to you basically. Only you'll have to go get it, it's not far. As you head toward the Army Warehouses, on the left side of the road there'll be a "gap" between two buildings, where dogs always make their den. You'll see a cross by the fence - that's where I hid the gun.</text></string>

Especially since you trusted me and got the pills at your own expense.\nWhen I was seriously considering whether to bail from Duty, I started preparing an emergency stash so I wouldn't be left bare-assed when I turn in my gear. Put everything in a cache nearby. Own it basically. As you head toward the Army Warehouses, on the left side of the road there'll be a "gap" between two buildings, where dogs always make their den.

<string id="lost_desertir1_dialog_start_103"><text>Like... sitting here. Got anything to eat? We traded bread from the local guys for ammo, but can you really get full on that?! We could use a couple cans or some sausage... we'd even agree to that stalker crap. You got any?</text></string>
<string id="lost_desertir1_dialog_start_1041"><text>Here, I got some sausage...</text></string>

<string id="lost_desertir1_dialog_start_107"><text>We... this... in short... we're on the run.</text></string>
<string id="lost_desertir1_dialog_start_108"><text>On the run?! So it's you the captain from the oil pumping station is looking for... You were supposed to guard scientists? And where are the assistants? What happened to them?</text></string>
<string id="lost_desertir1_dialog_start_109"><text>We don't know, they disappeared... We escorted them to the burned village in the Swamp. There, in the house, there's this ball, shimmering. They approached that bubble, took some device out of a box... Argued about something... Turned it on... And then... Screams, shrieks and voices, like from a grave, definitely not theirs, others, many... and flashes. White, then bloody, then white again... and it got dark, like night. Came to - head doesn't work, ringing in ears, and the eggheads are gone. My grandma told me about hell when I was a kid - exactly the same.</text></string>
<string id="lost_desertir1_dialog_start_110"><text>Don't drag your grandma into this. What happened next?</text></string>
<string id="lost_desertir1_dialog_start_111"><text>What next... Bolted from there, wherever our eyes looked, didn't understand anything. Only came to our senses here. Now we're hiding. They'll blame us for those scientists, and we're done for, sure as shit.</text></string>
<string id="lost_desertir1_dialog_start_112"><text>Done for or not - it's not for me to decide... And those eggheads didn't say why they went to that bubble. What did they want there?</text></string>
<string id="lost_desertir1_dialog_start_113"><text>You gotta understand them. This scientific brotherhood talks in some kind of their own, fancy language... They talked about some holes. About how you can move somewhere and come back.</text></string>
<string id="lost_desertir1_dialog_start_114"><text>So maybe - they already returned?! Though they're not at the base. Maybe monsters ate them on the way...</text></string>
<string id="lost_desertir1_dialog_start_115"><text>Marked One, one thing I can say for sure, they weren't planning to fly anywhere. I saw their faces. Eyes were mad, terror in them.

<string id="borov_start_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, I got one special offer. Keep in mind, I don't voice it to just anyone, but for you, I think, it might come in handy someday.</text></string>
<string id="borov_start_dialog_202"><text>Something tells me I don't trust your offers, but I can listen, why not?</text></string>
<string id="borov_start_dialog_203"><text>I know that you stalkers sometimes like to start trouble out of nowhere. Someone can't share loot, someone doesn't watch their mouth, and someone grabs for iron when drunk. Anyway, if you get some misunderstandings with "colleagues", I can step in and sort everything out. For the mediator role I charge dearly, two grand in green, but I guarantee results. Of course, provided you don't manage to turn half the Zone against you. Yeah, there's one more thing. I won't go to bat for you again if you screw up after. Not by the code. Nobody likes troublemakers and psychos.</text></string>

<string id="borov_need_rep_up_0"><text>Borov, you said you could go to bat for me if I ask. So it happened that I'm at odds with some folks...</text></string>
<string id="borov_need_rep_up_1"><text>Hold up! Important clarification: if you ask and throw in the green stuff, as much as said - two grand in green.</text></string>

<string id="borov_need_rep_up_22"><text>I thought you were joking about two grand. Where does an honest stalker get such money?</text></string>
<string id="borov_need_rep_up_3"><text>Now listen and remember. I'm givin' you this gadget - radio frequency scanner. You get close to where your enemies hang out. Don't need to get too close, or they might start shootin'. Press the button and hang around for five minutes while the little device picks up frequencies of all PDAs in the area and sends them to my guy. He sends messages to these PDAs, like, you got confused about somethin', losers, Marked One's a stand-up guy, you gotta back off.</text></string>
<string id="borov_need_rep_up_4"><text>And how's that supposed to work? You'd think someone would bother figuring out what some unknown person is writing to them...</text></string>
<string id="borov_need_rep_up_5"><text>Not your worry how it'll work. Some we'll scare, some we'll buy, some we'll con. You can find leverage on anyone, if there's desire. Or almost anyone. Against soldiers, mercs and criminal psychos I got no methods. Well, and I warned you: if you're in deep shit and even the most pathetic newbie rookie from the village at Cordon dreams of wasting you, then I fold, deal with such mess yourself.</text></string>
<string id="borov_need_rep_up_6"><text>I see. I admit, I'm surprised that... a person of your profession uses such high-tech solutions.</text></string>
<string id="borov_need_rep_up_7"><text>What, ya thought we're lappin' up soup with bark shoes here? We're keepin' up with the times, like. Got myself a specialist. Tech guy, electronics. Did time in the slammer for raisin' hell big time in Kiev back in the day: stuffed some homemade crap into ATMs that burned all the data from rich suckers' cards. Made enough dough for a new Beemer in a month. Got out recently, no bearings. Well, and headed to the Zone. Now he's with the crew.</text></string>

<string id="borov_11_dialog_4"><text>How's that? Wanna set me up!</text></string>
<string id="borov_11_dialog_5"><text>Come on, don't be scared, I can see who I'm dealin' with. Recently a chopper crashed not far - east of the swamp... Why - dunno, it was comin' from the center of the Zone, smoke was half the sky. I sent my morons to check what's there and how, but there turned out to be a chimera den nearby, so my bros chickened out gettin' closer. Only saw that there's a couple corpses by the chopper and some junk scattered around.\nSo maybe you'll try your luck? Poke around there, if there's somethin' interesting, bring it, then we'll talk about what I know about the underground and maybe cook up a couple more deals...</text></string>
<string id="borov_11_dialog_6"><text>Yeah... Your soldiers, scared of chimeras... I'll go check...</text></string>

<string id="borov_11_add_dialog_3"><text>What ya pretendin' for? I think I explained clearly: south of here there's a swamp, road goes through it, seen it? If you're walkin' from here, turn your noggin left at the bridge, you'll see a hill behind the swamp... Look behind it. Damn!</text></string>
<string id="borov_11_add_dialog_4"><text>Alright! Swamp! Hill! There's swamps and hills all around here... I'm outta here!</text></string>

<string id="borov_12_dialog_0"><text>I was by the helicopter, the chimeras ain't that scary...</text></string>
<string id="borov_12_dialog_1"><text>So you were. I sent my boys to tail you, somethin' I didn't get their report... What was there? In the helicopter?</text></string>
<string id="borov_12_dialog_2"><text>There was nothin' there... Couple egghead corpses, that's all...</text></string>
<string id="borov_12_dialog_3"><text>I found somethin': container with some kinda artifact, which exactly, dunno, I didn't risk openin' it, and some documents...</text></string>

<string id="voron_help_entres_dialog_2"><text>I found out how to get into the underground, not far from here, at the factory. Only the entrance is blocked. Not such a big blockage there. If we gather about 5 guys, we can clear it in half a day. Won't you help? I'm addressing you as a local old-timer.</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_entres_dialog_3"><text>Clear the blockage at the factory? That's where Borov's renegades settled?</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_entres_dialog_41"><text>I think I heard you guys have some kind of truce with the bandits? And they even... fear you. Or are they lying?</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_entres_dialog_42"><text>There's nobody there anymore...</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_entres_dialog_51"><text>Lying or not, but we need to negotiate with them. You understand... foreign territory, foreign rules.</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_entres_dialog_52"><text>That doesn't change anything. Today it's some, tomorrow others will come. We'll still have to negotiate. You understand... foreign territory, foreign rules.</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_entres_dialog_6"><text>So what to do?</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_entres_dialog_7"><text>I'll figure out what to interest people with for such work. And we'll have to pay for the agreement with the punks.</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_entres_dialog_8"><text>Raven, you understand, in that laboratory there could be a bunch of interesting stuff.</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_entres_dialog_9"><text>Death is there - that I know for sure. And there might not be any loot! So, let's do this - bring five "Gravi" level artifacts, and make sure they're in good condition. Maybe the boys will get interested. There'll be some left for the bros too.</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_entres_dialog_91"><text>Artifacts? I'll try to collect them.</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_entres_dialog_92"><text>Artifacts? That's quite a demand. I'll think about it.</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_entres_dialog_10"><text>Let's agree right away - once you collect all the artifacts, then we'll talk.</text></string>
<string id="tex_voron_help_entres_article"><text>Raven: for five second-level artifacts in good condition promises to organize stalkers to clear the blockage for passage into the old laboratory.</text></string>

<string id="voron_help_me_entres_dialog_0"><text>I'm here about clearing the blockage.</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_me_entres_dialog_1"><text>Brought artifacts? I remind you, we agreed on five pieces of second level and in good condition. If you have that many, then everything's fine.</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_me_entres_dialog_21"><text>Yes, I collected everything.</text></string>

You take a walk meanwhile, when it's ready, I'll send a message. Well if you don't get it - come by tomorrow, I think it'll be ready.\nBy the way... People say that all former underground laboratories were sealed. And so that outsiders wouldn't stick their noses in - they pumped in poisonous gas. So in a regular suit, with a gas mask, you better not go in there. You won't last long, you'll suffocate. Here you need a suit with a closed breathing system, and better yet a power armor. Each faction has analogs, but it's exclusive merchandise, you can't just get it or buy it. A scientific suit would work too, but for that you need to go to the scientists at Yantar.</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_me_entres_dialog_4"><text>Thanks for the warning... Listen, maybe you have a suitable suit so I don't have to go looking around?</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_me_entres_dialog_5"><text>Actually have one, though it needs significant repair. The former owner managed to crash into "Jelly" in it... But it's quality stuff, can be patched up by local craftsmen, no problem. Half the Freedom guys swagger around in such suits. Ready to let it go for a thousand bucks. Bearer check. Does that work?</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_me_entres_dialog_6"><text>Bit pricey... let me think.</text></string>
<string id="voron_help_me_entres_dialog_7"><text>Think, just not too long. Another stalker was already interested in this suit. But I'll hold it for you for now.</text></string>

<string id="voron_scafandr_dialog_0"><text>About the suit for descending into the laboratory - is the offer still valid?</text></string>
<string id="voron_scafandr_dialog_1"><text>So far yes, I'm giving it for a thousand bucks. Will you take it?</text></string>
<string id="voron_scafandr_dialog_21"><text>Yes, here's the check.</text></string>
<string id="voron_scafandr_dialog_22"><text>Haven't decided yet. Just dropped by to check, in case it's no longer available.</text></string>
<string id="voron_scafandr_dialog_3"><text>Try on the suit. Just don't forget to take it for repair before descending into the lab in it.</text></string>

If there's such a need for workforce, then, according to this list, bring provisions. Not much here: 30 cans of stew, same amount of bread, 10 bottles of vodka, and anti-hangover, 20 cans.</text></string>
<string id="kulinar_help_entres_dialog_8"><text>How much, how much?!</text></string>
<string id="kulinar_help_entres_dialog_9"><text>That's not all... We have a shortage of buckshot here, but with mutants, as luck would have it, no shortage. So along with provisions grab another 300 rounds... Now that's everything. I'd advise visiting Sidorovich. He always has goods in abundance.</text></string>
<string id="kulinar_help_entres_dialog_91"><text>Well... I guess I'll try to get it.</text></string>
<string id="kulinar_help_entres_dialog_92"><text>He advises. Won't your "serious people" get sick?</text></string>
<string id="kulinar_help_entres_dialog_10"><text>Just don't drag it out too long.</text></string>
<string id="tex_kulinar_help_entres"><text>Cook: for 30 cans of stew, 30 loaves of bread, 10 bottles of vodka, 20 cans of energy drink and 300 shotgun shells, promises to organize stalkers to clear the blockage for passage into the old laboratory. Advised to contact Sidorovich for provisions</text></string>

<string id="kulinar_help_me_entres_dialog_0"><text>I'm here about clearing the blockage.</text></string>
<string id="kulinar_help_me_entres_dialog_11"><text>Marked One, you were bragging there about clearing all the approaches? But I heard that you didn't deal with the bandits, and ran away in shame. Is that so?</text></string>
<string id="kulinar_help_me_entres_dialog_13"><text>How so? It was clear.</text></string>
<string id="kulinar_help_me_entres_dialog_12"><text>Don't chicken out. Everything's agreed, you provide the provisions and ammo, we do the work.</text></string>
<string id="kulinar_help_me_entres_dialog_21"><text>Then take the goods.</text></string>
<string id="kulinar_help_me_entres_dialog_22"><text>Hmm... Alright, I'll go get them.</text></string>
<string id="kulinar_help_me_entres_dialog_3"><text>Well, as agreed, so it shall be done.... This work isn't easy. You go take a walk for half a day or so. When we finish, I'll give a signal. Get ready...\nAnd one more thing. My friendly advice to you. Find a good suit with a closed breathing system, or better yet - power armor. People say that some kind of gas was released into all the old underground laboratories so that outsiders like you wouldn't stick their nose in there. Every faction has such suits, but they're rare goods, you can't just buy them. Scientists have them too. Ask around at Yantar.</text></string>
<string id="kulinar_help_me_entres_dialog_4"><text>Thanks for the advice... Then I'll wait for the signal.</text></string>
<!-- Barman_zaval -->
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_0"><text>About the laboratory in the Dark Valley.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_11"><text>The one that's X-18? Interesting! Been there? What does it look like? Any data on our problem with the "Brain Scorcher"?</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_12"><text>I found out how to get into those underground areas. Only the entrance is blocked, but not such a big blockage there. If we gather about five guys, we can clear it in half a day. Then we can get inside. Won't you organize the people?</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_1"><text>Clear the blockage? In the Dark Valley? Hmm... No, while bandits are clustered there, no one will take on this job.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_21"><text>Well I'll deal with them.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_22"><text>There's nobody there. I already cleared the approaches.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_31"><text>When you deal with them, then come back.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_32"><text>Cleared them, you say? Hmm... And what will you pay with?</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_41"><text>Don't worry. I said it - so I'll do it!</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_42"><text>Well... Maybe some favor is needed or some goods?</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_5"><text>Clear the blockage? In the Dark Valley? Hmm... It'll be hard to convince the guys for such a thing. You know our stalkers - they won't even scratch their own ass for free. Will need to pay. Do you have decent savings? Will need to fork out about a thousand bucks each, no less... You say four will handle it? Well, two more will definitely need to be posted as guards, you never know - the place is dangerous! So, about six thousand green ones.\nAlright, I do have my own interest in this matter. And someone else too. Let's do this - I'll take two-thirds of the expenses on myself. You'll have a trifle left - one hundred thousand rubles. Not much, in general...</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_61"><text>Agreed, I'll go scrape the bottom of the barrel.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_62"><text>One hundred grand?! That's a bit much.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_entres_dialog_7"><text>Good then. And I'll think about who this job can be entrusted to.</text></string>
<string id="tex_barman_help_entres"><text>Barman: for 100,000 rubles, promises to organize stalkers to clear the blockage for passage into the old laboratory</text></string>

<string id="barman_help_me_entres_dialog_0"><text>I'm here about clearing the blockage.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_me_entres_dialog_11"><text>Did you already clear all the approaches? But I heard that you can't be trusted - and you didn't deal with the bandits there, but ran away in shame.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_me_entres_dialog_13"><text>So that was me...</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_me_entres_dialog_12"><text>Yes! I already talked to whoever I needed to, people agreed. Waiting for your share and we can start the work.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_me_entres_dialog_21"><text>I managed to collect the needed sum.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_me_entres_dialog_23"><text>Hmm... I don't have enough yet.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_me_entres_dialog_3"><text>Well, as agreed, so it shall be done. This work isn't easy. You go take a walk for half a day, maybe more. When we finish, I'll give a signal. Get ready... I heard that it's not sweet in the underground areas. That's why no one risks going there. There must be a very compelling reason for that... like you have.\nAnd they also say that either the scientists themselves, or their military curators, released poisonous gas into all the old underground laboratories. So, Marked One, my advice to you - find a good suit with a closed breathing system. Better yet - power armor. In ordinary rags with a mask, there's nothing to do there. You'll die.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_me_entres_dialog_4"><text>You couldn't have said that earlier?! What if I had gone there... Well, it's understandable, you wouldn't have grieved.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_me_entres_dialog_5"><text>Don't make noise. You were warned for free anyway.</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_me_entres_dialog_6"><text>So what to do? Where to get a suit?</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_me_entres_dialog_7"><text>I can help with a suit, but not right now. We'll talk a bit later, alright?</text></string>
<string id="barman_help_me_entres_dialog_8"><text>Good, I'll wait for the signal.</text></string>

<string id="krysyk_start_dialog_101"><text>Hey, stalker! Come here, let's talk.</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_start_dialog_102"><text>Are you Rat?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_start_dialog_103"><text>Krysyuk! My last name is Krysyuk!</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_start_dialog_201"><text>Well, any news?</text></string>

<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_0"><text>Alright, whatever I call you, there's one matter I have for you.</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_1"><text>What kind of matter? I don't think I had any dealings with you...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_2"><text>Heard about Borov? He's rolling a barrel on you, wants you to give him your PDA.</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_3"><text>He wants a lot, the coordinates of several of Borov's stashes are recorded there, everything's encrypted though. And there's other... important information. But I'm ready to trade you the device, and you in exchange will fulfill one assignment for me...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_41"><text>What if I wring your neck - won't that help the matter?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_42"><text>Assignment, and what does it consist of?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_51"><text>Wring it, only then you won't see the PDA, I hid it in a secret place.</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_52"><text>I'm afraid of my accomplices... You, I see, really need this Borov PDA? Then there's a business proposition. You know Tooth? He's been sitting in the bar lately, trading in all kinds of information, deceiving suckers. Talk to him, he's an agile guy, can slip into any... Hmm, in general, he can spin different deals. If he negotiates with those debtors to let me in there, then the PDA is yours...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_621"><text>Too-oo-ooth. Think I saw him. What, is he a buddy of yours?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_622"><text>Screw you! You're all pissing me off! Go there, go here...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_61"><text>Alright, I was joking - you had a laugh... What assignment do you have?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_62"><text>You little bastard! You'll tell me everything!</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_63"><text>Yeah right, buddy... He's everyone's buddy, whoever he can shake more dough from. And won't even scratch himself for free. You tell him that, they say, Krysyuk stashed in that cache where Owl used to hide his loot, a couple artifact capsules and one more good artifact. Put it on - and it's like a second wind opens up, you can run away from anyone. Even from chimeras sometimes... The key word - "sometimes", hehehe. Anyway, Tooth knows where this stash is. Let him take it for himself, the dealer...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_64"><text>Hmm... Alright, I'll talk to Tooth.</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_11_dialog_65"><text>Don't doubt it! You won't be left out.</text></string>

<string id="krysyk_borov_dead_entres_dialog_0"><text>Alright, whatever I call you, there's one matter I have for you...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_borov_dead_entres_dialog_1"><text>What kind of matter? I don't think I had any dealings with you?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_borov_dead_entres_dialog_2"><text>Heard about Borov? That pig croaked. But he had some information that I really need.</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_borov_dead_entres_dialog_3"><text>Croaked? For sure? Well good riddance! And what do you want from me? Ah! Think I might know too? And what kind of information?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_borov_dead_entres_dialog_31"><text>They say he knew how to get into the underground laboratory in the Dark Valley?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_borov_dead_entres_dialog_32"><text>Hmm... I heard something like that, seems like Rusty found some dead egghead somewhere who had documents about some underground place. Haven't seen Rusty for a long time. I think the info should be in Borov's PDA. And wouldn't you know, you're in luck - I know where to find that computer. Not for free. You get it?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_borov_dead_entres_dialog_41"><text>What if I wring your neck - won't that help the matter?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_borov_dead_entres_dialog_42"><text>Not for free? Then for what?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_borov_dead_entres_dialog_51"><text>Wring it, only that won't help you, the PDA isn't with me. So, look out for yourself...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_borov_dead_entres_dialog_52"><text>I'm afraid of my accomplices... You, I see, really need this Borov PDA? Then there's a business proposition. You know Tooth?

<string id="krysyk_borov_dead_entres_dialog_65"><text>Don't doubt it! You won't be left out.</text></string>

<string id="krysyk_13_dialog_0"><text>There's a request from one bandit...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_13_dialog_1"><text>From you, by any chance? I haven't seen a more bandit-looking face yet...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_13_dialog_2"><text>Quite the joker. One crook, Rat, wants to hide out in the Bar. Can you organize it?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_13_dialog_3"><text>Rat? What kind of... Ah! That one, Patsyuk. Yeah, I heard he slipped away from his accomplices. It'll be hard to convince the duty officers to turn a blind eye to his past "merits"... Will have to grease many palms. And what will I get from this? If he wants safety, let him pay...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_13_dialog_4"><text>He says he hid a couple artifact capsules and one more new one in a cache...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_13_dialog_5"><text>Who knows what he says! Moscow doesn't believe in words! Ever heard of that?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_13_dialog_6"><text>Says everything's lying in some Owl's stash. Everything will be yours for the work.</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_13_dialog_7"><text>Owl's? Ah... That's in the Valley. Am I out of my mind to go there? And why are you vouching for this, hmm, Krysyuk? Is he your brother-in-law or something? If he croaks - good riddance!</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_13_dialog_8"><text>I need him! He knows something...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_13_dialog_9"><text>Well? If you need him, then let's make a deal like this - go to the Valley, check this stash, if there really is what there is, then bring it here, and then we can have a proper talk. Okay? This stash should be here, if rat-face didn't lie. Or, if you don't mind, give me three level-three artifacts - and it's a done deal... And you'll settle your own business with the ugly mug yourself...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_13_dialog_10"><text>Well... Alright, I'll go take a look.</text></string>

<string id="krysyk_14_dialog_0"><text>I'm here about Krysyuk...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_14_dialog_1"><text>What about him? Did he fall and bump his head? As the Great Helmsman said: "No person - no problem"... Right?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_14_dialog_21"><text>In that stash, in the Dark Valley, there were three artifacts. Two capsules and one - not quite clear...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_14_dialog_31"><text>Interesting... Didn't lie? The things you see in this world. Hand over the artifacts and tell him he can come here, I talked to whoever needed to, they'll let him through the checkpoints.</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_14_dialog_22"><text>I'm thinking, I have three good artifacts...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_14_dialog_32"><text>Why think? Hand over the artifacts and tell him he can come here, I talked to whoever needed to, they'll let him through the checkpoints.</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_14_dialog_42"><text>Give them up? Maybe I'll keep them for myself?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_14_dialog_41"><text>Here, take them...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_14_dialog_51"><text>Alright, let's see how he behaves here. Rat...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_14_dialog_52"><text>Heh-heh, keep them of course, and to hell with your Krysyuk...</text></string>

<string id="krysyk_15_dialog_0"><text>Tooth says you can head to the Bar. Now are you satisfied?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_15_dialog_1"><text>Let's say, more at ease about my life...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_15_dialog_2"><text>What about my share?</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_15_dialog_3"><text>Your share awaits you at Agroprom... Right here... That's where I hid the PDA. And also a good cloak - made from flesh skin.\nAnd... Ah well! There's a way to get "Jellyfish" from various junk...\nYou need to throw a dog tail, tushkano head, boar hoof and a "Thorn" into the "Electra"...</text></string>
<string id="krysyk_15_dialog_4"><text>Alright, I'll check... If you screwed me over, I'll shake your soul out of you...</text></string>

<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_101"><text>Be well... And who are you, don't seem to be one of ours?</text></string>
<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_102"><text>No, not one of yours... I'm the Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_103"><text>Ah! So that's who I heard about, then... Like a scary-looking face... Well... You're supposed to be tough as nails, right? Managed to pass through almost the entire Zone, monsters running in terror to the corners?</text></string>
<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_104"><text>What are you blabbering about?</text></string>
<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_105"><text>Well you're looking for Strelok, I heard. And you came here too, probably not without reason - aiming for Strelok's stash, the one in the mine shaft... Well why are you making those eyes, as if you didn't know?</text></string>
<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_106"><text>Uh... I'm looking for someone who knows me. And what about Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_107"><text>Well... I happened to chat with one fool who hangs around near the base at the Warehouses. Well he's, of course, completely nuts, but he mutters some interesting stuff. From his rambling I understood that in the mine shaft of the former mine, literally nearby, behind the fence on the territory of the Limansk reserve, Strelok stashed a bunch of loot. Immeasurable valuables. And maybe something else interesting too. You get it? Strelok might have left something useful for you there too. Dangerous though, to poke around there. But we're moving out soon. Just need to gather strength, get gear, stock up on ammo. We're waiting for one guy, and meanwhile we had a drink for the road, then another one for the other leg, and away we went... We've been sitting here for the third day now. But look, I'll remember you - don't you dare go there. Whatever you find in that mine - it's all ours. I staked a claim.</text></string>
<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_1081"><text>Hmm? Strelok's stash, you say? Well-well...</text></string>
<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_1082"><text>The old mine behind the fence here? Well I was there...</text></string>
<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_109"><text>When did you manage that? And I'm thinking, what was all that shooting! Well you... Share up. I'm telling you - that loot is ours!</text></string>
<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_110"><text>Yeah, right now...</text></string>
<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_201"><text>Well? Found Strelok's stash? Come on, confess...</text></string>
<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_202"><text>Yeah, found it and already drank it all away...</text></string>
<string id="red_freedom_glavn_dialog_203"><text>Still joking... Well-well...</text></string>

<string id="red_forest_lesnik_strelok_dialog_0"><text>Haven't heard about Strelok's stash somewhere around here?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_strelok_dialog_1"><text>Strelok or not Strelok, I don't know, but many say there was one very lucky stalker here who hid everything he found in some place. There are always freebie lovers around, but judge for yourself - if it was so simple, it would have been known long ago.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_strelok_dialog_2"><text>What about some mine or shaft, somewhere around here nearby?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_strelok_dialog_3"><text>Ah, that one. They used to mine some rare ore there, but then it became unprofitable and was abandoned. For a while several fanatics from a sect clustered there. Well those ones who worship the Monolith. But something didn't work out for them there. Either they lost something important, or something else, but one day they weren't there anymore. No one even saw how they left. And monsters started appearing in the mine in droves, as if crawling out of some burrow.\nThe entrance is very close - you leave from me, the gates lead to the reserve, when you enter, turn right and along the fence... And there you'll see.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_strelok_dialog_4"><text>I see. So there's no stash there?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_strelok_dialog_5"><text>I don't know what someone could have hidden there... And they've been talking about this stash for a long time. They searched for it, searched, but haven't found it yet. Saw some guys around here nearby? Also "seekers"... On the other hand, maybe it's true: how does everyone know that Strelok's stash should be here? Although... What kind of stash is it that almost everyone in the Zone is looking for... An open secret. It's all bullshit, probably?</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_strelok_dialog_6"><text>Maybe it is bullshit. Only I don't have other threads to the past. Probably will have to pay a visit.</text></string>
<string id="red_forest_lesnik_strelok_dialog_7"><text>See for yourself. Be careful. The forest itself isn't a resort, and this mine...</text></string>

<string id="mil_kurjer_have_skrjaga_832"><text>Uh-uh, no! I'll try to crack it myself. Maybe I'll find something interesting.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_skrjaga_931"><text>Here, take it! "Green one"! Fresh! Just the other day one stalker brought it... Don't go blabbing about the briefcase though. Okay? You understand...</text></string>
<!-- closing quest and opening on exo -->
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_skrjaga_932"><text>Go ahead and crack it! Look, don't... dig your own grave. And better not spread word about the briefcase. You get it...</text></string>
<!-- closing quest -->
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_skrjaga_64"><text>I found that courier's corpse. He had a briefcase and a PDA on him. What will you give for them?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_skrjaga_74"><text>Yeah, the case looks similar... And why do I need the PDA? Although... for everything I'll give two excellent artifacts. First and second category. Good?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_skrjaga_841"><text>Hmm... Alright, give me your artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_skrjaga_842"><text>Uh-uh, no! I'll try to dig around myself. Maybe I'll discover something interesting.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_skrjaga_941"><text>Here, take them! "Green ones"! Fresh! Just the other day one stalker brought them... Don't spread word about our business in public. I'll throw in some extra cash for keeping quiet.</text></string>

<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_0"><text>Listen, Colonel. There's a story here that seems to concern you.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_1"><text>What do you want?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_2"><text>You're like Voronin's deputy. See, he gave me a job - to find out something at the Warehouses. So, looks like I saw there... well, someone he knew, only dead. That's fine, but there was a case with papers nearby...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_3"><text>So... ?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_4"><text>Hmm. That's not the point. What to tell Voronin now? After all, it turns out that since his man was at the Warehouses with something, then either he was passing it to someone for something, or someone gave it to him... And now I kind of know or suspect...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_5"><text>Aha... and you come straight to me - not to Petrov, Sidorov, but to Ivancov, because I should be delighted to listen to your accusations against Duty leadership... Is that how it is? Did you make up this fable yourself or at someone's suggestion, come on, tell me who sent you to me, blackmailer?!</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_6"><text>But I... I want to help Duty on the contrary... you know how much I've already done for Duty? I've already, you could say, absorbed your idea, and then this! Such confusion... And it would be okay if it was some ordinary soldier...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_7"><text>Stop wriggling! Hey, you two! Come here!</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_8"><text>Wait! I was probably wrong... and it just seemed to me. He's just a courier, I thought his briefcase...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_9"><text>Hey, you two! Back to your post!... Now you have to tell everything, since you blabbed something about a "courier", there's no point hiding the rest! What Voronin said, exactly... And don't yell! They're not cutting yet... Just yet... Come on, spill it, and remember - you have no choice.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_10"><text>Well, he asked me to find out about some courier... I found a corpse matching the description. A briefcase nearby. That's all.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_11"><text>No, not all. Now they'll take you to the basement, and there it will be all. What's in the briefcase!? Come on!</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_121"><text>How would I know? Bloodsucker chased me, and the case was heavy, so I dropped it... Why such a reaction all of a sudden?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_122"><text>Encrypted papers, nothing understandable... I stashed it for the time being...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_123"><text>Don't freak out, take this damn briefcase... Sort it out yourselves.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_131"><text>Listen here: run back to that bloodsucker and make sure the briefcase is with me tomorrow. And don't you dare tell anyone. Clear?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_132"><text>Listen here: you have 24 hours and make sure the briefcase is with me. And don't you dare tell anyone. This is your only chance to stay whole. Otherwise an order will be given to every Duty member to shoot you on first approach. Clear?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_133"><text>Well then. You decided correctly. Better to stay on good terms with me. Duty doesn't consist only of Voronin.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_14"><text>We'll see... get lost.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_ivancov_15"><text>I already got that, bye.</text></string>

<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_ivancov_0"><text>I'm here about the courier's briefcase...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_ivancov_1"><text>Get to the point, where is it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_ivancov_21"><text>I found it, thankfully the bloodsucker didn't crush it. Here, take it...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_ivancov_22"><text>I can't find it yet, need more time...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_ivancov_31"><text>Well then. You decided correctly. Better to stay on good terms with me. Duty doesn't consist only of Voronin. You're free. For now...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_ivancov_32"><text>I get the feeling you're playing games.\nI'll wait a bit more, and then... It'll be bad...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_ivancov_4"><text>Don't try to scare me, scaredy-cat.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_ivancov_5"><text>I don't like this "for now" of yours.</text></string>

<string id="mil_kurjer_done_ivancov_0"><text>Got a message that you were looking for me?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_ivancov_1"><text>Well I thought a bit. You showed me respect, you could say - showed consciousness. I think such actions should be fairly rewarded...\nWell you know - for good work the most worthy reward is even more dangerous work? Just kidding.\nI can either throw in some cash if you need it, or some ammo, or a small pile of artifacts... What's better?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_ivancov_21"><text>Money wouldn't hurt...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_ivancov_22"><text>Some ammo would be nice.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_ivancov_23"><text>Artifacts wouldn't be extra...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_ivancov_24"><text>Don't need anything, thanks.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_ivancov_31"><text>Here, fifty grand from me, take this dough...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_ivancov_32"><text>Get whatever you need from the Barman. I'll tell him I owe you.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_ivancov_33"><text>Stalker. Life ain't life without artifacts? You know the cross beyond the northern checkpoint? There's a stash there. Take my reward from there. Just hurry, you understand - it's not in a bank under lock.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_ivancov_34"><text>Well then. Be seeing you. I'll remember you.</text></string>

<string id="mil_kurjer_done_barman_0"><text>I'm from Ivancov, the Duty guy. Need ammo.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_barman_1"><text>Yeah, he mentioned it. What kind do you need? 5.45, 5.56, 9-millimeter or maybe for AKM?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_barman_21"><text>Give me the Kalashnikov ones - the 5.45.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_barman_22"><text>I'll take the NATO 5.56.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_barman_23"><text>For the "Vintar", 9-millimeter.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_barman_24"><text>Give me the AKM ones. 7.62 - that's power!</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_barman_3"><text>Take them. What did you cook up with Ivancov? Although... What's it to me...</text></string>

<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_0"><text>About that dead courier from the Warehouses...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_1"><text>Hmm, something additional?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_2"><text>Looks like your courier kicked the bucket...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_3"><text>Kicked what?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_4"><text>Well, meaning he's a corpse. In the village, in the Bloodsucker place. Bloodsucker finished him. By description it's your man.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_5"><text>So... Nothing on him?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_6"><text>Nothing was there... Was he carrying something on himself? I didn't dig through the corpse, it was already... you know...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_7"><text>No, not on himself, but with him.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_8"><text>There was some briefcase lying nearby, I thought it was just junk, but...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_9"><text>Briefcase? What briefcase? What's in it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_10"><text>Interested? Well I got interested too. But there were tons of bloodsuckers there. Were.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_11"><text>Driving up the price? Don't. I have my interest, of course, but not excessive. I need that case! And not empty, as you understand. So what?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_121"><text>Well I couldn't carry it then. Bloodsuckers were there. And it's heavy, that case.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_122"><text>I stashed it, in a notable place, thinking - maybe I should try to figure it out myself.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_123"><text>Here's that very briefcase... And what do I get in return?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_131"><text>What are you talking about?! Anyway, go bring it, just quietly, don't advertise it to anyone here... Then we'll find out whose briefcase it is and what's in it. Task clear?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_133"><text>Well they won't shoot you today - how's that for a reward?\nThat's a joke...\nWhen you're at Yantar - tell them it's from me, Sakharov will give you some. Something good. Don't frown. You should like it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_voronin_14"><text>Now it's clear. Need that briefcase. No one should know.</text></string>

<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_voronin_0"><text>I'm here about the courier's briefcase...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_voronin_1"><text>Well, what's with it? What's inside?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_voronin_21"><text>Here. Brought it. Well I took a peek. Nothing understandable, some squiggles, not letters.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_voronin_22"><text>I can't find it yet, need more time...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_voronin_31"><text>Well then. You decided correctly. Better to stay on good terms with me. Duty - that's me!\nAnd worthy stalkers can find honor by joining our ranks! Well for now, as preliminary compensation, you'll get a worthy reward:\nWhen you're at Yantar - tell them it's from me, Sakharov will give you some. Something good. Don't frown. You should like it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_voronin_32"><text>I get the feeling you're playing games.\nI'll wait a bit more, and then... It'll be bad...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have2_voronin_4"><text>Come on, stop trying to scare me...</text></string>

<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_0"><text>There's a delicate matter. More like a problem, don't know how to resolve it...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_1"><text>Why are you whispering? Constipation or hemorrhoids? You're not the first, nothing to be ashamed of...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_2"><text>Screw you! I'm talking about something else. I've already done something for you and can probably count on your help in return... I think... See, the other day one high-ranking Duty officer gave me a job - to find out about someone at the Warehouses. So, looks like I saw there... well, someone he knew, only dead. That's fine, but there was a case with documents nearby...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_3"><text>So... what's the delicate part? You were too shy to take it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_4"><text>Take it? That's not the point, but what to do with it... After all, it turns out that since his man was at the Warehouses with documents, then either he was passing them to someone for something, or someone gave them to him... And now I kind of know or suspect that the high-ranking officer has some business...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_5"><text>Aha... and you just couldn't keep quiet and hide everything, conscience wouldn't let you? And you ran straight to me to blab everything about the high-ranking officer's dealings at the Warehouses, as if I was pulling your tongue... Is that how it is? What do you want from me?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_6"><text>Well how to put it... you like collecting all kinds of documents? I've brought you some before...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_7"><text>You're offering to sell, but afraid to lose on price, I gather? Come on, let's take a look first before bargaining, why buy a pig in a poke...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_81"><text>Hmm... Maybe I will sell it, I'll think about it more.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_82"><text>Well here's the briefcase. Take a look. How about it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_9"><text>Well... It's all ciphers here... Nothing understandable. I can fork out, say, 70 grand...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_101"><text>Agreed. If something interesting turns up there - give me a shout...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_102"><text>Hell no! Give it back! For such pennies...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_111"><text>Alright, I'll let you know. Take your cash...</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_barman_112"><text>Don't want to - suit yourself. Take your toilet paper. You can go to the crapper...</text></string>

<string id="mil_kurjer_have_docent_0"><text>Accidentally came across an interesting PDA. Shall we read it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_docent_1"><text>Encrypted? Then why do you think it's interesting? Well let's take a look.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_docent_21"><text>Yeah there are a couple indirect signs that the stalker who had this PDA was connected to big people. Well and... You understand. Here, look.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_docent_22"><text>Forget it. Changed my mind.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_docent_3"><text>Uh... Big people, as a rule, are a source of big problems. Like... Big problems - big danger... Well... You understand?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_docent_4"><text>Listen, I've been doing business with you for a while. How much do you want?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_docent_5"><text>Third-level artifact! You understand. Such a matter. And... Payment up front. Well? How about it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_docent_61"><text>Alright, here you go. And don't drag it out.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_docent_62"><text>Only I don't have it with me... I'll go get it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_docent_63"><text>You're asking too much! Give it here, I'll figure it out myself.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_docent_71"><text>Alright, I'll work on it. I'll try to be quick. You should probably come back in half an hour, maybe something will clear up.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_docent_72"><text>Alright, just don't drag it out. You never know.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_have_docent_73"><text>Well yourself, so yourself. Take it. I saw nothing, you said nothing...</text></string>

<string id="mil_kurjer_wait_docent_0"><text>I'm here about that "interesting" PDA.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_wait_docent_1"><text>Huh? Did you bring it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_wait_docent_21"><text>Yeah, here you go. As we agreed.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_wait_docent_22"><text>I'm... well... Wait a bit more, basically.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_wait_docent_23"><text>You're asking too much! Give it here, I'll figure it out myself.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_wait_docent_71"><text>Alright, I'll work on it. I'll try to be quick. You should probably come back in half an hour, maybe something will clear up.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_wait_docent_72"><text>Alright, just don't drag it out. You never know.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_wait_docent_73"><text>Well yourself, so yourself. Take it. I saw nothing, you said nothing...</text></string>

<string id="mil_kurjer_done_docent_0"><text>So what about that "interesting" PDA?</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_docent_1"><text>"Interesting"? We're screwed, brother. Basically, I'm telling you everything and... I know nothing, saw nothing. But, Marked One, you understand, if they corner me, I won't keep quiet.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_docent_2"><text>Don't shake before it's time. I got it all.</text></string>
<string id="mil_kurjer_done_docent_31"><text>Maybe you have three lives, but I have only one. And I want to end it without outside help. Clear?\nAnd for you, in case of probable trouble, I advise looking for the loot that the courier was going to use to pay for his "exit ticket" from the Zone. Maybe you can buy yourself out too, if it really comes to that. As you can guess, it's hidden somewhere at the Warehouses. I didn't find exact directions in the PDA, but there are a couple landmarks. Apparently the guy was afraid he'd forget the place himself.\nAlright, listen. Look for a backpack where construction slabs are piled up, on the road from the Freedom base to the Barrier.</text></string>

<string id="mil_kurjer_done_docent_4"><text>Thanks... Hope everything works out.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="sakharov_mil_kurjer_nagrad_0"><text>Voronin sent me. Said he made arrangements with you regarding my reward.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mil_kurjer_nagrad_1"><text>That's the one who leads the Duty organization? We contact him quite often. From time to time he provides us with support. But, you understand, we're not a warehouse for the needs of passersby.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mil_kurjer_nagrad_2"><text>Uh, he told me, go to Sakharov, he'll reward you. I ran around like a deer following his whims... So he lied?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mil_kurjer_nagrad_3"><text>Hmm... Let's not heat up the situation. I certainly believe you. And I'll provide as confirmation of my respect for you and General Voronin some consumables - medical preparations, food supplies... Also, to somehow calm you down, consider that I'm giving you a very high-quality suit. This is our best model.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mil_kurjer_nagrad_4"><text>Come on, what do you have there. Might come in handy.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mil_kurjer_nagrad_5"><text>Accept this as small consolation.\nAnd please tell Voronin: we are not under his care and don't intend to squander accountable funds left and right. Who knows what he promises.\nOnce again - this doesn't apply to you, Marked One, you know how I respect you.</text></string>

<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_101"><text>Hey, stalker. Come here, warm up. Maybe 150 for mood? We got some - fire running through your veins... I'm Ignat. Kind of run things here. What should we call you?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_102"><text>Hey... I'm the Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_103"><text>Marked, we all are... Marked. They say whoever came to the Zone will forever remain marked... There are almost no artifacts here at all. So only hunting helps us out. Are you a good hunter?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_104"><text>Well I don't know. I shoot pretty well.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_105"><text>Ha, shooting isn't the main thing in hunting. You need to feel the beast. Know its habits, places. Also see - is this the beast you need, and not confuse it with the one that needs you... Right? Big difference. You stalkers are mushroom pickers by nature: found an artifact, sold it, drank it away and again. But we try to be masters. Today you took a beast, tomorrow you waited - studied what and how, day after tomorrow - took much more. Understand? Calculation, skill, cold blood - these are hunter qualities. Few are capable.\nIf you feel the urge to be not a consumer - come, maybe we'll make an apprentice out of you.\nWhat are you looking for anyway?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_106"><text>Uh... I'm looking for someone who knows me. Or about Strelok...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_107"><text>Yeah, guy, when a person doesn't know himself, that's bad. And I heard about Strelok. Long time ago though. Seems like he made himself a den somewhere in the Misty Thicket.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_108"><text>What kind of Thicket is that?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_109"><text>Yeah there's this terrain here, very strange. I haven't gone there myself for a long time and don't advise others to.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_110"><text>Still - how to get there? Maybe I can find something important for my search there... or someone.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_111"><text>You'll find your death there, premature. And I don't want to take extra sin on myself, so sorry, but you won't learn the way there from me.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_112"><text>What kind of horrors are there?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_113"><text>Mysterious place... Time doesn't go there like in the normal world. The sun just rose and it's already evening. Instruments don't work. Sometimes it seems you're walking straight, not turning anywhere, but actually you're cutting circles among three pines. In general, getting lost is easier than easy. And you can also get caught by a wandering anomaly. They're weaker than usual ones, but still, if it hits you - it won't seem like little. And most importantly, dread overcomes you there, for no reason at all.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_114"><text>Yeah, better to have drunk vodka... really unsettling.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_201"><text>Hey, Marked by the Zone. How's life? How's the memory?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_202"><text>No change so far.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_glavn_dialog_203"><text>I sympathize. Although... Sometimes it's better to just live. Not rushing, not fussing. What's needed - it will come by itself. That's what I think...</text></string>

<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_1_dialog_0"><text>What do you guys do anyway?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_1_dialog_1"><text>We hunt certain beasts. Flesh, boars, dogs. There's some demand for what they can give. For example, leather cloaks are made from flesh skins. From meat you can cook pretty good sausage. Well with some additives, of course. From boar hooves they cut all kinds of crafts - they glow in the dark and are warm to touch. Not every hoof and not from every boar, of course... From dog fur and skins very warm shoes are made. And it's good for other things too, from tails we make extract - viagra doesn't even come close. Very profitable business...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_1_dialog_2"><text>I see, why did you settle here specifically?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_1_dialog_3"><text>Places here aren't very visited. Very few artifacts, no direct path to the Zone center, so stalkers don't often drop by. Also there's quite a lot of forest - beasts frolic unafraid. And it's not so far to the exit. In general, I think we'll stay here for now, and then we'll see.\nNot far from here there's also a nice little house, we call it among ourselves the Regional Committee Manor. Maybe it was someone's dacha, some bigwig - from party bosses, maybe something else... Only there at nights the dead rise from the earth - horror! Screw that, it's calmer here...\nWe're hunters, and that says it all...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_1_dialog_4"><text>Hunters. But I saw hunters at the Cordon. They say they guard the tunnel...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_1_dialog_5"><text>Those are Deon's guys? Well he drives his own line. Thinks that hunting is extermination. And calls everyone to this. Well, to each his own. As long as he fulfills his part of obligations towards our group - he's a hunter. And therefore we support him and his guys as we can, and he us, of course.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_1_dialog_6"><text>I see. And you make sausage, you say? Can I try some?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_1_dialog_7"><text>Excellent! Doesn't spoil, very filling, weighs almost nothing - so you can take it on long raids. But not for free, understand. We trade for dog tails - we need them constantly... And hooves too.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_1_dialog_8"><text>Alright, when I have tails...</text></string>

<string id="dar_greens_yantar_way_dialog_0"><text>I'm here on assignment from one of the Duty officers.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yantar_way_dialog_1"><text>From Voronin or what? Seems like they turn their noses up from common folk there. Like - "We're DUTY! And you're nobody"... Well screw them... What did you want?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yantar_way_dialog_2"><text>Yeah, they're like that... Not from Voronin. He has a deputy for grub. Says he wants to make a deal with you about supplies...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yantar_way_dialog_3"><text>Ah, that one. What's his name... Anyway, I understand who you're talking about. Well... In principle, we're not against it. They, these DUTY guys, are also kind of hunters, also cleanse the Zone. In their own way though. If he offers something worthwhile, we agree. I think we can feed 50 mouths or even more...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yantar_way_dialog_4"><text>He's asking for samples. For testing it seems...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yantar_way_dialog_51"><text>Oh my! Let's be honest, friend Marked One. You're of course a good guy and all that, but put yourself in my place - someone comes, says they're from someone, and asks for our goods... A word won't fill the stomach, right?\nI can put together a box of samples, but not for free. We could use more flesh eyes right now. Collect half a dozen and then we shake hands. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yantar_way_dialog_52"><text>Oh my! Let's be honest, friend Marked One. You're of course a good guy and all that, but put yourself in my place - someone comes, says they're from someone, and asks for our goods... A word won't fill the stomach, right?\nI can put together a box of samples, but not for free. We could use more pseudodog tails right now. Collect half a dozen and then we shake hands. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yantar_way_dialog_53"><text>Oh my! Let's be honest, friend Marked One. You're of course a good guy and all that, but put yourself in my place - someone comes, says they're from someone, and asks for our goods...

<string id="dar_greens_yantar_way_dialog_6"><text>Half a dozen - that's nothing...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_yantar_way_dialog_7"><text>We'll see, we'll see...</text></string>

<string id="dar_greens_freedom_food_dialog_0"><text>So, people here are interested in your sausage.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_freedom_food_dialog_1"><text>You bet! Sausage is flying off the shelves. We supply the Duty guys, stalkers also buy it often. Even surprisingly so. Sausage business, damn...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_freedom_food_dialog_2"><text>Well why not? Sausage doesn't spoil. Stinks though, and the taste... But we eat it. So here's another gang that's dug in almost at the Zone center - they want to get these delicacies of yours.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_freedom_food_dialog_3"><text>Gang? You're being mysterious, friend Marked One. Who are you planning to feed?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_freedom_food_dialog_4"><text>Heard of the Freedom guys? They want to live in peace with the Zone, but they gotta eat something. So they asked me to scout - would you agree to throw them your delicacies from time to time?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_freedom_food_dialog_5"><text>What will they pay with? Here's the deal. Money in the morning - chair in the evening... well, sausage. Payment - artifacts or hard currency. Say, equivalent to two of those Baku ones for a batch of fifty sausages. Yes means yes, well and no - you understand.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_freedom_food_dialog_6"><text>I'll pass on the terms...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_freedom_food_dialog_7"><text>Pass them on, pass them on...</text></string>

<string id="dar_greens_freedom_food2_dialog_4"><text>Alright, be seeing you...</text></string>

<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_0"><text>Want to get some of your sausage.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_1"><text>What do you have for us? Blind dog tails, boar hooves or something else?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_11"><text>Sorry, friend. We collected an order. Nothing left in small amounts. Come by tomorrow, maybe there'll be something...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_8"><text>I see. Too bad.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_21"><text>Here, got this from a blind dog.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_22"><text>Boar legs? Well here.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_23"><text>Pseudodog tail, will you take it?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_231"><text>Cat tail work?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_24"><text>Got an almost whole flesh eye.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_25"><text>Got bloodsucker tentacles, here.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_26"><text>Chopped off a burer's hand.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_27"><text>Pseudogiant got caught, here's his hand.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_28"><text>Controller tried to grab me. Left without a hand.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_29"><text>Will you take chimera claws?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_291"><text>Got a poltergeist eye, need it?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_292"><text>Here's flesh skin, you taking it?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_293"><text>Snork got what was coming, got his foot, will it work?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_41"><text>Don't you need tushkano heads?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_31"><text>For this - a sausage wheel...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_32"><text>Good job, take the sausage...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_33"><text>Pseudodog will pull a couple sausage wheels...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_331"><text>We don't really need those, can trade for one sausage.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_34"><text>Flesh eye? Whole? Worth three sausages...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_35"><text>Killed a bloodsucker? Take five sausages!</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_36"><text>Found a burer? Haven't seen them for a while... Five sausage rolls for you!</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_37"><text>Managed to kill a giant? Take five sausages!</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_38"><text>For the controller here's some sausages!</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_39"><text>Chimera - what a contagion! Take three sausages, I think we'll find use for these claws...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_391"><text>Poltergeist - rare creature. Take five sausages...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_392"><text>Flesh skin? You convinced me. Here's three sausages...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_393"><text>Snork is quite the creature. Here's three sausages...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_2"><text>Don't have any now, they all went bad, had to throw them out.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_3"><text>Sorry, won't give them for free...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_51"><text>Ah this stuff...\nThough we distill killer moonshine from them. Clear head, butterflies flying in your eyes... And such girls appear next to you...\nAlright. Let me see your heads, if they'll do - I'll trade for a sausage ring...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_61"><text>Here, got some tushkano heads...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_kolbasa_7"><text>Take fresh sausage. Almost no smell...</text></string>

<string id="dar_greens_not_kolbasa_0"><text>Want to get some of your sausage.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_not_kolbasa_1"><text>Come by in the morning. Maybe there'll be sausage for you.</text></string>

<string id="dsc_green_krysyk_dialog_0"><text>I'm looking for one guy here... Rat. Haven't heard of such?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_green_krysyk_dialog_1"><text>No... haven't heard. From the stalkers?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_green_krysyk_dialog_2"><text>How to put it... He had some business with Borov's guys in the Dark Valley.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_green_krysyk_dialog_3"><text>A bandit, huh? Someone came by here the other day, bought sausage from us. Face - definitely bandit. Kept looking around, watching for someone or afraid of something - can't tell. Eyes just darting back and forth, a real rat...</text></string>
<string id="dsc_green_krysyk_dialog_4"><text>Where did he go?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_green_krysyk_dialog_5"><text>How would I know, I didn't follow him... The guys were passing by the gas station, they say smoke was drifting from somewhere near the rubble, like someone was lighting a fire. But none of ours were there for sure, so maybe that's where your rat dug in.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_green_krysyk_dialog_6"><text>Alright, I'll check there.</text></string>

<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_0"><text>I was told that extraordinary cloaks can be made from flesh skin?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_1"><text>Well. Not so extraordinary. Just the pigs mutated so that their skins became very good at protecting from sharp penetrations. Like molecular armor. But cuts easily with a knife. And very tear-resistant. A backpack from it allows carrying heavy weight.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_2"><text>How would I get such? A cloak, I mean...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_3"><text>Ha. Need to kill a couple adult flesh. Don't ruin the skin. Then tan the obtained hides. Then find a master who will give these hides the needed properties and cobble together a cloak.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_4"><text>What? How do you tan? And what master?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_5"><text>What-what... That... You planning to skin raw hide off flesh and put it on yourself? Then they'll mistake you for flesh yourself and start hunting. The hide needs to be processed so it dries, hardens... And our conditions, you understand, aren't industrial. Takes a month, maybe two to give raw hide marketable appearance... And the master. Well there's Stepanych, appears sometimes at the Forgotten Farmstead. There are a couple other people, but they're on the mainland, far away...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_6"><text>So maybe you already have processed hides? I'm not taking them for free...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_7"><text>Yeah obviously not for free. For hides from stalkers we take medical supplies. Med kits, anti-rads... Only if you want to get a ready one, you'll have to bring a couple raw hides from flesh. And if you want special processing hide, extra-strong and light, then you also need three liters of sulfuric acid and a bag of salt... We don't have enough of that for tanning. The rest we have for now.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_8"><text>Where to get that?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_9"><text>That's your problem. Order from the mainland... You need it, make deals with traders or someone else yourself.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_101"><text>Nah... So much hassle with these hides. Don't need it...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_102"><text>Well, suppose I find acid and salt, where are these special flesh? Or can you take from any, flesh is flesh everywhere, what's the difference?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_11"><text>Too smart? Fish is also fish everywhere, but they salt exclusively spawning ones... And these flesh who the hell knows. You need good leather with special properties... And such can only be gotten from mature piglets. Our tracker, One-Eyed Vanka, just spotted several such. Not far from here, northwest of the Manor.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_1_dialog_12"><text>The regional committee dacha? Alright, I'll try.</text></string>

<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_0"><text>I'm here about hides for good gear.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_11"><text>Don't have ready ones yet. I told you - we ran out of salt. And acid too.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_12"><text>Don't have ready ones yet. You brought acid, but no salt.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_13"><text>Don't have ready ones yet. No acid.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_21"><text>Here, brought salt, quite the weight...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_22"><text>Managed to get acid. A whole three-liter jar.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_23"><text>Already have both salt and acid! Here.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_24"><text>I thought maybe you already have some.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_31"><text>Wow! A whole bag! Now it'll last a long time. If only we had acid...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_41"><text>There'll be acid too.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_32"><text>Jar of acid. Should last a couple months... And salt?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_42"><text>I'll find it - bring it.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_33"><text>Excellent. When there are fresh hides - bring them, we'll process them. And ready ones can be spared now. Saved several here for a rainy day, so you don't have to wait for raw ones to be ready. I'll trade raw hide immediately for ready one, for medical supplies.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_43"><text>How much and what do I need for a processed hide?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_5"><text>Well... Depends what you have. If standard med kits, I'll take eight pieces. If army ones, five will be enough. Get scientific ones, only three will do. Yeah, also need anti-rads. I'll trade a hide for ten of those. That's just for the work, for processing that is. The hide itself, I think you'll get?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_6"><text>I'll get it somehow. I'll come back.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_7"><text>Don't rush, Marked One. I owe you. Choose - there's a good knife, hunting one, or I can offer an artifact - saves from hunger, especially when zombies are nearby. Oh, almost forgot, I can also offer a short-barrel shotgun "MP-153" - kills any vermin at close range in one shot. Only need to fix it up a bit, haven't used it for a while.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_71"><text>If the knife isn't made of tin, I'll take it.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_72"><text>Give me your artifact, tired of hauling a bunch of cans on my back. Easy to throw out my back.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_73"><text>Kills vermin in one shot up close, you say? Then I'll take the shotgun.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_81"><text>You offend me, we use the same ones ourselves. You won't regret it.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_82"><text>Rare specimen. Called "Pizza". You won't regret it.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_2_dialog_83"><text>Excellent choice. As a hunter I tell you: you won't regret it!</text></string>

<string id="dar_greens_shkura_3_dialog_0"><text>I need processed flesh leather.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_3_dialog_1"><text>You came to the right place. Give me your hide and for processing, if you remember, a bit of medicine: eight standard med kits or five army ones. If you have scientific ones, we'll deal on three. We also accept anti-rads as payment. Need ten of those.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_3_dialog_21"><text>Got regular med kits.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_3_dialog_22"><text>Just collected army ones.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_3_dialog_23"><text>Take the scientific ones.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_3_dialog_24"><text>Got some anti-rads here.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_3_dialog_25"><text>I don't have that much...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_3_dialog_3"><text>Order. Everything's in order. And you don't even need to wait - there's a small stock of ready hides. Take it.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_shkura_3_dialog_4"><text>Yeah, thanks.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_0"><text>I need salt. And acid. Do you have any?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_1"><text>Got a craving for salty stuff? You watch yourself... the guys here are cunning, you never know... Heh-heh.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_2"><text>Funny to him... I need a whole bag. Got that much?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_3"><text>A bag? You know how much a bag of salt weighs, especially if it's damp? How will you drag it and where? Though, not my concern... Wait, let me remember... Someone already ordered it from me, I even dragged it to the storage with food, less moisture there. Been lying there for a long time, probably hardened already. If they didn't come on time, then you take it, and I didn't even know where to offload it. Give me a couple simple artifacts, or one better one, and drag it wherever you want.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_41"><text>Got two simple artifacts. Give me the bag.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_42"><text>Got one, but better. Give me the bag.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_43"><text>I'll bring them soon. Don't sell to anyone!</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_51"><text>You're messing with the old man... Take the little bag. Don't drop it on your foot, the salt's become like stone...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_52"><text>Yeah, hurry up, I got a line for salt... Heh-heh.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_6"><text>Do you have acid? I need about three liters.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_7"><text>What are you cooking up, homemade explosives? Where would I get acid for you.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_8"><text>I need it... Maybe you can order some?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_9"><text>I don't have such supplies. I know the military guys had a battery guy, well there for BTRs, charges old batteries for machines. Ask Kuznetsov, or maybe someone else deals in military supplies. They don't need much, you know what they like.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_1_dialog_10"><text>Exactly!</text></string>

<string id="sidor_shkura_2_dialog_0"><text>I'm here about salt.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_2_dialog_1"><text>What kind of "about"? Got artifacts? Give them. Don't have? Then no conversation...</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_2_dialog_21"><text>Got a couple simple artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_2_dialog_22"><text>Got one, better quality.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_2_dialog_23"><text>Still thinking.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_shkura_2_dialog_3"><text>Well good. Take the bag. Don't drop it on your foot, the salt's become like stone.</text></string>
<string id="tex_sidor_shkura"><text>Sidorovich offers to sell him a bag of salt for a couple first-level artifacts or one second-level</text></string>

<string id="kuznezov_shkura_1_dialog_0"><text>Listen, can you get acid?</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_1_dialog_11"><text>What kind of acid? What do you need it for?</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_1_dialog_12"><text>You still haven't brought me vodka for the anniversary, though you promised, and you're already pestering me with your requests.</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_1_dialog_21"><text>Regular, sulfuric. You guys probably have some motor pool? Where they fill batteries for equipment?</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_1_dialog_22"><text>Really... that's not good. Wait a bit more, soldier, I'll bring it soon.</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_1_dialog_3"><text>Ah! Well yeah, there is. A soldier watches the equipment. Need much? For a jar, probably five bottles will be enough. Can you find them?</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_1_dialog_41"><text>That's nothing, take them.</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_1_dialog_42"><text>Don't have them with me.</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_1_dialog_51"><text>Good then. I'll tell the soldiers. Come back in an hour. You'll have your jar of acid.</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_1_dialog_52"><text>Then bring them. When you bring them, then we'll talk.</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_1_dialog_6"><text>Alright...</text></string>

<string id="kuznezov_shkura_2_dialog_0"><text>I'm here about acid, remember?</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_2_dialog_1"><text>I remember, my head didn't get knocked off, like some... Just kidding. Did you bring vodka?</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_2_dialog_21"><text>That's nothing, take them.</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_2_dialog_22"><text>Don't have them with me.</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_2_dialog_31"><text>Good then. I'll tell the soldiers. Come back in an hour. You'll have your jar of acid.</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_2_dialog_32"><text>Then why start the conversation? Bring them. When you bring them, then we'll discuss everything.</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_2_dialog_4"><text>Deal.</text></string>

<string id="kuznezov_shkura_done_0"><text>Did you bring the acid?</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_done_11"><text>You're quite hasty. I said in an hour. Go take a walk.</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_done_12"><text>Here's your acid. Take it, don't spill it.</text></string>
<string id="kuznezov_shkura_done_2"><text>Got it.</text></string>
<string id="tex_kuznezov_shkura"><text>For five bottles of vodka Kuznetsov promises to get a jar of acid</text></string>

<string id="stepanych_shkura_start_dialog_0"><text>Stepanych, is it about you they say that you're a master at making leather cloaks?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_shkura_start_dialog_1"><text>Well, master or not master... There's a little skill. If only the material was good...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_shkura_start_dialog_2"><text>Do you make new ones? Or only repair old ones?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_shkura_start_dialog_3"><text>Different ways. I can make a new one, and patch up what's there. And modify a little. Well... reduce weight, strengthen, or make it so you can lift more weight. Something like that. Of course, not for free...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_shkura_start_dialog_4"><text>Well, not for free, that's understandable. What exactly is needed?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_shkura_start_dialog_5"><text>Look yourself: just patching I can do for free - well you respect the old man, throw some money and good. But to sew a new cloak or improve the one that's there... For that also need animal skin, and my ingredients that you don't need to know. And a good artifact, no lower than second level for the work...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_shkura_start_dialog_6"><text>Skins, then. From animals. Understood. If needed, I'll come back.</text></string>

<string id="stepanych_plash_new_start_dialog_0"><text>Want to order a cloak, here's a skin.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_plash_new_start_dialog_1"><text>Well yes, well yes. Good skin, yeah. How many of these do you have? For a simple cloak need a couple pieces, well and to make a good thing - no less than four...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_plash_new_start_dialog_21"><text>Got a couple. Let's do a simple cloak.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_plash_new_start_dialog_22"><text>I want a good one, strong. Here's more skins.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_plash_new_start_dialog_23"><text>Uh... I think I'll think about it.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_plash_new_start_dialog_31"><text>Well then, good. Prepare a good artifact for payment - no lower than second level. By tomorrow, maybe, I'll manage. So you rest for now...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_plash_new_start_dialog_32"><text>A good person needs a good thing, that's right. For a good thing also good payment - an artifact. And no lower than third level. You rest for now, gather strength. In a couple days I'll manage, I think, if I stay alive.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_plash_new_start_dialog_33"><text>So think, think, drink some tea. It thinks better then...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_plash_new_start_dialog_41"><text>Alright, I'll rest. Yes! Maybe we can also carefully build in a gas mask?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_plash_new_start_dialog_42"><text>Well alright, fine. I'll come back when it's ready.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_plash_new_start_dialog_5"><text>Well it's possible, why not!? Throw in one more good artifact on top and you'll have a cloak with gas mask. Or won't you change your mind? We work and work, and then...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_plash_new_start_dialog_6"><text>Don't doubt it. If I said it, then I did it...</text></string>

<string id="stepanych_1plash_new_done_dialog_0"><text>Well, is the cloak ready?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_1plash_new_done_dialog_11"><text>I did my work. Cloak is something else, look, you can't even see the seams, everything seems to have grown together... Well? How about payment? Second level artifact. Do you have it?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_1plash_new_done_dialog_12"><text>Cloak is ready, look, you can't even see the seams, everything seems to have grown together... And gas mask... Not a single extra hole. Right? How about what's honestly earned? One artifact - for the cloak, second - for the gas mask. Together - two second level artifacts. Do you have them?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_1plash_new_done_dialog_21"><text>Yes, of course, I remember. Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_1plash_new_done_dialog_22"><text>Yes, of course, I remember. Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_1plash_new_done_dialog_23"><text>I left the artifacts in a stash. I'll run get them now.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_1plash_new_done_dialog_3"><text>Well... You respected the old man. Here's your new gear.</text></string>

<string id="stepanych_2plash_new_done_dialog_0"><text>Well, is the cloak ready?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_2plash_new_done_dialog_11"><text>I did my work. Cloak is something else, look, you can't even see the seams, everything seems to have grown together... Well? How about payment? Third level artifact. Do you have it?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_2plash_new_done_dialog_12"><text>Cloak is ready, look, you can't even see the seams, everything seems to have grown together... And gas mask... Not a single extra hole. Right? How about what's honestly earned? One artifact - for the cloak, second - for the gas mask. Together - two artifacts. Third and second level. Do you have them?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_2plash_new_done_dialog_21"><text>Yes, of course, I remember. Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_2plash_new_done_dialog_22"><text>Yes, of course, I remember. Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_2plash_new_done_dialog_23"><text>I left the artifacts in a stash. I'll run get them now.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_2plash_new_done_dialog_3"><text>Well... You respected the old man. Here's your new gear.</text></string>

<string id="stepanych_repair_dialog_0"><text>Maybe... Listen, look at this cloak...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_dialog_1"><text>Come on, turn around... Hmm...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_dialog_12"><text>You wait! I haven't finished that one yet...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_dialog_13"><text>Well... Alright. Finish it.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_dialog_2"><text>Well? Will you do it?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_dialog_31"><text>Why not? Can try. You better pour some vodka to grease the process...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_list_trader_repair_6"><text>And I think you'll find something for the work.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_dialog_32"><text>Hmm... Well... No, won't take it. Too torn up already. Easier to make a new one than bring this to decent appearance. You're out of luck.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_dialog_42"><text>Yeah. Shame. Should I throw it away...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_dialog_411"><text>Alright, here you go...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_dialog_412"><text>Don't have any right now...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_dialog_5"><text>Oh! You respected the old man. You go - lie down a bit, you look bad. Completely tired. And I'll work on this slowly.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_dialog_6"><text>Alright, alright, work...</text></string>

<string id="stepanych_repair_end_dialog_0"><text>Well how's my cloak?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_end_dialog_1"><text>Here it is, look. Of course not like new, but the structure is whole. Can wear it like before. And protection is good. Take it.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_end_dialog_11"><text>You wait! Where are you rushing to. Not ready yet...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_end_dialog_2"><text>Hmm, yes. Seems like the seams aren't visible.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_repair_end_dialog_12"><text>I'm not rushing! Work...</text></string>

<string id="dar_greens_part_exchange_dialog_0"><text>Maybe you'll sell some monster parts?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_part_exchange_dialog_1"><text>Well... No. Monsters are dangerous and to give away what's obtained with difficulty through hunting, for those rubles that stalkers can offer... No, not worth it to us.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_part_exchange_dialog_2"><text>No options?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_part_exchange_dialog_3"><text>You go talk to our Prosha. He sometimes accumulates some parts, but lacks others. Maybe he'll trade some for others...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_part_exchange_dialog_4"><text>Who's Prosha?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_part_exchange_dialog_51"><text>Axe virtuoso... Our butcher. There he is...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_part_exchange_dialog_52"><text>Axe virtuoso... Our butcher. He's sleeping it off now, come back later...</text></string>

<string id="dar_greens_part_exchange_2dialog_0"><text>Where's Prosha, your axe virtuoso?</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_part_exchange_2dialog_1"><text>He sleeps it off in the mornings, come in the afternoon.</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_part_exchange_2dialog_2"><text>Where? I urgently need him...</text></string>
<string id="dar_greens_part_exchange_2dialog_3"><text>I told you - the man is resting! Who cares what someone needs. When the sun shines in the treetops - then come.</text></string>

<string id="dsc_ignat_rnd_mutant_part_100"><text>Nothing special, though...</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_rnd_mutant_part_110"><text>I have everything needed, take it.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_rnd_mutant_part_120"><text>I'll keep it in mind...</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_rnd_mutant_part_111"><text>Excellent! How to thank you? Will you take money or gear?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_rnd_mutant_part_1000"><text>Give me the material stuff you were offering... money for life is enough anyway.</text></string>

<string id="dsc_ignat_rnd_mutant_part_200"><text>Yeah everything's as usual.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_rnd_mutant_part_201"><text>Alright, won't distract you. I'll drop by again sometime, we'll chat.</text></string>
<!-- Script inserts for monster carcasses -->
<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_tushkano"><text>Did you hear that from tushkano brains you can make an amazing brew? No fatigue, brain works like a computer, you barely feel pain... And even, well I don't really believe it, they say the ability to move objects at a distance appears! Hmm... We want to test these rumors... Will you help? Need just nothing - collect ten tushkano heads... And for this I'll give you loot:</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_dog"><text>Soon we have a big feast planned, and some local gourmets - won't point fingers - will definitely want to try my signature dish - dog tails in pork sauce. Anyway, lots of people, need about ten pieces... Why are you dropping your jaw? Think, what do we need so many for? Alright, agreed, eight will be enough.\nFrom me you can get:</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_boar"><text>Here are boar hooves, seems like nobody really needs them, but there's demand for them too. Some want them as a talisman, others make tinctures, third ones... don't even want to say! But they pay... So if you cut up many, bring them! But one by one makes no sense for me to collect them, they'll just stink here... Anyway, need half a dozen at once, and fresh ones - then the payment will be worthy:</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_zombie"><text>Local dealers who try to engage in racketeering are eager for all kinds of tales about miraculous properties of monster guts. One was here recently, telling that supposedly from zombie hands organisms stop aging. Don't know if it's true or bullshit... If you don't mind, get five hands of these monsters.\nI'll thank you if anything. Can offer:</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_cat"><text>Listen, Marked One, you're not afraid of cats? There's one job. I was talking here with our researchers - they can't figure out their secrets. They tried this way and that - but nothing works. So they decided to go another way - the method of Protivny, heard of such? Famous scientist was, they say... Like, if the problem doesn't give from the head, try from the end. And don't grin, talking about the end of the body, the tail that is, and not what you thought. Five cat tails will be enough for them to start.\nAs reward I can offer:</text></string>

<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_flesh"><text>Listen, how timely you showed up, Marked One! There's one job - oh, interesting! You imagine what our eggheads dug up - you've seen the local swine many times... well, this flesh. So it turns out, in its eye - these... smell recipes, got it?! Or not?! Receptors - like that, maybe? Anyway! They don't just look with them, they also smell with them - with their peepers! Look what wonders are here, turns out! So a scientific idea appeared: try a transplant, conduct "transportation", so to speak. Or again not right... Translocation... Yes, exactly! Translocation, means... And for this experiment need several fresh organs - eyes, I mean. Supposedly will implant them in dogs, we have enough of that "good stuff", but no eyes. Graduate students are only strong in the scientific part in the swamps, but to kill flesh and not damage its peepers - they can't. And they won't be allowed... Well, will you help our eggheads?\nYou're an experienced stalker, what's it to you to dig out four little eyes? No... better bring five, one for backup, in case they mess something up. And I'll find something to thank you with:</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_psevdodog"><text>Marked One, among rich boys who haven't smelled the Zone, a new fashion has spread - they wear pseudodog tails, supposedly these tails increase potency and all that... In short, I have constant demand for them, will you take on getting them? To replenish the ordered batch I need five more pieces. Just look carefully: so the fur isn't too worn and doesn't radiate. Then you'll get as reward:</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_snork"><text>Biologists from one company are interested in researching the Zone's impact on people. As source material they take snork parts. If you have need for some equipment or money, try to carefully shoot snorks so you don't damage the needed parts. Well you understand, with one I have nothing to do, what if there won't be others? For one piece I won't send a courier running. So let's do this: you get me at least four pieces, then I'll pay accordingly:</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_chimera"><text>Chimera claws were ordered from me, don't know why, they don't say. They paid a deposit... I threw out a call to my guys - already a couple people are working on this issue. How about you, will you participate? Only need three more pieces, and I'll thank you:</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_burer"><text>One middleman, a foreigner, asked me to get him three burer hands, he pays well for them. Says it's for a private collection. Supposedly all Zone spawn are represented there, whatever exists. From whoever - what, to be exact, because taking out the whole giant, for example, or controller to the mainland isn't so easy. Anyway, that collection is only missing burer parts... For guarantee exactly three pieces are required, in case something rots completely on the way.\nIf you're interested, look what you can get as reward:</text></string>

<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_krovosos"><text>Soon it's Prosha's birthday... Eh, we'll party gloriously! I found out a recipe for one dish from the Barman by chance - bloodsucker tentacles in pork sauce. Want to delight the old friend with a new culinary masterpiece. Dog tails in pork sauce have gotten old for everyone. Anyway, I need the tentacles of this creature - three should be enough...\nFrom me you can get:</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_kontroler"><text>Eh, Marked One... there's one job, but dangerous - I really don't know. Very respectable people from a very serious office approached me. Couldn't refuse them. From the talks I understood that their leadership got one crazy idea... don't even want to talk about it... damn psychics. Anyway, find a controller and chop off its hand... Well or cut it off, you have a knife?\nBring it - you'll get:</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_psevdogigant"><text>Eggheads want to study monsters, but are afraid to go into the Zone... They ordered from me here, for genetic research, to get a pseudogiant... whole! Simpletons. Anyway I explained that his carcass can't be dragged out of here for any money. So they agreed to any part. They promised worthy payment, so I can offer something to whoever completes this task:</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_poltergeist"><text>I heard that in the laboratory, the one in Dark Valley, these very... poltergeists dwell. I have one brainy acquaintance from the scientific brotherhood. So I want to make him a gift. He's long been interested in the possibility of researching telekineti... what they call... Monster abilities, in general. Look, almost broke my tongue. In short... Try to get these damn poltergeist eyes, by rumors, all their power is in them. And let them dissect, study there. Good for us and scientific interest for him.\nIf you please me with a pair of eyes, then from me:</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ignat_generate_chimera_kidney"><text>Our scientist comrades have long been trying to understand: how does the electrochimera generate such a strong discharge. They suspect that the kidneys are that very "generator". Get one for experiments - there will be gratitude from the scientific brotherhood and from us!\nAnd this gratitude will be expressed in material form:</text></string>

<string id="nazar_start_dialog_101"><text>Hey, man. Haven't we met before? Something about your look seems familiar to me...</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_102"><text>I don't remember. Don't remember - who I am and where I'm from.</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_103"><text>Well you're something! How should I address you, Ivan-no-memory?</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_104"><text>Marked One. That's what they call me.</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_105"><text>Hold on there, Marked One. What brings you to our Guts? Not many artifacts here, but plenty of dogs... can feed yourself any moment. Heh-heh.</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_106"><text>Yeah I saw. Real herds. And I'm here on business. My own. What are you guys doing here?</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_107"><text>Don't want to talk, no need. And we have nothing to hide. We herd beasts. Get all kinds of stuff. Hunt, in general. I teach stalkers how to become real hunters. Maybe someone will be useful. In time.</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_108"><text>I see. I'll move on.</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_109"><text>Be seeing you, familiar stranger.</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_201"><text>Decided to hunt or just visiting?</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_2021"><text>I'm here on business, on business.</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_2022"><text>I'm looking for one person. Called Vaska. He should have passed through these parts recently. He's got a distinctive rifle - TOZ-66. Haven't met him?</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_203"><text>Hmm... If it's the one you're talking about, then yes, I saw a stalker with such a rifle, he came from the Cordon. Cheerful guy, exchanged a couple phrases, and that was it.</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_204"><text>Did he happen to mention where he was planning to go?</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_205"><text>Yeah seemed like he wanted to swing by the sawmill, stock up on sausage for the road. Ask our guys there, maybe they'll tell you more precisely.</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_206"><text>Got it, understood, thanks.</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_251"><text>Greetings to you. How are we living?</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_252"><text>Slowly. You guys just sit here all the time? When do you hunt?</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_253"><text>Hunting is serious business. Doesn't tolerate haste.</text></string>
<string id="nazar_start_dialog_301"><text>Always running around. Sit down, rest.</text></string>

<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_dialog_101"><text>Greetings. Are you here on business? Petrov is my surname, and you are?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_dialog_102"><text>I don't remember. I don't remember - who I am or where I'm from. They've been calling me the Marked One for now.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_dialog_103"><text>Hmm. Consequences of trauma? Or psionic influence? Well yes, yes... You can't remember, of course. My colleagues and I once had quite a heated debate about how a person's informational essence cannot simply vanish without a trace. Have you heard of Vernadsky's noosphere? Although... I apologize once again...</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_dialog_104"><text>Well, alright. And what do you mean - cannot disappear? This interests me greatly, as you can understand...</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_dialog_105"><text>Well, there exists a theory that all information is some kind of matter that doesn't come from nowhere and doesn't disappear into nothing, but merely redistributes itself. Perhaps there are ways to tap into the general information field and obtain information bypassing intermediaries. There's even been a hypothesis put forward, not by me, that the so-called Monolith, which rumor has it is located somewhere in the central area of the Zone currently inaccessible to people, is actually some kind of access terminal to this noosphere.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_dialog_106"><text>And what does that mean?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_dialog_107"><text>In theory, an individual who makes contact with the noo-terminal would be able to gain knowledge about practically everything... But this theory is too radical and doesn't withstand any serious criticism. Although... there's something to it.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_dialog_108"><text>I see that nothing is clear. So it turns out that if I get to this Monolith, I'll be able to find out who I am?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_dialog_109"><text>Well, if we approach it with a considerable dose of optimism, then yes, possibly...</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_dialog_201"><text>Greetings. Are you visiting us again?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_dialog_202"><text>Yes, thought I'd drop by to say hello...</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_dialog_203"><text>Then greetings once more... Glad you stopped by, new people are scarce around here. Though that's good for research purposes.</text></string>

<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_x16_dialog_0"><text>I'm interested in the laboratory at Yantar.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_x16_dialog_1"><text>Hmm, the one that Vasiliev was searching for? As far as I know, there hasn't been any reliable information yet. Or has there?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_x16_dialog_2"><text>As Sakharov said, Vasiliev with guides managed to penetrate that very laboratory. Just not clear how. Ivan Sergeevich speaks vaguely about something. Well, do you know anything?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_x16_dialog_3"><text>In his last message, Vasiliev mentioned that a certain stalker with the strange alias - Ghost - told him something. Something about the existence of a method for instant controlled transport through space, and possibly time. But for this, simultaneous activation of three unique artifacts is necessary. As an example, a scheme was given for teleportation two-three meters in the direction toward the center of the earth. In my opinion - very, very dangerous experiments...</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_x16_dialog_4"><text>Dangerous, that's for sure. And what artifacts? Didn't he mention them?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_x16_dialog_5"><text>In that example there was reference to artifacts of the so-called "emerald" group. "Twisted," "Jellyfish" and "Stone Blood." To verify this hypothesis probably won't be possible - these artifacts are far too rare.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_x16_dialog_6"><text>Probably it was still possible, since Vasiliev and those who were with him managed to get into that mysterious underground laboratory... And where is it located? The specific place?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_x16_dialog_7"><text>Hmm... Vasiliev was certain he knew. Even marked it on the map. Right here, in the basement of this building at the Yantar factory. Mark it down for yourself if you're interested.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_x16_dialog_8"><text>In the basement? And you're saying another two-three meters toward the center of the Earth, where could it go even deeper? And how to use these "emeralds," Vasiliev didn't say? Maybe throw them on the ground or arrange in a triangle? I don't understand...</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_x16_dialog_9"><text>I think we shouldn't engage in magic and build triangles out of artifacts. Vasiliev didn't say, but I suppose not because he was hiding it, but because the method of application is somehow simple, obvious... You see, stalkers use homemade belts for carrying artifacts, even though they don't even understand what this might lead to. Well, try hanging them on your belt then. Only I don't advise mindlessly experimenting with such dangerous things. If you do decide to do it, then only at the indicated point, or God knows where you might end up.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_x16_dialog_10"><text>Yes, dangerous, of course. But we need to check. "Emerald" artifacts, then... three pieces. Hmm, that means we need a belt for three artifacts too... We'll be searching.</text></string>

<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_tele_dialog_0"><text>You were telling me something about the Monolith. Noosphere this, noosphere that...</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_tele_dialog_1"><text>So. And what?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_tele_dialog_2"><text>Well, nothing... Some interesting notes came my way, so I thought, maybe it could be that thoughts can flow from one person to another? Like be transmitted by teleport...</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_tele_dialog_3"><text>Interesting view on teleportation... However, if we consider that thought could theoretically have some mass, even if insignificant, then why not teleport it through space... From point A to point B. Only what should we consider the starting and ending point? After all, we don't know where exactly and how thought is born. But interesting approach. And what does the Monolith have to do with this?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_tele_dialog_4"><text>Just like that, came up in conversation. You were saying something about the noosphere, information field or whatever... About the Monolith. So there you go.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_tele_dialog_5"><text>Yes-yes, I remember, and your interest is understandable to me. Unfortunately, I can't reassure you with anything... And regarding teleportation and the so-called Monolith, you know, there's one bold hypothesis by Academician Kutin. I won't go into details, but the essence of the assumption is this: there's a negligible probability of stumbling upon such a teleport that can transport not only through space, but also through time. And for a physical body located spatially near the Monolith, this probability increases geometrically. The amplitude over time also increases, well that is, it'll throw you further. Perhaps the disturbances near the Monolith itself are such that not only physical objects are teleported, but also thoughts, as you said... why not. These are assumptions, we can neither confirm nor refute them yet.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_tele_dialog_6"><text>Strong disturbances... That means it knocks your brains out there, right?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_tele_dialog_7"><text>I can't assert that, though such a thing is possible. Something must definitely happen to the information field I told you about, and consequently to human consciousness. And as for physical bodies, it's assumed that falling into some field near the Monolith, you could fly off in an unknown direction for hundreds of thousands of kilometers in space and millions of years in time... Theoretically, of course.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_tele_dialog_8"><text>Holy shit, what theories you have... In general, I understood that it's better not to mess with it, or it'll hurl you somewhere - and you won't come back.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_ecolog_glavn_tele_dialog_9"><text>I'm telling you - it's only a hypothesis. And it doesn't have many supporters.</text></string>

<string id="bar_barman_tele_dialog_0"><text>Heard anything about teleports?</text></string>
<string id="bar_barman_tele_dialog_1"><text>Well...</text></string>
<string id="bar_barman_tele_dialog_2"><text>What "well"?</text></string>
<string id="bar_barman_tele_dialog_3"><text>About "Whirligigs" they talk a lot, but that's been known for ages. And they also say there's someone who can somehow create a teleport... Bullshit, in my opinion. Although... Here in the Zone, anything can happen.</text></string>
<string id="bar_barman_tele_dialog_4"><text>Why? Seems possible...</text></string>
<string id="bar_barman_tele_dialog_5"><text>Seems, yeah kind of... One egghead here had too much to drink once, gave such a performance... said you can travel through time in general. What a performer that one was.</text></string>
<string id="bar_barman_tele_dialog_6"><text>But what if... It's the Zone, after all. There are reports about Semetsky. Maybe he got stuck somewhere in a teleport and flies back and forth like that.</text></string>
<string id="bar_barman_tele_dialog_7"><text>And you're going there too? Semetsky - that's just a tale, stalker folklore... Ah, don't rack my brains! Another wise guy to me. Better get down to business.</text></string>

<string id="bar_barman_red_dialog_0"><text>Remember, you were telling me about a stalker who crawled from the Red Forest into the laboratory at Yantar?</text></string>
<string id="bar_barman_red_dialog_1"><text>When was that? Ah... I told you, that's bullshit, in my opinion. Drunk talk. Such bullshitters here - every other one.</text></string>
<string id="bar_barman_red_dialog_2"><text>Bullshit or not - we'll figure it out. And where is this stalker now, do you know?</text></string>
<string id="bar_barman_red_dialog_3"><text>He was here the other day. Looked like he was getting ready for a raid.</text></string>
<string id="bar_barman_red_dialog_4"><text>What's his name?</text></string>
<string id="bar_barman_red_dialog_5"><text>His name... slipped my mind. Ah, here! He and Prut were "buzzing" by the fire past midnight, people complained later that they wouldn't let them sleep. Even wanted to beat the crap out of that pair, but the debt collectors calmed the troublemakers down in time. Try Prut, in general. Though, it seems to me that all this is a dead end. But Sakharov might know something...</text></string>

<string id="mikhalych_change_art_start_dialog_0"><text>You trade artifacts? We had a deal.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_change_art_start_dialog_1"><text>And they said you have a pot instead of a head. Look here - you didn't forget. I trade, I trade - crappy ones for better ones. Let's have a look, what do you have?</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_change_art_start_dialog_2"><text>Let's wait on looking... What do you mean crappy? You explain properly. What specific artifacts do you need. As I understand it, you won't take just anything.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_change_art_start_dialog_3"><text>Oh... look how many questions you have. I thought that if a stalker already made it to Limansk, then he's an experienced person and doesn't need to be told which end of a bottle to hold...\nAlright, listen again.\nArtifacts have different properties. So here's the deal - I give you one artifact, as you say "in the green," and you give me two, but slightly worse ones. Got it, or should I explain again?</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_change_art_start_dialog_4"><text>Ah, well yeah, that's obvious even to a hedgehog.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_change_art_start_dialog_5"><text>What a hedgehog we'll have between us, such will be the arithmetic. Just make sure you bring the same kind - I have my own props and my own nuances for them. And don't make that face - with me everything's by the rules... yes is yes, no is no. Nobody's twisting your arm - if you don't like it, don't trade. Clear?</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_change_art_start_dialog_6"><text>Clear. If I need anything, I'll come to you.</text></string>

<string id="mikhalych_change_art_dialog_0"><text>I'm here about trading artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_change_art_dialog_1"><text>Well, show me - what do you have there? Maybe we'll trade.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_change_art_dialog_21"><text>Here's a couple of simple artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_change_art_dialog_23"><text>Take two medium-class artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_change_art_dialog_24"><text>Here are high-class artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_change_art_dialog_31"><text>Yeah, that'll work - suits for trade. Here, take a good artifact...</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_change_art_dialog_22"><text>Hmm, where did I put them... Wait, I think I had some. Can't find them anywhere.</text></string>
<string id="mikhalych_change_art_dialog_32"><text>Look, look... don't rush. Mikhalych sleeps, money drips... Heh.</text></string>

<string id="lim_lager_bandits_glavn_start_dialog_101"><text>You, uh... Looking for someone? Or just - running past?</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_glavn_start_dialog_102"><text>You could say yes, I'm looking. For Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_glavn_start_dialog_103"><text>Strelok? Nah, nobody like that came through. We're shooters ourselves here. Washing our pants after that business... Boss said we need to move to the town, to the district center. Like there are some guys there we need to have a word with. But can't get further - lightning strikes. Over there our buddy, Crucian, got zapped so bad - only ash left. Who are you anyway?</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_glavn_start_dialog_104"><text>Marked One. Lightning, you say. Alright. We'll see.</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_glavn_start_dialog_201"><text>Washed your pants? Shooter... Heh-heh...</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_bandits_glavn_start_dialog_202"><text>Should check your own, talking nonsense...</text></string>

<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_0"><text>I'd like to add more slots for artifacts on my belt.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_1"><text>Well, that's possible. What do you have available?</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_21"><text>For one artifact.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_22"><text>I have a belt for two artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_23"><text>Got one for three artifacts here.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_24"><text>I have one for four artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_25"><text>I changed my mind, don't need anything.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_31"><text>Hmm. One stalker left me a two-slot one here. I can let you have it, and I'll gradually improve yours. Give me any simple artifact like a jellyfish or twisted - and the belt is yours.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_32"><text>I happen to have a three-slot one. If you give me an artifact no lower than second level, I'll give it to you. And I'll work on your belt.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_33"><text>Actually, I need to reassemble the entire voltage multiplier circuit. But I have one ready for four discharge units. If you don't mind parting with a third-level artifact, I'll replace it for you in no time.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_34"><text>Four to five? Isn't that a bit much? You'll look like a Christmas tree... Well, your business. For five discharge units I need very powerful thyristor assemblies. I have them, of course, but... In short, for less than an Empty-class artifact, I won't part with them. Agreed?</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_41"><text>Alright, I agree. Take the artifact.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_42"><text>Second level? Well, alright.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_43"><text>What an appetite you have! Alright.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_44"><text>An Empty! Holy crap! Where is the world heading! Agreed!</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_45"><text>I'll think about it some more...</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_51"><text>Here you go. Belt for two artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_52"><text>Good, here you go. For three artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_53"><text>Let me install it. Here, additional slot... Done, take it...</text></string>
<string id="docent_upgrade_belt_54"><text>Well, you judge for yourself - where would I get new ones now? Only by order. And that's time and big expenses. Take this one, be more careful.</text></string>

<string id="docent_self_pda_done_dialog_0"><text>How's my little device doing?</text></string>
<string id="docent_self_pda_done_dialog_11"><text>Uh-uh-uh... You're rushing too much. I haven't checked it yet, come back later.</text></string>
<string id="docent_self_pda_done_dialog_12"><text>Yeah, everything seems fine. I cleaned it up a bit... Wiped the contacts with alcohol and all that... Right?</text></string>
<string id="docent_self_pda_done_dialog_2"><text>You... Don't give me that "right". I settled everything with you fair and square. So...</text></string>
<string id="docent_self_pda_done_dialog_3"><text>Alright, just kidding. Here's your PDA. Clean as a whistle. You take care of it, you hear. Just in case...</text></string>
<string id="docent_self_pda_done_dialog_4"><text>What about the money?! There was more there - what, down the drain?</text></string>
<string id="docent_self_pda_done_dialog_5"><text>Money, it's for vitality, like oxygen, you understand... So you can breathe freely there, "where man breathes so freely". It's my little pension fund. So go on, go on your way.</text></string>

<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_101"><text>Hello, Marked One. This man has been sheltering me for now... Have you heard anything new about Vlad?</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_1021"><text>Uh-uh-uh... No, haven't heard anything. You should go home already.</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_1022"><text>I met your husband, told him about you. He immediately rushed here, should show up soon, I think.</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_1023"><text>He's dead, unfortunately.</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_1031"><text>I'll wait. However long it takes...</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_1032"><text>Really? You think soon? Thank you so much!</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_1033"><text>I don't believe it! It can't be... What now...</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_1041"><text>Well, suit yourself, wait.</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_1042"><text>Whatever, no big deal.</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_1043"><text>Go home, Oksana. Otherwise you'll die here too.</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_201"><text>Hello, Marked One. Have you heard anything new about Vlad?</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_301"><text>Hello. Everything alright? Good luck to you!</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_302"><text>Thanks for the kind words.</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_401"><text>How am I supposed to live now...</text></string>
<string id="esc_oksana_start_dialog_402"><text>Like everyone who's lost loved ones... Just live.</text></string>

<string id="esc_vlad_start_dialog_11"><text>Hi there, friend.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vlad_start_dialog_51"><text>Hello. Thanks for helping my wife. She told me how you led her out of Cordon. I don't even know how to thank you... We're getting ready to head back home soon. Hope I can think of something.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vlad_start_dialog_52"><text>Don't mention it, no thanks needed. You're alive and together, that's what matters. And don't go into the Zone anymore. Good luck.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vlad_start_dialog_101"><text>Hi, Marked One. I was just waiting for you. I told Oksana: we can't just leave like that - without thanking this man.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vlad_start_dialog_102"><text>Don't worry about it.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vlad_start_dialog_103"><text>Of course, I can't thank you properly - too much has piled up, but maybe what I saw will be useful to you. When I was walking here through the Gut, I noticed how to the left of the bridge over the swamp, a giant was writhing in agony. Apparently hunters shot it, could barely move. So if you hurry, you can take some good trophies from it. It was lying near a lone birch.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vlad_start_dialog_104"><text>A giant, you say? We'll see.</text></string>
<string id="esc_vlad_start_dialog_201"><text>Hey, how's it going?</text></string>
<string id="esc_vlad_start_dialog_202"><text>Fine...</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_1_101"><text>What's with you, Sanyok, like you don't know me? Grabbed a full bag of loot and, like, I don't know you guys?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_1_102"><text>What are you talking about? You know me?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_1_103"><text>Sanya! What's wrong? Don't I know you? I just don't understand what happened to you?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_1_104"><text>You say Sanya? But I really don't remember you, I swear. They found me recently near a truck, and... that's it, no memories in my head. Are we really acquainted?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_1_105"><text>Found you by a truck?!.. Ahem... Damn! Man, sorry. You look a lot like Sanyok, got confused. Sorry, really.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_1_106"><text>No worries, happens...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_1_201"><text>Ah! It's you, bro... How's it going?</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_2_101"><text>I'm freakin' out! I'm looking at you and you don't want to recognize me? Got rich and full of yourself? Soon as you went north, you disappeared, and now you don't know and don't want to. And we drank so much vodka together...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_2_102"><text>We drank together? When?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_2_103"><text>Well hello, I'm your aunt! Andryukh, what's wrong with you, really? What happened to you?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_2_104"><text>Long story... I lost my memory, don't remember anything about myself, they picked me up near a death truck somewhere, now I'm wandering around... Tell me, where did we meet before. Am I really Andryukha?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_2_105"><text>Uh... Man, are you serious about the truck? Holy shit... I was mistaken, you just look a lot like someone, got confused... And anyway, I don't have time.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_2_106"><text>Mistaken, huh...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_2_201"><text>Hi there, look-alike...</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_3_101"><text>Holy shit! What the hell, pal? Nah... fo' real turnin' your mug away and, like, we don't know each other? I'm crackin' up!..</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_3_102"><text>What are you babbling about? We know each other or what?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_3_103"><text>What? And who carried you on his back with loot from the vortex - Pushkin or what? Nah, Tolyan, I fo' real don't get it, what's the joke?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_3_104"><text>And when was that? A lot has happened since then, I completely lost my memory, they found me recently next to a truck, you know, that death truck. That's the whole deal. So my name's Anatoly?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_3_105"><text>Oh, damn! Wait a sec, let me look at ya... What a moron I am! Been hittin' the bottle and still seeing things! You ain't Tolyan, you just look like him! I'll be damned. Alright, see ya, mister!</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_3_106"><text>Should drink less...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_3_201"><text>Ah! It's you again...</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_4_101"><text>Wait a minute! You're Oleg, right? Remember how we fought off the dogs? You left somewhere after that, I didn't even get to thank you... Thanks, you helped me out.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_4_102"><text>You're welcome... When was that?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_4_103"><text>About three months ago, I got mauled pretty bad then, was lying there like a log. And you don't remember? You look kinda rough, and where did you disappear to then?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_4_104"><text>If only I knew where I've been! Memory got knocked out completely, forgot who I am entirely. Thanks to good people who picked me up by some interesting little truck, now I'm wandering the Zone, trying to remember. So you knew me well?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_4_105"><text>Damn, what bad luck... well, what can you do. I think I only saw you briefly, or maybe it wasn't you at all, just looked similar... Right, not you. Mixed you up.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_4_106"><text>Too bad. Would've been better if it was me...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_4_201"><text>How are you, friend?</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_5_101"><text>Hey there, dude! I'm looking and thinking: is that you or not?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_5_102"><text>It's me alright. And you recognized someone in me?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_5_103"><text>What do you mean "someone"? You're Lyokha, I know you, we went artifact hunting together in one place, come on, did you forget?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_5_104"><text>Forgot. Ever since I got off the death truck, I forgot everything. When was that?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_5_105"><text>Man, you got messed up, really messed up... I've had withdrawals before, but to climb into a truck - no way... Ah! I totally forgot, Lyokha left the Zone a long time ago. What a blockhead I am! Had a drink in the morning, then smoked some, got a bit confused.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_5_106"><text>Yeah... Fun times you have here.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_5_201"><text>How's it going, buddy?</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_6_101"><text>How's life, Petruha?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_6_102"><text>You talking to me?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_6_103"><text>Well, who else? What's wrong, Petruha, don't you recognize me or what?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_6_104"><text>Don't recognize... I have this, like shell shock - lost my memory, after I rode in a truck...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_6_105"><text>A truck?.. Actually I don't know Petruha very well myself, but by description you kinda look like him. Thought if you respond, then you're Petruha... But you're still not Petruha. Sorry, man.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_6_106"><text>So, not Petruha...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_6_201"><text>Well, made a mistake, happens to everyone...</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_7_101"><text>Yo! Look who's here without security! Come on, tell me, how's it going over there?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_7_102"><text>What? You sure you got the right guy?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_7_103"><text>Pal, what's wrong? Or did ya get all high and mighty after grabbing some loot? And who was drinking with Scabby, who was talking about good stuff - wasn't that you?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_7_104"><text>Maybe it was me... When was that? I'm like, after the little truck, when I rolled off it, I don't remember anything.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_7_105"><text>What? Wait, turn around... Ah! Mixed you up, pal. From the front you don't look like him, but from behind - damn similar to some guy, I swear! That's how I mixed you up... Don't even know how, but from behind you look alike...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_7_106"><text>By the back of the head, probably...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_7_201"><text>Ah... by the back of the head, ha! That's a good one!</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_8_101"><text>Oh! Where'd you come from? They buried you...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_8_102"><text>Where? You must not be awake yet, seeing things.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_8_103"><text>Where - you want me to show you the cross or what? And they wrote on it: Here lies Mytyay. Holy shit! You're like a werewolf or some ghoul from the grave...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_8_104"><text>Cool down and wipe your eyes... You say my name is Mytyay? That's from Dmitry, right? Tell me in detail, where's the cross, what happened there. I have this... amnesia, after I got off a truck a couple months ago, like they told me.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_8_105"><text>And I don't give a damn about your amnesia... Wait, what did you say - got off a truck? Ah, so that ain't you! Mytyay croaked like half a year ago... And I was scared, thought it was some werewolf... was about to grab an aspen stake.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_8_106"><text>Yeah... Keep silver bullets for such cases - they're more reliable.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_8_201"><text>Where would I get silver ones?</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_9_101"><text>Hi, why you turning your mug away, like we don't know each other?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_9_102"><text>Me? What's the matter?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_9_103"><text>Not me... You, they say, crossed Tooth's path. Seems he even tried to put a hit on you for good money. We don't need walking tanks in the Zone, he says...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_9_104"><text>Do I look like a tank? Listen, since that's the case, tell me, 'cause I got something wrong with my head after riding the death truck. Can't remember who I am, kill me if I'm lying. So they called me Tank?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_9_105"><text>Is this some kind of joke? Really rode in a truck?... Ah, yes! I remembered, Tooth was talking about someone else. There's something elusive between you two... But it's definitely not you. So, see ya, man.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_9_106"><text>Elusive, you say... That's what I'm trying to catch, at least something.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_9_201"><text>Catch it faster, or it'll run away... Don't sweat it, just mixed you up.</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_10_101"><text>Hey, Garik, why so serious? You could at least say hello...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_10_102"><text>Well, I'm like, Marked One... But that's a nickname, and the name might be Garik.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_10_103"><text>Are you completely drunk? Forgot your own name? You didn't drink so hard before.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_10_104"><text>And before - when was that? Before I got into the truck or after? Tell me about me, what you know.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_10_105"><text>Hey! I didn't get a good look myself, half asleep. I'm thinking, well Garik can't get so wasted he doesn't remember his name... But this ain't Garik at all. My mistake...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_10_106"><text>Too bad... I was starting to like the name - Garik...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_10_201"><text>Move along, don't loiter...</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_11_101"><text>Yo, bro! You brought the grass?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_11_102"><text>Was I supposed to? You asked me to?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_11_103"><text>Quit joking around, if you got it - tell me the price, why you playing dumb? Don't be slow, Scarred, come on, what you got.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_11_104"><text>I've been slow for a long time. Looks like that truck I got off of didn't have brakes. I don't remember anything after it. You say I'm Scarred?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_11_105"><text>Were you shooting up or what, dude? That doesn't work anymore, last season's trick - grass from Agroprom... Wait a minute! Hey, you ain't Scarred! Why'd I take you for him? Move along, I didn't ask you nothing.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_11_106"><text>Well, I'm moving... you asked yourself, and now "move along".</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_11_201"><text>Come on, come on, get lost, we don't know each other...</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_12_101"><text>So what's up? Haven't seen you in ages, Vanyuha...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_12_102"><text>Been a while... Am I really Vanyuha?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_12_103"><text>What, hit it hard yesterday? I don't have anything to cure a hangover with myself.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_12_104"><text>Don't need it... So you recognized Vanyuha in me? Don't you remember where I'm from, didn't we talk about this before, by any chance?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_12_105"><text>Huh?.. Come stand closer to the light... Why you messin' with my head? What kind of Vanyuha are you! Go look for hangover cure somewhere else... some wise guy. Don't know you at all.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_12_106"><text>You started it first...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_12_201"><text>I ended the chatter...</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_13_101"><text>Greetings... Oh! Who are you?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_13_102"><text>Same to you. I'm just a stalker. Confused me with someone?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_13_103"><text>You look so much like our lieutenant colonel, a spitting image. You just need a cap and shoulder boards - couldn't tell you apart. We call him Boss among ourselves - you two aren't related?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_13_104"><text>Don't know... My memory for names and faces isn't great, and everything else too... This is after they found me by a truck.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_13_105"><text>Not related then. If you were related to our Boss, you wouldn't be hanging around here crawling in the dirt. Ah, if only I could be related to the defense minister - so he'd send me home for discharge faster...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_13_106"><text>Even better to be related to the president...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_13_201"><text>Ah... It's you... From the United Nations...</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_14_101"><text>Hey, Vityok?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_14_102"><text>Me?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_14_103"><text>You. What's with you, Vityukha, soon as you left us your nose went up... I see you're decked out with such trinkets I've never seen.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_14_104"><text>How long ago did I leave? Trinkets are trifles - you should tell me about me, I'd give them all to you for free... I came in a truck, heard about those? Don't remember a damn thing since then.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_14_105"><text>Yeah... damn. Never would've thought a guy from the truck would look so much like Vityukha. Keep your trinkets, I got nothing to tell you...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_14_106"><text>Alright... Maybe you do have something to say?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_14_201"><text>Go on, go on, move along... I was mistaken.</text></string>

<string id="fake_new_gg_15_101"><text>Hey, Vityok?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_15_102"><text>Me?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_15_103"><text>You. What's with you, Vityukha, soon as you left us your nose went up... I see you're decked out with such trinkets I've never seen.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_15_104"><text>How long ago did I leave? Trinkets are trifles - you should tell me about me, I'd give them all to you for free... I came in a truck, heard about those? Don't remember a damn thing since then.</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_15_105"><text>Yeah... damn. Never would've thought a guy from the truck would look so much like Vityukha. Keep your trinkets, I got nothing to tell you...</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_15_106"><text>Alright... Maybe you do have something to say?</text></string>
<string id="fake_new_gg_15_201"><text>Go on, go on, move along... I was mistaken.</text></string>

<string id="tesla_fanat_dialog_0"><text>Ever been to the Tesla Zone?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_fanat_dialog_1"><text>Nah... Far and dangerous. Mikha Crooked once bragged he could make it there... Borrowed gear from everyone, said he'd pay back with interest. I'll be back - you'll be amazed! He left, with the Guide it seems. Sent word he was back with loot, so we're waiting. Then suddenly another message on the network: Crooked's done for. We were amazed alright. And I gave him my rifle and sleeping bag. To hell with the gear, feel sorry for the guy.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_fanat_dialog_2"><text>Bad luck then.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_fanat_dialog_3"><text>Maybe bad luck. Or maybe... Don't want to talk about it.</text></string>

<string id="tesla_barman_dialog_0"><text>Listen, do you know who's been to the Tesla Zone?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_barman_dialog_1"><text>Can't say for sure who exactly. Some guy was bragging here once that he goes there like it's his own home almost. He's a talker... Smart people don't flap their tongues, they find out everything, learn, weigh all the pros and cons before going there. And the smartest ones don't go at all. Like old Starik, you don't know him - this was long ago, he went and vanished. Even though he found a safe route, from the Guide it seems. Went and even came back, but still ended up vanishing there later... Or maybe not there. You want to poke around there too?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_barman_dialog_2"><text>Thinking about it... Just weighing all the pros and cons.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_barman_dialog_3"><text>Think, think. You know the saying - measure seven times and then sew up whoever you need... Just kidding.</text></string>

<string id="tesla_voron_dialog_0"><text>Have they brought you anything from the Tesla Zone? I'm interested in who's been there.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_voron_dialog_1"><text>Well, they brought stuff... Said it was from there. A couple guys hired some guide as an escort to there, or maybe just to there... I didn't ask much. But they're gone now. Went to another place later, and both died there. They say a giant trampled them. Who's gonna check now, and what difference does it make how...</text></string>
<string id="tesla_voron_dialog_2"><text>Yeah... No difference "how", the result's the same...</text></string>
<string id="tesla_voron_dialog_3"><text>Maybe not... But there's something bad about these stories about guides. Like they're guiding people to the other world...</text></string>

<string id="tesla_kruglov_dialog_0"><text>What have you heard about the Tesla Zone?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_kruglov_dialog_1"><text>Nothing definite. Mass of theories, no reasonable explanations. There are descriptions, suppositions, hypotheses. Even some measurements... Our colleague went there for an experiment with some guide, the guy escorted him. So he told us some things... But he's not here, they took him to the mainland. Got poisoned by something.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_kruglov_dialog_2"><text>Looks like they give you poor quality alcohol for experiments. No wonder he got poisoned...</text></string>
<string id="tesla_kruglov_dialog_3"><text>Hmm... Well-well. Who knows...</text></string>

<string id="tesla_pahom_dialog_0"><text>So you just sit here? What about wandering somewhere farther, toward the center?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_pahom_dialog_1"><text>It's far... Need a reliable guide, can't make it without one. This stalker came by once... haven't seen him in a long time, maybe he's gone already... So he said there's this person who can show you the way wherever you want. Only you need to know exactly where you need to get to. True, he said that guy's a bit not right in the head or not of this world. And loves to hit the bottle. Can you really rely on a drunk, especially one who's "not right in the head"? That's why none of us used his services.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_pahom_dialog_2"><text>Yeah, taking a drunk with you on a trip is the worst...</text></string>
<string id="tesla_pahom_dialog_3"><text>Especially some of them...</text></string>

<string id="tesla_jila_dialog_0"><text>Why so gloomy? Like you buried someone.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_jila_dialog_1"><text>Heard about Borka Gray? I told him, don't get mixed up with these shady deals! Who the hell knows what's inside them. And he tells me: "I know this guy - reliable man. He knows all the paths and trails, don't worry! He'll guide you himself, or if not himself, he'll tell you how". So much for don't worry, Borka bought it like a rookie - flew into a "Whirligig" and that's it! Or someone helped... unclear. Screw these know-it-alls! Where, I ask, does that guy know all the paths from, huh? Screwed him over, the bastard... for sure.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_jila_dialog_2"><text>Like your Borka was a saint! He probably screwed the guy over before... So he got what was coming to him.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_jila_dialog_3"><text>There are no saints here, but there are cursed ones...</text></string>

<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_0"><text>You know different trails... Can you tell me something?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_1"><text>What should I tell you and why?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_2"><text>You don't have to, of course... I'm just asking. It's like, your specialty. So can you help? Need to get through the Tesla Zone further north, but the electricity's in the way.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_3"><text>Help... I can help, but will you really want me to help you? Where you want to get to is very dangerous, I'm telling you this without any drama, if you go there, you'll lose your head, that's for sure. No alternatives.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_4"><text>How to get there, I already know. And I know it's dangerous there. But I heard there's a more or less safe trail there and you supposedly know about it. You are the Guide after all.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_5"><text>"Guide"... "Specialty"... "You know trails"... People say different things, and you listen. Have you met even one person I showed a trail to? Talked to him yourself, face to face, not through rumors? That's the thing, that's the whole problem. You don't understand anything. And nobody understands anything.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_6"><text>Why are you talking in riddles? Some big secret?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_7"><text>Ehhhh... What's a secret got to do with it... I'm not being capricious, I'm scared myself, and scared for you too. Interested now? Look how you perked up your ears. It's a long story.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_8"><text>I'm not in a hurry, tell me.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_9"><text>Then get out a bottle, I'll tell you the story over drinks. Then you decide what you'll do about it.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_101"><text>Don't have any with me, but wait, don't leave. I'll be right back.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_102"><text>Yeah! I happen to have some right here... Shall we have a drink?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_11"><text>Let's do it!\nI'm just a regular stalker, so I'll tell it like it was, and whether you believe it or not is up to you.\nBasically, I became a "Guide" about a year ago, after one incident. An emission started once, and I had nowhere to hide. I completely missed it and started looking for a good spot, got all flustered, and then "thunder struck"... I was dashing around like a madman, got really scared, trying to find at least some hole to bury myself in. The emission had already started, and suddenly out of nowhere I realized that two hundred meters to the left there was a ruined farm and there was a good cellar there. Somehow a revelation just hit me in my head - that I needed to get there!</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_12"><text>Intuition, or what?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_13"><text>Maybe intuition, maybe revelation, maybe a gift. I ran to that farm and hid. Thank God, made it in time. Since then, how do I put it... if I need to get somewhere, I know exactly how to get there quickly and safely. And lately, to know how to get somewhere, I don't necessarily have to have been there before. Like someone draws a map in my head.\nThat's how it is. Maybe another one?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_14"><text>Let's do it... Huh! Can't even believe it... You're lucky!</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_15"><text>That's what I thought at first too. Everything would be fine, I'd live without a care, just rejoicing: any loot I want is mine. But it turned out not to be so simple. I only learn the route when I'm already very close. But while I'm searching, I can get into trouble 10 times. But I can calmly show others the way, even from far away. Such is the gift... And I should be taking loot from stalkers for this, living without worry - I wouldn't need to go anywhere myself. Only now I feel that I don't need such a gift at all, because it didn't appear in me for nothing. And what kind of gift is this anyway, it's a curse of the Zone, not a gift. After all, everyone I somehow show the way to goes much further than the places they wanted to reach.\nE-eh... My soul burns! Pour some more!</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_16"><text>Coming up. Let's go! And where do they go?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_17"><text>They lay down their heads for nothing, that's where... I didn't pay attention to this at first. But then I look - one died, there's talk about the second one disappearing, the third got into trouble somewhere... I didn't connect it right away, because it was much later after I showed them the way. But then I specifically showed one guy a path... And that was it. He's gone - vanished. And then it hit me: I'm the one responsible for their deaths! Or rather, it's my curse from the Zone, damn it! Such a mark from the Zone is on me. You're also marked by the Zone, but you just don't have memory... But this! I'd rather get such a mark than this "gift"!</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_18"><text>How would you know what's better?.. "Just no memory"... how simple everything is for you. We all want to have something different.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_1_dialog_19"><text>Don't get worked up. One's own pain always hurts more.</text></string>

<string id="tesla_provodnik_2_dialog_0"><text>Tell me about how you became a "Guide".</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_2_dialog_1"><text>Hmm, well get out a bottle, we'll drink, maybe it'll relax me. Then you decide what you'll do about it.</text></string>

<string id="tesla_provodnik_3_dialog_0"><text>So how are you? Will you tell me about the path through "Tesla"?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_3_dialog_11"><text>What?... Oh! That one... Wait a bit... something's not right with me... Aha.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_3_dialog_21"><text>Had too much to drink. Alright, back off.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_3_dialog_12"><text>Eh? You still want to get this "gift" from the Zone? Everyone only has one life, you like to take risks?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_3_dialog_22"><text>Cut the whining already... My life has always been my responsibility. Come on, lay it out, what do you want? Not for free, I understand...</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_3_dialog_3"><text>You're a fool, Marked One! You think I'm bargaining with you and driving up the price? I don't need anything from you. I wanted to stop you, but you understood nothing. But since you're "all grown up"... So you were there, you say... And came back alive. Strange, so the Zone must be protecting you for some reason. What did you leave there anyway? It's a cursed territory. I wouldn't go there if I were you, might not be so lucky the second time...\nAlright! Describe that place to me, but in detail, I've never been there even once.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_3_dialog_4"><text>How can I describe it to you, especially in detail? If I knew that area in detail, I wouldn't be asking you. Is there no other way?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_3_dialog_5"><text>Why not... There is. Don't you have anything from there with you? Any object - a pebble, a twig, old scrap metal... In places where I haven't been myself, I can only orient this way.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_3_dialog_6"><text>I don't have anything from there, didn't take anything.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_3_dialog_7"><text>What do you mean nothing?! You walked around there. Take off your boots, I'll try to sense something through them... \nEw! What a stench! Take them back, I've read the aura imprint. Now don't bother me, take a walk for about twenty minutes, I need to figure this all out.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_3_dialog_8"><text>Like, get into it? Got it. I'll wait.</text></string>

<string id="tesla_provodnik_4_dialog_0"><text>Hey, snap out of it! Is there a path?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_4_dialog_11"><text>Don't bother me yet. I haven't figured it out yet.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_4_dialog_21"><text>Well, I'll wait some more.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_4_dialog_12"><text>Well then... Remember, you wanted this yourself. I sketched this out for you. Look here - these marks are "nodes". Between them run "threads". Walk strictly along the "threads", a step or two to the side - you'll get it so bad your boots will stick together. Got it?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_4_dialog_22"><text>Got it, I'm not stupid. And where does this path lead anyway?</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_4_dialog_3"><text>I don't know, that remained hidden from me.</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_4_dialog_4"><text>Well hell with it, thanks for that anyway! See you later, "scourge of God".</text></string>
<string id="tesla_provodnik_4_dialog_5"><text>Take care... If you come back from there - drop by, we'll talk.</text></string>

<string id="dsc_green_near_dv_dialog_101"><text>Hello, stalker! Sit down by the fire, let's chat. Where from, where to, what for?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_green_near_dv_dialog_102"><text>Hi, but I don't really have time to sit around, running on business. What about you? Hunting?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_green_near_dv_dialog_103"><text>Well yeah. Something like that. Or they're hunting us. Can't tell here in the Zone. Everyone calls me Chinaman, and what about you?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_green_near_dv_dialog_104"><text>I'm Marked One. Hmm... You don't really look like a Chinese guy though?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_green_near_dv_dialog_105"><text>I'll remember you, Marked One. As for the nickname... It's been dragging since mandatory service, from the army. We had this jokester - he stuck it on me. My last name is Nikitin. And he says: Chinese surname - Nik-I-Tin... So it stuck. And why are you called Marked One?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_green_near_dv_dialog_106"><text>Just somehow. Probably because of the tattoo on my hand, or because of scars. Sidorovich called me that. I don't remember anything myself.</text></string>
<string id="dsc_green_near_dv_dialog_107"><text>Yeah. The worst thing is not knowing anything about yourself. Maybe you're a great person, but you're rummaging in dirt with everyone else. Though, looking from the other side - knowing about yourself that you're dirt isn't particularly fun. So how about tea? Made from mutated currants?</text></string>
<string id="dsc_green_near_dv_dialog_201"><text>We meet again, Marked One.</text></string>

<string id="gen_hermit_start_dialog_101"><text>Oh! Are you alive? Or... No! Don't come closer...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_start_dialog_102"><text>Hmm, another nutcase. But at least you're not grabbing for your gun.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_start_dialog_103"><text>Yeah, sorry, I haven't seen regular people here for a long time, so I had my doubts...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_start_dialog_104"><text>Regular? What, are there irregular ones? I'm Marked One, by the way.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_start_dialog_105"><text>Very, very glad to meet you, Marked One. My name is Ilya, but I'm better known as Brainiac. As for irregular people...\nHere in the Zone, regular is hard to come by. But the "Tesla" zone is especially unique in this regard. I think this is exactly where it all started. Did you see how the earth is heaved up? What kind of force would you need to wake up for this to happen? That's just it. They opened the gates unknowingly to something otherworldly. Yeah... Did you see the skeletons? That's THEM. The very ones. Who worked here. There was also a lot of stuff in the underground. But almost immediately after this all started, they brought troops here and pulled out everything they could from the underground and took it away. And what couldn't be taken - they destroyed. They probably wanted to blow it up too, but THEY interfered... Those very ones, the irregular ones.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_start_dialog_106"><text>But who are THEY?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_start_dialog_107"><text>Well, I'm telling you. What, aren't you listening?\nThose who worked here. The skeletons. Sometimes, not very often, of course, but they kind of come to life. They get up, walk around, do something. Those who were guards - they even seem to shoot at someone. And such a low, rumbling hum. Turns you inside out.\nAnd very rarely it happens that you start to feel their fear, hope, despair. All at once...\nI thought they could be understood... I approached, extended my hand. This one, the left. And that was it. Woke up a day later. Now I can't feel my hand at all. As if it's not with me, someone else's.\nAnd THEY, the further it goes, the stronger, more alive, somehow. Some of them you can't tell from a human anymore. Just God forbid you run into THEM...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_start_dialog_108"><text>Uh... interesting story.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_start_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, are you alive? Phew... must have been my imagination.</text></string>

<string id="gen_hermit_tesla_dialog_0"><text>Listen, what are you doing here anyway?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_tesla_dialog_1"><text>To be honest, I don't know myself. I'm waiting for when that unusual time comes again, when THEY will be HERE again, and not THERE. My consciousness torments me that somewhere nearby is the solution. The solution to everything - the Zone, anomalies, and life itself.\nSo I wait, and hope, and... fear. Until my knees shake. I always considered myself a brave man, but now... What awaits us THERE? And is there even such a thing, this THERE?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_tesla_dialog_2"><text>Damn, you're really messed up. Alright. You haven't heard of such a stalker by any chance - Strelok is his name?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_tesla_dialog_3"><text>Strelok? Yes, I heard. Supposedly he found a path to that very Monolith. Well, the one that grants wishes. And supposedly Strelok wished for the Zone to end, but this didn't happen. Or did it? Where is that Strelok now? And where are we all? Maybe the Zone disappeared, and we all became shadows in the world of the living? What do you think?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_tesla_dialog_4"><text>I think... I think I'm hungry. And since I'm hungry, that means I'm alive. And the living belong among the living. Something like that.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_tesla_dialog_5"><text>Yeah, yeah... Look, there's plenty of such hungry ones on the surface. Corpses crawl out of graves and reach out, and moan, and are ready to devour. Are they also alive then? That's just it...\nYeah, also about Strelok. At one time they said that the path to the Monolith starts somewhere around here. And Strelok supposedly knew where exactly. And at Mikhalych's they chattered that for this you need to pass the "Labyrinth". What kind of tales you don't hear...\nYou said you're hungry? I have a small stash. Can trade for vodka. For a bottle I'll give a couple of cans.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_tesla_dialog_6"><text>Wait a minute. Tell me about the "Labyrinth".</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_tesla_dialog_7"><text>Haven't you heard? There are such places in the Zone that are surrounded by all kinds of anomalies, but in their center you can find something very special. Either some artifact of extraordinary power and usefulness. Or a hole in space through which you get to another place. Here, at "Tesla", there is one such "Labyrinth". Your Strelok, by the way, could have passed through it.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_tesla_dialog_8"><text>How do people even walk around here when the discharges hit so hard that your boots almost fly off?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_tesla_dialog_9"><text>People say there's a safe path. And supposedly someone boasted that he has a map with such a path. What was his name... No, I can't remember - I was drunk then. Supposedly the Guide drew him that map.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_tesla_dialog_10"><text>And how do you yourself go to people? Canned food doesn't fall from the sky.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_tesla_dialog_11"><text>What about me? It's routine business, and it's not far from here to the nearest stalker camps. As soon as you get out, to the right are transformers, and behind them is the passage to those... to the Warehouses. Well, where the Freedom guys are. But I don't like going there, it's noisy. The road that goes south will lead to the passage to Limansk. Quiet little town, almost no beasts, peaceful there. One trader set himself up comfortably there, goes by Mikhalych. Clever guy, supposedly Sidorovich's godfather. And so, people say there's a path here to the "Brain Scorcher" too, and somewhere else, but I haven't gone myself, don't know. If you need to, look for it.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_tesla_dialog_12"><text>I'll look, if I don't get fried.</text></string>

<string id="esc_mil_hermit_dialog_0"><text>Haven't seen any scientists here? Supposedly they were heading this way in mid-spring?</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_hermit_dialog_1"><text>Uhhh... Yeah, they walk around sometimes, who knows. I don't ask for passports. Mid-spring, you say? Cough. Yeah, there were some, I think.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_hermit_dialog_2"><text>Well? Don't keep me in suspense...</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_hermit_dialog_3"><text>What "well"? One guy dropped by here. Eyes like cataracts. Was asking about a safe path. Promised to pile up cash. But what do I need their money for? I sent him away. Too arrogant he was behaving. But in general there was a whole squad there, ten guys or even more. Soldiers on guard, and that one, with the cataracts, was like their guide. And why did he bring them here? These are cursed places - even a hedgehog understands.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_hermit_dialog_4"><text>And where did they move on? And what about that cataract guy? What was his name?</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_hermit_dialog_5"><text>The cataract guy, what was his name... Ah! Transparent. Or no... Something otherworldly... Ghost, maybe. Yeah, that's it - like that. This Ghost, I remember, said that they have special suits that can withstand the local discharges. And that's why they're going where nobody goes - to the antennas. And there the discharges are the nastiest, by the way... But there was something there, very interesting for science. And Ghost, it seemed, needed something else... His eyes kept darting around.\nAnyway, they headed north from here. And I haven't seen them since.</text></string>

<string id="gen_hermit_x6_dialog_0"><text>Get this, I came here from the "Brain Scorcher" through the underground!</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_x6_dialog_1"><text>You came and you came, what's got you so excited? Good for you, I guess. Or you're a fool... Depends how you look at it. Many of these undergrounds are connected to each other. That's how they were built...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_x6_dialog_2"><text>And you apparently know a lot about this?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_x6_dialog_3"><text>Well, not that much. It's just that in the time I've been here, I've had a chance to see some things, talk to knowledgeable people, read some documents... THOSE who are here sometimes have records with them, diaries, other papers. And when THEY are not here, you can take them and read. I thought a lot, compared, figured this way and that...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_x6_dialog_4"><text>And what did you figure out?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_x6_dialog_5"><text>As I understand it, all these underground laboratories were built in the late eighties. How many of them - nobody knows, but many. Just the numbered ones alone should be a couple dozen. Here, for example, is X-6. It's connected to X-8, which is that very one at the "Brain Scorcher". I've heard about X-18, X-16, X-12.\nFor what purpose were they all built and why underground? I think they wanted to create some weapon of intimidation, because then, in the eighties, it was clear to everyone that using nuclear weapons would be more expensive for yourself - you could destroy the whole earth.\nSo they kept developing. Apparently, something happened... Many laboratories weren't evacuated at all. After all, most of them employed prisoners, such "sharashkas". And the leadership at that time... You probably remember? Coups, revolutions, independence... So everything fell apart.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_x6_dialog_6"><text>Yeah... But some laboratories are still radiating something there, as they say.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_x6_dialog_7"><text>Yes. They built them well. Triple redundancy of all main systems. That's why some underground facilities look similar. Power was also duplicated, of course. They didn't just get energy from Chernobyl, but also from their own geothermal installations. So yes, it's still humming underground. Something's knocking, and maybe someone... Suddenly, they forgot to tell people that the Union no longer exists, so they continue to work hard. I don't know, I don't know...\nGot anything to drink? My throat's gotten dry...</text></string>

<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_0"><text>I met with Fox, he told me about you, sent his regards.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_1"><text>Yeah, yeah. Solid guy. We drank vodka together, and not just once. Haven't seen him for a long time, how is he?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_2"><text>He was planning to get out of the Zone. Said he was fed up to here. So, I don't know if you'll see each other again...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_3"><text>We'll see each other! The Zone, brother, doesn't let go... Many have sworn off. Beat themselves in the chest with their heels: I've had enough of this nonsense up to here. It's over, they say, enough! Yeah right. But in half a year or a year, look, familiar names appear on the net again. So... He shouldn't have sworn off.\nBut what was your conversation with Fox about? Why were you mentioning me?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_4"><text>He was telling how you guys discussed those... clairvoyants. And that you knew such a one. Well, and he mentioned his debt. As I understood it, he left it near some "gravi-trap". What the hell is that thing?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_5"><text>Doesn't matter. So people still have conscience. Didn't forget, then, little Fox about how Ilyukha helped him out. Well, that's heartening. And about clairvoyants... That's a long story.\nThough, maybe you'd find it interesting. You've probably heard about monolithians? Well, that they're half-crazy and not of this world. Some people take the second part of the sentence literally. This, of course, is nonsense. There are a number of theories, the meaning of which boils down to the fact that everything that happens in the world is recorded in the "matrix". Or, as it's also called - in the noosphere. According to another, much less popular theory, monolithians somehow learned to extract various knowledge from this "matrix".</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_6"><text>And what do clairvoyants have to do with this?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_7"><text>My throat's gotten dry. You'd pour something for the conversation? Otherwise it's all questions, questions...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_81"><text>I'll pour for you, no problem, but I won't drink myself, don't even try to persuade me. In these places, giving up your soul to God is easy as spitting, and when drunk - even more so.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_82"><text>I don't have any with me. Maybe later?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_91"><text>Yeah, I insist... Well, to your health! Ah! Different stuff! Otherwise, you understand, it's depressing here. Well, listen on.\nYou yourself said you don't remember anything about yourself, right? And somewhere there, in the information field, there's a complete dossier on you! Where you were born, what you dreamed about in first grade, what kind of women you prefer... I don't know for sure if those memories can be shoved back into you, but something like helping you remember, I think, is possible.\nI once talked with one guy, you probably don't know him. He used to be like a scientist. He studied something in the Swamp.\nHe also had such a surname, bird-like. Either Solovyev or Dyatlov. I don't know how he did it, but the fact is he knew how to look into the "noosphere". He would fish out such things for me that good Lord! Maybe it would be useful for you to talk with him too.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_92"><text>Well, when there is some, then we'll talk about it. I think it would be useful for you to listen.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_10"><text>Bird-like surname? Something familiar... And where is he now?</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_11"><text>In his time he was, you could say, a celebrity. Local scale, of course. Then he went to Pripyat. Said he needed to develop his abilities. Maybe his abilities worked better closer to the center of the Zone?! Anyway, there in Pripyat he joined the monolithians and, according to rumors, even headed their faction soon after. That's how it is.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_dialog_12"><text>Pripyat... And how, I wonder, did this Solovyev-Dyatlov make it all the way there? Alright, thanks for the story. I'll keep it in mind. You never know what the devil might bring...</text></string>

<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_done_dialog_0"><text>Shall we talk about clairvoyants? I've got a bottle.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_matrix_done_dialog_1"><text>Then don't keep me waiting. Pour it to the brim so the conversation turns out soulful.</text></string>

<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_101"><text>Man! Great! Thank God!</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_102"><text>Oh... What are you doing here? Problems?</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_103"><text>You bet! My friend got paralyzed. Some infection hit him, so now he can't move. And I can't pull him out myself: even though I have artifacts with protection from discharges, here's the trouble - all the batteries died. Thought we were done for. I tried to call for help from someone - silence. Communication, fuck, that is, comes and goes...\nDid you catch my message or are you here by accident? Can you help, maybe?</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_104"><text>More like by accident. How can I help? And who are you anyway?</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_105"><text>Friend, we need a couple of charged batteries. Doesn't even have to be "fully charged", but at least half capacity, enough to get out of here with guarantee. With activated artifacts I'll be able to drag my friend to Limansk. And there it'll be easier. At least, fewer unexpected troubles.\nDon't doubt our gratitude! We're from the "Seekers" ourselves. Ivar is our leader - probably heard of him? We'll pay up, be sure. There's a recipe for one artifact, just right for such terrain. Oh, sorry. What's your name?</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_106"><text>I'm Marked One. I've heard something about Ivar. "Seekers"? Why that name?</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_107"><text>I'm glad to meet you, Marked One. Very much! And "Seekers"...\nIvar organized our group, he lost a friend at the "Brain Scorcher", that one turned into a zombie. That's it. And Ivar doesn't believe that zombified people can't be returned to normal life. Says there's such an artifact that can return to the head what was there before... Well, something like the imprint of a person's personality always exists in some world of information. Such an artifact finds this imprint and copies it into a specific brain...\nThat's it. Ivar searches for such an artifact, and even seems to have found it already. And he got other stalkers enthusiastic about such an idea. So we search. "Seekers", that is...</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_108"><text>And this Ivar of yours - is he a scientist?</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_109"><text>Can't say for sure, but there's something like that about him. He was like an orderly in a madhouse somewhere or something like that... Tried to treat crazy people...</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_111"><text>In a madhouse, you say? Don't you know if he was acquainted with Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_112"><text>Don't know... Wait, Strelok... Strelok... He said something like someone threw him some idea. He walked around all wound up after that: can't be, he says, that it's all for nothing. We must find it, he says...</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_113"><text>Find what? And when was this?</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_114"><text>Well you asked! Do you yourself ask everyone when who met with whom, what they said? Do I need this? I didn't understand jack shit myself then... So, something was said in passing, I forgot. If you hadn't asked, I wouldn't have even remembered that.</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_115"><text>Yeah, of course... It's just that I found some interesting data about psychos. I'm thinking: whose is this. Maybe your Ivar's, or maybe Strelok's himself...</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_start_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, hey... So how is it?</text></string>
<string id="tex_gen_iskatel_akkum"><text>Seeker at Tesla is asking to bring a couple of batteries. Theirs are completely dead. For this he promises a recipe for some unusual artifact</text></string>

<string id="gen_iskatel_akkum_dialog_0"><text>I have a couple of batteries.</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_akkum_dialog_1"><text>And? Why are you being so meaningful?</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_akkum_dialog_2"><text>Hmm, remembered that nobody ever gave me even a stone for free...</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_akkum_dialog_3"><text>Don't have anything valuable with me right now. Got a couple of artifacts with protection from "Electra", but as you understand, they're desperately needed... But here! Take this recipe. Cooking a "Battery" artifact according to it is expensive, of course, but you get a rare specimen, and in this area it'll be very useful, trust me.</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_akkum_dialog_41"><text>I'll trust, once again. Here you go.</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_akkum_dialog_42"><text>Let me look around first...</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_akkum_dialog_5"><text>Don't frown. Ivar will stand up for his people, even if something happens to me... If we make it to Limansk - we'll meet there, come by, we'll discuss what and how.</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_akkum_dialog_6"><text>And this Ivar of yours, where can I find him? I've got some business to discuss with him.</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_akkum_dialog_7"><text>Hmm, don't know exactly. Was at the Warehouses last time, he's looking for a path through the "Brain Scorcher". Says there are unique artifacts there, further toward the center. The kind we need - us "Seekers".</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_akkum_dialog_8"><text>Oh yeah? Well-well, alright, I'm off.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="gen_iskatel_limansk_dialog_0"><text>I see you made it. I'm glad. And how's your friend?</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_limansk_dialog_1"><text>I'm glad to see you too, Marked One. And my friend died. When you showed up he was already very weak. As soon as we left the basement, the very first discharge finished him off. There, at the farm, I buried him as best I could. Such is life.</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_limansk_dialog_2"><text>Sorry of course, but you're alive, and that's better than two corpses...</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_limansk_dialog_3"><text>Yes, if not for you, we'd be lying in that basement together. But it's alright, now I'll pull myself together a bit, gather strength, and I'll need to go look for Ivar. Haven't heard from him in a long time. Strange.</text></string>
<string id="gen_iskatel_limansk_dialog_4"><text>You're a Seeker, you'll find him. Good luck to you.</text></string>

<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_101"><text>Well, hello! Hope to slip through the "Brain Scorcher"? Heard enough, I bet, about "artifact fields"? These fairy tales are only for clueless dummies...</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_102"><text>I have my own interest. And you, then, are not a dummy?</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_103"><text>Huh?! What, did you get offended? For nothing. This isn't a pioneer camp... Almost nobody returns from here alive. Shake hands, friend. What's your name?</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_104"><text>I'm Marked One. If you're not a dummy, then what are you sitting around here for?</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_105"><text>Playing the coward. Didn't have the guts to continue tempting fate with a real man. Now I'm hoping he'll return. So I wait. And... Fear... Such a coward... So what are you here for?</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_106"><text>You don't look very scared? And I have one assignment that I need to try to complete. Who's your friend?</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_107"><text>Friend? Ah! No, I can't say about Ivar that he's a friend to me. He... He's a leader, he's the one people follow. But... Few can call him friend. He tries to help those who lost themselves. Those unfortunates whose mind was damaged by this very "Brain Scorcher" or other dangers of the Zone. And he'll achieve his goal, I know. Only I didn't dare accompany him to where he headed. And when he realized this, he said I should stay here and prepare everything necessary for his return. And I... I agreed...</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_108"><text>And this Ivar... He treats people, then?</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_109"><text>Well, if you consider zombies people... Before, yes, he seemed to try treating people too, psychos that is... He, I think, worked somewhere in a psychiatric clinic, or had some connections, can't say for sure. He himself didn't elaborate, but I heard in passing. A man came to him once, asking about some psychos. Ivar also told him about some clinic, and that man asked him to collect information about crazy people... I didn't pay attention because their conversation became strange, very specific: "deviations, diagnoses, symptoms, insulin, therapy...", blah-blah - incomprehensible. I stopped listening, but I gathered that Ivar understood what he was talking about. And that man also listened intelligently... \nWhy are you looking so glum? Boring topic, I agree. But you asked yourself...</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_110"><text>That's not the point, it's just I thought... You say Ivar passed information about psychos to that man? What was his name?</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_111"><text>How would I know! He didn't introduce himself, came and left. Some shady character, just confused Ivar. Ivar walked around all wound up after that: can't be, he says, that it's all for nothing. We must find it, he says... And I didn't tell you that Ivar passed something to him, I said that guy asked Ivar to gather the info he needed somewhere, even on a flash drive...</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_112"><text>Yes-yes... exactly on a flash drive. So there's something important there after all.</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_113"><text>Where?</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_114"><text>On the flash drive... That's about my business, don't worry about it.</text></string>
<string id="rad_ivar_drug_start_dialog_201"><text>Marked One, hello... How are you?</text></string>

<string id="mil_freedom_commander_101"><text>Hello, stalker! We need help! All kinds of evil comes from the "Brain Scorcher", soon there'll be another wave! If you have a rifle with good firepower, can you help?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_1021"><text>No, I can't, I have my own business.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_1022"><text>I'll try to help...</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_1023"><text>Don't have a rifle with me, but I'll get one.</text></string>

<string id="mil_freedom_commander_1031"><text>That's a shame... Then go, don't hang around here.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_1032"><text>Excellent! Go get on the tower! They'll come rushing now. Hit them from above, don't go down, or we might accidentally treat you to some lead. Task clear? Can you shoot?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_1033"><text>When you get one, come back if you don't change your mind. Just don't drag it out - if not today, they'll attack again tomorrow.</text></string>

<string id="mil_freedom_commander_104"><text>I know which end the bullet comes out of, don't worry.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_105"><text>That's good. Hope we'll stay alive. Yeah, don't go far... Or I'll think you decided to run away. I'll think it with all the consequences, mind you! Well, get to your position.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_106"><text>To the tower, then? Alright...</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_151"><text>What else? You had your own business, right? Well go... About your business.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_152"><text>Yeah...</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_201"><text>No time for talk! Evil's coming! Run to the tower! Shoot!</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_202"><text>Alright, alright...</text></string>

<string id="mil_freedom_commander_251"><text>Got the rifle?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_2511"><text>Got it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_2512"><text>Not yet.</text></string>

<string id="mil_freedom_commander_301"><text>Looks like we nailed them all. As for me, that's enough for today. Thanks for the help! What's your name, by the way?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_302"><text>They call me Marked One. I'm looking for a stalker named Strelok. Haven't heard of him?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_303"><text>Hmm, something's spinning in my head, but... No, can't say for sure. And you seem to be a pretty good marksman yourself! Why do you need someone else?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_401"><text>Greetings, Marked One, how's life? Still searching? Good luck!</text></string>

<string id="pribor_out_semenov_dialog_0"><text>I lost your device, can you help?</text></string>
<string id="pribor_out_semenov_dialog_1"><text>Damn... now Sakharov will eat my head off! Well... Alright, I have another one, formally written off. One of our graduate students managed to drop it into a springboard. Good thing it was right at the edge and the device was just thrown aside a few meters - turned out to be repairable.\nIn short, will you give good artifacts for it? A couple of second level? If you have third level, one will be enough.</text></string>
<string id="pribor_out_semenov_dialog_21"><text>Well, what can you do... Here's a couple of artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="pribor_out_semenov_dialog_23"><text>Tough luck... Alright, here's one third level.</text></string>
<string id="pribor_out_semenov_dialog_31"><text>Hide it quickly so the professor doesn't see. And don't lose it anymore, this is the last one.</text></string>
<string id="pribor_out_semenov_dialog_22"><text>I don't have any artifacts.</text></string>

<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_info_dialog_0"><text>Your battalion commander said there would be a reward for the work done.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_info_dialog_1"><text>Not battalion commander. His deputy. Yes. He called for me. We talked for a long time. Seems like he liked you. We discussed and decided to offer you a choice. We can give you up to five of our army medical supplies with anti-rads per day. Or ammo for Kalashnikov, also once a day, about a hundred and fifty. But only during my shift. The fewer fellow soldiers know that you've been put on allowance - the better. Otherwise they'll start asking questions... that's unnecessary. So choose what you need more.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_info_dialog_21"><text>I'll probably take the medicine.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_info_dialog_22"><text>Need ammo constantly, so I'll choose that.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_info_dialog_31"><text>Right. The main thing is health. Everything else will follow. Here, take today's batch. And come back another day when I'm on duty. There'll be the same package waiting for you. Go on, good luck.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_info_dialog_32"><text>Well then. Ammo will always be needed in this place. Here, take them right away, as I said, hundred and fifty. Every day during my shift there'll be the same amount set aside for you. Come by.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_info_dialog_4"><text>Good, understood. Thanks.</text></string>

<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_medkit_dialog_0"><text>Can I get the medicine as we agreed?</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_medkit_dialog_1"><text>Yeah, sure, why not. Prepared it since yesterday evening. How are you in general? Alright? It's boring here. Sometimes for the whole day there's nobody to talk to.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_medkit_dialog_2"><text>I'm alright. Don't really have much time. Always business, business...</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_medkit_dialog_3"><text>I get it. Here, take this package. Drop by when you can, we'll knock back a shot, talk. Our guys promised to throw in some snacks...</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_medkit_dialog_4"><text>Alright. Maybe I'll swing by. Later.</text></string>

<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_ammo_dialog_0"><text>Can I get the ammo as we agreed?</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_ammo_dialog_1"><text>Yeah you can, why not? Prepared it since yesterday evening. How are you in general? Alright? It's boring here. Sometimes for the whole day there's nobody to talk to.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_ammo_dialog_2"><text>I'm alright. Don't really have much time. Always business, business...</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_ammo_dialog_3"><text>I get it. Here, take these bullets. Drop by when you can, we'll knock back a shot, talk. Our guys promised to throw in some snacks...</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_nagrad_ammo_dialog_4"><text>Alright. Maybe I'll swing by. Later.</text></string>

<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_101"><text>So-o-o... Marked One, as I understand? I'm deputy commander of the special forces battalion. I was informed that I can count on you.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_102"><text>Yes, I'm Marked One. And whether you can count on me depends on what exactly you want from me.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_103"><text>Then straight to business. In mid-spring a military-scientific expedition was sent. An experienced stalker nicknamed Ghost volunteered to be the guide. Unfortunately, the expedition vanished without a trace. But, as it became known, Ghost was seen alive some time later in places far from the route the group was taking. Understand?</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_104"><text>Mmm. Not quite. Where was the expedition going?</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_105"><text>The final destination wasn't disclosed, but there's data about the last point where the group made contact - a small town called Limansk. There's reason to believe that the group made contact with one Mikhalych.\nWe don't want to risk untrained soldiers by sending them deep into the Zone. They won't pat you on the head for personnel casualties.\nSo we need an experienced person who can find out the circumstances of this expedition's disappearance. So your task is to reach Mikhalych as quickly as possible and get concrete facts.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_10501"><text>I'm not getting something, commander...</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_10502"><text>You wanted to learn about Ghost, as I was informed. Well, you'll learn about him at the same time.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_10503"><text>Yeah, about Ghost, I think you've already said everything and won't say anything new. Ghost was the expedition's guide, that's clear. So if I find him, then you're basically not needed anymore. But I don't understand from what angle you're interested in this expedition. Plenty of scientists wander around here, maybe they flew away long ago and didn't tell you anything... What's the need for you to worry about their fate?</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_10504"><text>The expedition was accompanied by our soldiers, and their fate interests me much more than the botanists' fate. Clear now?</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_10505"><text>Actually - completely unclear. I may be without memory, but my head's working fine... I hope. You judge for yourself: you say you have a SPECIAL unit here, not just anything. You know soldiers went missing, surely comrades of those who stayed here. And you sit here, all military, armed to the teeth, but you don't want to risk your people unnecessarily, you say. As if searching for your missing comrades isn't a necessity at all. You're offering this to the first civilian you meet, so to speak. As if I have more strength, and weapons, and more serious reason to look for your soldiers... Well, I don't get it, no matter what.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_10506"><text>That's exactly what we can do, if you ask nicely. We can apply just such measures to "civilians" like you - violators illegally penetrating guarded territory with weapons... Alright, don't strain yourself. Let's talk seriously.\nThe scientific riffraff doesn't matter to me, you're right, they have their own command. But soldiers went missing. But I can't say they died. What then? Who knows... Maybe they ran, maybe they told everything to go to hell, dug in somewhere and are drinking vodka, understand? Need to find out for sure. If you find their tracks, remains or something like that - then everything's clear. Or you don't find anything - then something becomes unclear.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_10507"><text>So what?</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_10508"><text>What, what... Judge for yourself: they were assigned as escort by order. And if I send more people to look for them now, without orders from above, they might get interested, start finding out - where, why, who sent them, weren't there enough of those... And if it turns out they ran away, or abandoned the botanists, which is equivalent to unauthorized abandonment of post... In short, I feel sorry for the boys, understand? If this turns out to be exactly the case, then figure what awaits them. And I would find a way to reason with them, they'd return and we'd settle it here ourselves, without "commissions" and "inspections" - cover it all up. That's why I'm asking you, that's why this needs to be done quickly, before they're missed. Does it get through to you?</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_106"><text>Well then. That's a completely different story. Otherwise look: "Shortest timeframe! Execute. Yes sir!" Now it's clear why you're not sending your own, should've started with this.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_107"><text>Don't always need to start with the main point... So, deal? I ordered some equipment prepared for this trip. You'll take it from the box at the entrance. Just look: you take it, means you're signing up for this business. I await results. Just let me know through Sidorovich when you'll be returning, so no misunderstandings happen. That's all.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_108"><text>I got it, alright. Can I ask a favor in advance? Order your guys under the bridge to let me pass without inspection. I'm tired of running around.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_109"><text>You'll be let through without hindrance. I'll give the order.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_201"><text>Time is passing. Don't delay.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_202"><text>Yes-yes, I understand.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_301"><text>So you returned. Well, frankly speaking, didn't expect it. Too much is said about stalkers. Alright, let special agencies deal with that. What about our business?</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_302"><text>Well... managed to find what remained of the expedition. There's such an area in the Zone, stalkers call it "Tesla". Very dangerous: constant electrical discharges, radiation, unusual monsters...</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_303"><text>I understand already - you heroically overcame all this. Closer to the topic.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_304"><text>Anyway, everyone stayed there. Both scientists and your military.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_305"><text>Everything pointed to this, but there remained hope that... However, that's pointless. Did you manage to learn anything concrete? Why did they die? And why was the guide seen alive? And where is Ghost now?</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_3061"><text>Unfortunately, I don't have exact answers to all these questions. Apparently, there was no gunfight there, and everyone died instantly. Only one scientist lasted longer than the rest, about him later. Some bodies were gnawed by monsters, but already after death, that's certain. So the local wildlife definitely had nothing to do with people's deaths. Among the corpses there was no body of Ghost, naturally. According to Mikhalych, the trader from Limansk, he quietly left the squad while still in town. Nevertheless, I believe that at "Tesla" he caught up with the group again. What really happened there - can only be guessed. However, among the belongings of the scientist I already mentioned, this note was found. Whether to believe what's written or not, decide for yourself. But personally it seems to me that Ghost is involved in the death of all these people. Where he is now and how to look for him - I have no idea. I'm curious myself. That's basically all.</text></string>

Where he is now and how to look for him - I have no idea. I'm curious myself. That's basically all.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_3071"><text>Not much. Alright, we'll try to get to Ghost through other channels. Well, and to you... gratitude. This gratitude will be expressed in more substantial form. What specifically - I'll convey through Kuznetsov. You're apparently great friends with him. From me personally, accept this recipe. The smart guys invented something new there. And now, you may be free.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_3072"><text>Not much. Speculation, assumptions, and no facts. Alright, we'll try to get to Ghost through other channels. Well, and to you... gratitude. You already got the advance, a hefty one, I want to note. If there were some concrete evidence, I'd throw in something more, but like this... You may be free.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_308"><text>Well alright. I hope if you find out something about Ghost yourselves, you'll find a way to signal me too.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_401"><text>For now you're free. If I need you - I'll let you know.</text></string>
<string id="esc_blockpost_commander_dialog_402"><text>Yes, yes, I understand...</text></string>
<string id="tex_tesla_expedition_article"><text>Not often do I get to work for the military. This time I agreed to do a favor for Colonel Obukhov from Cordon. He asked to find out the fate of a scientific expedition whose final destination is unknown. Their last communication session was from Limansk. The scientists were guarded by a group of soldiers, and their guide was Ghost himself. This mysterious stalker was later seen alone in other areas, the rest disappeared without a trace. Need to obtain material evidence regarding what happened to the expedition and report to the colonel.</text></string>

<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_0"><text>Heard something about the scientific expedition that Ghost was leading?</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_11"><text>Maybe I heard something, maybe I didn't... What do you need it for?</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_12"><text>So we agreed, right? Please the old man - give an artifact, maybe memory will kick in. Then we'll talk.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_21"><text>Here's a third-level artifact... Bon app‚tit.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_22"><text>Here's three second-level ones... Won't you burst from gluttony?</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_2"><text>I need Ghost and the expedition's fate also concerns someone.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_3"><text>"Ghost"? That bastard Guide, slippery one - when he comes nobody sees, and when he disappears, nobody notices either... And what, you say, someone's worried about the expedition? And you, then, hired yourself to find that out? So you probably already got a bag of money? Eh?\nYeah, don't twitch - money's your business, I don't look into other people's pockets. But I'm not sitting here for free either, I do know something - so maybe something should come my way for this knowledge too. Eh?\nLet's say like this - a little artifact... around third level... would honor the old man.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_41"><text>Well, what an appetite you have, old man. Alright. Agreed.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_42"><text>Don't have anything like that with me. Maybe something else?</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_51"><text>Fine appetite, nothing to say - won't complain... Hmm, but this artifact seems a bit rotten? Well alright, let it be like that.\nListen here:\nThat was back in spring. This slippery Guide showed up here, but not alone, with a bunch of nerds and about five soldiers guarding them... the soldiers even started hassling stalkers, but those quickly calmed them down. So anyway, they went somewhere in the city, and when they returned, they brought in a bag what was left of Carbide - knew Carbide? Well, the one who flew into the "Vortex" - such a sight it was... I'd rather not have seen it.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_61"><text>Forget about that Carbide, tell me what happened with the expedition.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_71"><text>That's what I'm telling you... don't interrupt or I'll forget!\nDamn you, threw me off track... What was I saying?\nAh! They wanted to go to "Tesla". And there electricity strikes - terrible! But supposedly they had some protection, something new - brought it in boxes. I didn't see it myself, the guys told me. So there they went, but back - they didn't return. Somewhere there they vanished... terrible place, that "Tesla".\nThat's how it happened, and that slippery one didn't go with them - I'm telling you straight! He vanished that very day when they arrived - disappeared like he always knows how to do. The head scientist nearly choked on foam when he learned that Guide left, but there was nowhere to go, so they trudged off where they were planning...\nSo that's the story. And your Guide, I haven't seen him since that day. But someone told me they saw him in the forest. Well, that one in the Limansk reserve. Probably likes mushrooms too... What do you think?</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_52"><text>What kind - another one, second level? Well, devil with you, give me two of second level... no - three!.. got carried away talking.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_621"><text>Alright. Agreed. Well, what an appetite you have, old man.</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_622"><text>Hmm. Don't have that many...</text></string>
<string id="esc_mil_mikhalych_dialog_72"><text>Well... if not, then not - your business.</text></string>

<string id="voronin_prot_out_dialog_0"><text>What the hell?! Where are my artifacts and everything else?!</text></string>
<string id="voronin_prot_out_dialog_1"><text>What do you mean? Why are you yelling?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_prot_out_dialog_2"><text>There was loot in my storage locker! A lot! And now there's basically nothing there except a couple of dead cockroaches!</text></string>
<string id="voronin_prot_out_dialog_3"><text>Calm down! Artifacts, you say? Hmm... Strange that they disappeared. Nobody ever complained before.\nAlthough... Recently one stalker was rummaging around there suspiciously long. Could it be him?! Listen, Marked One, be sure, we'll find and punish the thief!</text></string>
<string id="voronin_prot_out_dialog_4"><text>They'll punish... I'll figure it out myself. Who was hanging around there, you say?</text></string>
<string id="voronin_prot_out_dialog_5"><text>I already said - don't get worked up! If you make a big deal out of it, you'll only make it worse for yourself.\nLet's make a deal? We'll handle everything ourselves, and then tell you when we find the thief. And of course, we'll return your valuables, if he hasn't drunk them away by then.</text></string>
<string id="voronin_prot_out_dialog_6"><text>I'll see... And where am I supposed to store my honestly earned goods now? You can stop offering your "services"...</text></string>
<string id="voronin_prot_out_dialog_7"><text>There's a stalker in the Bar, he also takes stuff for storage. Look into it.</text></string>

<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_101"><text>Hello, stalker. Haven't seen you around before. Newbie? What's your name? What are you looking for here?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_102"><text>Sorry you haven't seen me. My name is Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_103"><text>Marked One? I've heard something about you. So, not a newbie. I'll ask again: what are you doing here? Or just dropped by to chat with our Bootlegger?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_104"><text>I have memory problems. I'm looking for those who might recognize me. Or know about a stalker nicknamed Strelok. Or about Ghost. Well, and in general - looking around.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_105"><text>Hmm... About Strelok, I think many have heard. Only there's been no news about him for a long time. Ghost dropped by not too long ago. Took supplies and left. Where he is now - no idea. We're "Freedom"! We don't pry into people's souls.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_106"><text>So nothing definite? Too bad.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_107"><text>Well... I wouldn't be so categorical. If we move to mutually beneficial cooperation, maybe something useful for you will surface.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_201"><text>Marked One? Got something to say?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_301"><text>Well hello, stalker. How's life? Getting better? I see you're a quick guy, running around here and there. Will you do a small favor?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_302"><text>Depends on what kind.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_303"><text>Well, it's generally a trivial matter, but for you, a neutral, it'll be easier than for one of ours. I heard that some pretty useful guys showed up in the Gut - hunters. Like they cook good food and all that. Talk to them, maybe they'll agree to send us some of their delicacies sometimes? And we won't be stingy - we'll pay everything fair and square.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_304"><text>Oh yeah, delicacies! I've tried their delicacies - stench beyond belief. But seems nutritious. Alright, if I'm in those parts - I'll ask.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_305"><text>You ask, and whether it stinks or not... you know, you yourself smell so bad it brings tears to my eyes, but nothing - we don't turn our noses up.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_new_start_dialog_401"><text>Hello, Marked One! How are you, wanted something?</text></string>

<string id="mil_leader_food_0"><text>About your request, concerning the delicacies.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_food_1"><text>Delicacies? That's... Ah! And what's the story?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_food_2"><text>I recently had to visit the Gut, with the hunters. Talked about supplying you with their sausage. Anyway, they agree. For fifty sausages they want a couple pieces in currency, or equivalent in artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_food_3"><text>Well holy shit! Two tons of green for stinking garbage! They've completely lost their sense of smell there! Hell knows what, people have nothing to eat, and these... Alright. I get it. Thanks for the "good" news. We'll have to send an "official delegation" to them, apparently.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_food_4"><text>So what? That's it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_food_51"><text>What? Ah! You want to get tons of loot for your talking? Sorry - no bananas. Alright, don't bug your eyes out... Here, take three government bottles. For health improvement.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_food_52"><text>What? Ah! You want to get tons of loot for your talking? Sorry - no bananas. Alright, don't bug your eyes out... Here, take a handful of bullets, can't help with anything more.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_food_53"><text>Well then, you did fulfill my request, yes. Of course, this should be rewarded. Take these medical supplies. Things that are always needed in stalker business, isn't that right?</text></string>

<string id="mil_leader_about_freedom_0"><text>I want to ask: why is your faction called "Freedom"? What does this even mean to you?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_freedom_1"><text>Hey, brother, what questions you have! Freedom is the most important thing there should be in life.\nInside every person there's a desire to be happy. And by and large, it's precisely in the absence of external coercion to unwanted actions that the feeling of happiness lies. The greatest misfortune is power over personality. Power, coercion from another person or group of people.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_freedom_2"><text>So you have no power? And some Lukash doesn't command?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_freedom_3"><text>You're confusing the concepts of power and organization. Power is violence against personality. Violence that humiliates a person, forces him to be not what he would like to be. But I only organize. I provide some coordination of actions of separate free personalities, necessary for survival. Each person has his own vision of this necessity, and I can only show the right path.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_freedom_4"><text>Right? "Right" for whom?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_freedom_5"><text>For the one who agrees with me. And the one who disagrees can directly express his vision. We'll discuss everything and come to a unified decision. And if not, then again, no violence - let him go his own way.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_freedom_6"><text>Really? And if this disagreeable person just starts shooting?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_freedom_7"><text>Violence against free personalities ends with a response - destruction of the instigator of violence. Everything is fair. "Freedom" is not biblical pacifism or non-resistance to evil! "Freedom" is the absence of oppression from an individual or group of people. That's how it is. And who to listen to - everyone chooses for himself. Show your path - we'll see.</text></string>

<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_0"><text>I need to tell you something important. There's a squad of Duty guys holed up not far from here...</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_1"><text>Where exactly? How many? How armed? What else do you know? Don't chicken out, Marked One, "Freedom" remembers those who help it. As well as those who harm it. Speak.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_21"><text>At the farm south of you, near the road. About ten men. Armed with assault rifles, grenades, didn't notice any sniper or heavy weapons. Supposedly on some mission here, from what they said. Even offered to participate. That's all.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_22"><text>I don't know the details, to be honest. I only know there's about ten of them, set up at the farm south of you, near the road. Your guys asked me to pass this along. I was even surprised: why do they need a messenger when they have PDAs? I even saw one of them had a radio.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_23"><text>Stop-stop! All this is pointless. It so happened that I personally delivered an order from Duty leadership to the commander of that squad to cancel the operation... if I understood everything correctly, of course. I think very soon they'll get out of here.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_311"><text>Oh really! Don't trust these red-bellies. Bor was saying... Ahem... Anyway, time to give them a good beating! What about you? Will you join our squad?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_312"><text>Ah! You mean those guys. Well, we already dealt with them. Took you long enough to bring the news.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_313"><text>You sing smoothly, Marked One. This all looks too much like a setup!</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_411"><text>No. Your squabbles are none of my business.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_412"><text>Well, that's how it turned out.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_314"><text>What setup? I was just told to...</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_511"><text>Well, that's your business. We'll handle it ourselves. And thanks for the story.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_512"><text>Alright, anyway - thanks.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_315"><text>Who told you? What exactly were you supposed to pass along? Hey, guards!</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_316"><text>Easy, guys, easy! I...</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_317"><text>Listen here: now you tell us everything-everything, with all imaginable details. Otherwise - I promise - you'll regret you were ever born.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_318"><text>Anyway, there's this guy in "Duty" - Ivantsov is his surname. He hired me. Said to find Major Cherepanov at the Army Warehouses, at the southern farm, pass along a few numbers verbally.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_319"><text>What numbers? How exactly did the phrase sound that you were supposed to pass along?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_320"><text>How would I know what numbers? Probably some code. Well, pure spies. The phrase was: mission cancelled, act according to code twenty-nine, thirteen and eight are out of the game. That's all.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_321"><text>Well, and then?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_322"><text>Then I trudged to the warehouses, on the way to the farm I met your guys. They asked me to tell Lukash, that is you, that a squad of Duty guys showed up here. I got to the farm.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_323"><text>And what there?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_324"><text>Talked with Cherepanov. He offered to participate in their operation, but I didn't even get into it - refused. Passed along what they asked, he dictated return numbers for Ivantsov.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_325"><text>Which ones?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_326"><text>Seven, seventy-two. Ah! Also I'm supposed to tell Ivantsov that "Skull understood everything". There...</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_327"><text>Oh, these conspirators... Alright, seems our agreements are still in force... however, this no longer concerns you.\nNo complaints about you, guy, but to finally bury this unpleasant story, let's do this: you'll pass along different numbers to Ivantsov. Not seven and seventy-two, but, say, seven and seventy-five. Do it - you'll get something valuable and gratitude in your personal file, and if not, you'll get a reprimand with entry... in your chest cavity. Relax, I'm joking. Just want to... teach our restless opponents a lesson. So, will you do it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_about_cherep_328"><text>Uh... probably possible. We'll see.</text></string>

<string id="mil_leader_return_cherep_done_0"><text>I'm about that story with the Duty guys... well, about the "spy" nonsense with numbers.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_return_cherep_done_1"><text>Eh? Oh! I already forgot to think about it... well, had a laugh with the guys about these "secret agents", and threw it out of my head.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_return_cherep_done_2"><text>Wait... you yourself asked me to give Ivantsov the wrong numbers. I did as you said, so what now?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_return_cherep_done_3"><text>What now? We'll see what kind of fuss your message causes with the enemy... there are people to check this. And to you - gratitude in your personal file, as agreed. They might even give you a medal. Need one?</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_return_cherep_done_41"><text>Hey, Lukash, that's not how business is done! You promised something valuable...</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_return_cherep_done_42"><text>Well screw you then. I'll manage.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_return_cherep_done_5"><text>Alright, alright, don't be angry, I'm joking. Just in a good mood. Here, take this.</text></string>
<string id="mil_leader_return_cherep_done_6"><text>Yeah... see you later, joker.</text></string>

<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_101"><text>Greetings, brother. What wind brings you to us, to the Farm? Call me Mikhas. And how should I address you?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_102"><text>I'm Marked One. I have my own business.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_103"><text>Oh! So you're Marked One? That very one? I heard they say about you that you're looking for Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_104"><text>Well... They say a lot of things, can't believe everything... What's it to you?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_105"><text>Don't get prickly... Maybe I can help? And you... Well never mind.\nHere's the deal: not long ago one guy dropped by... for a purchase. Gave his PDA to transfer money. Well, from that PDA besides money I managed to grab a bit of information. Wanted to sell it to Tooth, but we didn't make a deal... And they told me at the Bar that you're looking for Strelok... So there. Get it?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_106"><text>Not yet. Do you really sell for money? Thought it was only for artifacts? And what kind of guy?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_107"><text>What's it to you? For money or how... The question now is about something else. This guy clearly wasn't one of ours. Spoke with such an accent, immediately clear - westerner. And such a sophisticated guy had interesting info in his PDA. About Strelok... Information is for sale. The rest doesn't concern you.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_108"><text>You're selling a pig in a poke. Would like to take a look...</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_109"><text>Don't doubt, it'll be interesting for you. In short: someone, while still in "Clear Sky", hired a mercenary to search for Strelok. So, from the information it's clear where you can find this someone. Well, then you'll have a more concrete talk with him.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_110"><text>And you said about Strelok... You're pointing me to some nobody yourself. Beating around the bush... And what's the price for the tip?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_111"><text>Two hundred thousand. In bills.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_112"><text>You gone crazy? For information "go to another guy, you'll learn everything from him"? Won't something burst on you?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_201"><text>So what? Cooled down? The principle is simple: goods - money - goods. I need money, and you need information. You can walk around in circles as much as you want, but...</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_202"><text>Four grand in bucks! For words...</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_203"><text>Think about it... This guy, about whom the information is, was apparently acquainted with Strelok. And he's the one who hired a killer to hunt Strelok. Why? What didn't they share? He surely knows so-o-o much more...</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_204"><text>Listen, did you also want to shake money out of Ivar at the Bar? And didn't make a deal with him either, as I understand?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_205"><text>Ivar? And how do you...</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_206"><text>From a camel... He said you wanted fifty grand from him.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_207"><text>Don't try to bluff me... I named the price, it's up to you to decide.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_2041"><text>Damn you! Why should I save money now?! Here are the bills. Now it's your turn.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_2051"><text>You did right... So, here's how it is. There was this Lebedev. Either a professor, or just a security guy masquerading as a scientist, but he wanted to kill Strelok. And now this same Lebedev is in Pripyat! And not just like that, but became like the leader of that sect - the monolithians. They call him a bit differently there - Swan Liaison, something like that. That's in brief. You can read more details yourself. That's it, I uploaded everything I had. Think it over.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_2061"><text>Lebedev-Liaison. Pripyat. Alright...</text></string>

<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_2042"><text>I don't have that kind of money... With me.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_2052"><text>Alright. Then thirty thousand... Rubles. But! You need to go check out one little place, information about which, note, was also in that PDA. So it might also concern Strelok.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_2062"><text>You dropped your price pretty sharp... Too weak to go yourself? And what does "check out" mean?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_2072"><text>I could go myself, but you're the one who needs Strelok...\nThe place there isn't the most welcoming. And there's word about you that you're a master at coming out of such places alive. Well? How about it? Give me thirty grand and I'll outline the place for you...\nAnd there very well might be something you need too. And us. The guy was clearly not a loner. One of those sent specially. They have loads of different gear. Well, and there's possibly a warehouse. If you get through - outline a map of how to get there.\nAnd leave a beacon there for precise guidance.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_2082"><text>Give you thirty grand for me to scout the route?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_2092"><text>Eh-eh-eh! No! Thirty grand for me to draw you an awesome storage location... And then you decide for yourself.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_2101"><text>Alright. You talked me into it, you smooth talker. Stick out your pocket for the cash.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_2102"><text>I think I'll manage without this... See you.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_211"><text>You won't regret it - for sure! You heard about Foggy Thicket? There, according to the description, there's a small cave. That's where very serious people set up a secret storage. I won't mark the exact spot, of course, but approximately over there...\nYou install a beacon there and come back. Then everything I know, you'll know too. Here, take this beacon.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_212"><text>Thicket. Foggy. Nasty place. Well, whatever...</text></string>

<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_301"><text>How's it there, buddy? Found that place we talked about? Or are you just here to chat?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_3021"><text>Well, found it... Dropped the beacon where you asked.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_30211"><text>Uh-huh... Seems to be there... Well I'll be, you actually made it...</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_30212"><text>And you didn't hope... And you lied about everything. There's no awesome warehouse there. Maybe there was once, but now there's nothing. \nSo what are you mumbling about? That's it. As agreed, transfer the data.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_30213"><text>Don't rush... Everything will be according to the deal.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_30214"><text>Well, I did everything right, didn't I?</text></string>

<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_3022"><text>Yeah, to chat... My talkative ones...</text></string>

<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_3023"><text>I thought a bit. Anyway, here are the bills, as you asked... Give me back the thirty grand and transfer the data.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_30231"><text>Hey, brother! That's not how it's done. You already signed up for the job, a deal is more valuable than money.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_30232"><text>I changed my mind. Four grand in bucks doesn't suit you anymore, or what?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_30233"><text>It's not your business what suits me. And you're not a girl to act coy - I want, I don't want. You took it on - do it! This is already a matter of principle. Otherwise, you understand, word will spread quickly, nobody will trust you anything with such an approach.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_30234"><text>Alright, don't scare me... We're already scared. Just wanted to check your reaction.</text></string>

<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_401"><text>So what, friend Marked One, matured to a normal decision? The money's peanuts, I don't understand what you're being tight about?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_4021"><text>Take the thirty grand. Draw the place.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_4022"><text>It's not about the money. I don't like all this.</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_4023"><text>I'm not going anywhere, here, there are bills for the full amount...</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_501"><text>How's life? Found your Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_dialog_502"><text>Still looking...</text></string>

<string id="lost_lebedev_pda"><text>Information about Lebedev</text></string>
<string id="lost_lebedev_pda_desc"><text>
The following information was obtained from a reliable source:\n
About a year and a half or two years ago, a "Clear Sky" group appeared in the Swamp under the command of one Lebedev... \n
This faction solved practical tasks for studying the Zone. At first glance - simple information collectors. However, what they were actually "collecting" is unknown. As are their true purposes for being in the Zone. Their main cover was scientific research, although the group was led by professionals in military affairs.\n
After some time, stalkers joined them. Nicknames Ghost, Strelok, Fang. They began actively working with these "scientists" and were interested in strengthening this clan's positions for unclear reasons.\n
One Strelok had a huge desire to penetrate the center of the Zone and even made an attempt (result unknown, Strelok and his group disappeared from sight from this moment). According to reports, it was after this that Lebedev came into confrontation with this group, despite all the previous help this faction had received from it...\n
The search for Strelok was unsuccessful. The other two were not worked on... \n \n
Currently we have the following:\n
Lebedev has long been listed as dead, which does not actually correspond to reality. His search was undertaken in connection with suspicion that he very likely may have the object of interest to us or has concrete information about it.\n
After the Radar installation was shut down, a sortie to Pripyat was undertaken, where, according to group reports, Lebedev was discovered. The group did not return and does not communicate.\n
Awaiting instructions.</text></string>

<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_0"><text>Do you know about "green", that is "emerald" artifacts?</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_11"><text>What a question! Of course! These are artifacts that are made from the very best ones... Want to know how? I know how to get "emerald" "Jellyfish", "Stone Blood" and "Wrenched". My interest is a couple of first-level artifacts or one second-level for any of the recipes. Just so the artifacts are in good condition, you can keep the rotten junk for yourself! Will you take it?</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_12"><text>You already asked... Hand over the artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_21"><text>For the "Jellyfish" recipe, here are two first-level artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_22"><text>Really need to cook "Wrenched", here are two first-level artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_23"><text>Taking the recipe for emerald "Stone Blood". Here's a couple of first-level artifacts.</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_211"><text>Here's a second-level artifact, give me the "Jellyfish" recipe.</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_221"><text>Here's a second-level artifact, give me the "Wrenched" recipe.</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_231"><text>Taking the "Stone Blood" recipe. Here's a second-level artifact.</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_31"><text>Okay! Listen here: if you throw a "Jellyfish" artifact into the "Fruit Punch" anomaly in Foggy Thicket, you can get its emerald variety. Just look! The "Jellyfish" must be completely non-radioactive!</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_41"><text>And where can I get such a "Jellyfish"?</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_32"><text>Alright. So, listen: "Wrenched" needs to be thrown into "Fruit Punch" - that's such an anomaly. But not just any, but in Foggy Thicket... There, in this thicket, hell knows what's going on in general... Ah! And "Wrenched" must be completely non-radioactive!</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_42"><text>And where can I get such a "Wrenched"?</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_33"><text>Didn't I tell you about this recipe? Emerald "Stone Blood" is cooked in a special place - in Foggy Thicket. There time is like not of this world, so there you need to find a bubbling anomaly, they call it "Fruit Punch". You throw regular "Blood" there... Ah! Not completely regular. You need "Blood" without any bad properties. I think such ones sometimes come up... There.</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_43"><text>What if none turn up? Where can I get such "Blood"?</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_5"><text>Uh... Ask other stalkers. Or... Hey!\nSidor's godfather exchanges bad artifacts for good ones. Go see him. Sidor will tell you how to find his godfather, if needed.</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_24"><text>I'll think about it. Maybe I'll come back later.</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_about_greens_dialog_44"><text>Alright, I'll try. Maybe something will work out.</text></string>

<string id="lim_zub_about_reds_dialog_0"><text>Tooth, are you selling recipes for artifacts from the "ruby" line? I'll pay well.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_about_reds_dialog_11"><text>Wow! You're pretty excited, Marked One. Looks like you really need these recipes. And... I have them. I know how to get "ruby" "Battery", "Spring" and "Pellicle". All guaranteed. A guy "cooked" them in my presence. It'll cost a lot - two any artifacts of "Dummy" class, zero level, that is in excellent condition. That's for one recipe. Like that, no haggling. Can you handle it?</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_about_reds_dialog_12"><text>We already talked about this. Hand over something from the "Dummy" class. Two pieces per recipe, and they must be zero level.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_about_reds_dialog_21"><text>Will these two artifacts do? I'm interested in the "Ruby Battery" recipe.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_about_reds_dialog_22"><text>Really need to cook "Ruby Spring". I have such artifacts. Will they do?</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_about_reds_dialog_23"><text>Here's a couple of artifacts. Tell me the recipe for "Ruby Pellicle".</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_about_reds_dialog_24"><text>I'll think about it. Maybe I'll come back later.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_about_reds_dialog_31"><text>Yeah. Just what's needed. Here's how to cook the artifact you need: an ordinary "Battery" should be thrown into "Snow" - that's such an anomaly, in case you didn't know - and wait around a couple hours. Easy as pie, right?</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_about_reds_dialog_32"><text>Fine. So, listen: a simple "Spring" needs to be thrown into the "Snow" anomaly and wait about two hours. That's all there is to it.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_about_reds_dialog_33"><text>Well, write it down. Or will you remember? Anyway, you throw an ordinary "Pellicle" into the "Snow" anomaly, wait about two hours, and - voil…! Everything's quite simple, as you can see.</text></string>
<string id="lim_zub_about_reds_dialog_4"><text>Well, thanks. I'll run along...</text></string>

<string id="bar_zub_aver_way_0"><text>Listen, Tooth, I want to find out something else about emerald artifacts...</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_aver_way_1"><text>Well? All the recipes I know I already gave you. What else?</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_aver_way_21"><text>No, I'm not about the recipes themselves. You said they need to be cooked in Foggy Thicket, but can you tell me the path there? I somehow didn't think to ask right away...</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_aver_way_22"><text>No, I'm not about the recipes themselves. You said they need to be cooked in Foggy Thicket, but is there no short road there, do you know? Don't want to make a detour through Dark Valley, and show myself to the local contingent once more.</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_aver_way_31"><text>Well, look at that! He's going to cook emeralds... I thought you yourself knew how to get there, since you were quiet. Ah, but you have head problems... Alright, for the sake of our future fruitful cooperation, so to speak... Give me your PDA, I'll mark everything for you.</text></string>
<string id="bar_zub_aver_way_32"><text>Ah, that's what you mean... Alright, for the sake of our future fruitful cooperation, so to speak... Give me your PDA, I'll mark how you can quickly get there from the Garbage.</text></string>

<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_105"><text>Tough guy? With a knife, sure, that's possible, nobody's immune to that business... But it won't help you. We planted explosives all over the bridge, and if I don't switch off the detonators, anyone who climbs up is a dead man. So it's simple as mooing: either you pay and go, or you don't pay and don't go. Clear?</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_106"><text>We'll see about that...</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_107"><text>Look all you want. We don't rush headfirst into a fence. We live peacefully, keep the bridge intact, so simple folks can haul their loot... You should understand.</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_201"><text>Hello there! Is that you again? Want to stomp across our bridge? Or just dropped by to chat?</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_202"><text>Your bridge? And you're what, a watchdog?</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_203"><text>Listen, don't start: you give me an artifact and go on your way, or no - hit the road.</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_2041"><text>Now! Take a bullet, bastard!</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_2042"><text>Got a second-tier artifact lying around, take it.</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_2043"><text>Here, take this, third-tier artifact!</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_2044"><text>Take this dummy artifact, hotshot...</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_2045"><text>What if I don't have an artifact?</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_2051"><text>Good deal! I'll switch off the mines now. Wait a bit. Don't rush.</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_2052"><text>Then you better turn around.</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_206"><text>Switch them off, I'm waiting.</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_301"><text>So what? You either go, or... Or do you want something?</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_401"><text>Hey! You there, look - we're holding like a checkpoint here. So that, you know, everything's proper. Well, you get it?</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_402"><text>You lot are multiplying... I already paid up!</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_403"><text>Calm down, brother, I'm showing you all respect... I know about you paying up. Good one! But that was then... We have this kind of order: coming from Limansk, you share an artifact. And not some junk... And if you got no artifacts, then turn your skis back around.</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_404"><text>Really! And if I put a knife to your throat?</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_405"><text>Tough guy? With a knife, sure, that's possible, nobody's immune to that business... But it won't help you. We planted explosives all over the bridge, and if I don't switch off the detonators, anyone who climbs up is a dead man. So it's simple as mooing: either you pay and go, or you don't pay and don't go. Clear?</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_406"><text>We'll see about that...</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_407"><text>Look, look all you want, we don't rush headfirst into a fence. We live peacefully, preserve this bridge, so simple folks can haul their loot... You should understand...</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_4081"><text>Now you'll understand! Take a bullet in the gut!</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_4082"><text>Is that so? You convinced me. Take this second-tier artifact.</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_4083"><text>Alright, got a third-tier artifact. Take it.</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_4084"><text>Preserving the bridge? For that I won't even mind giving a dummy.</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_4085"><text>What if I don't have such an artifact?</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_4091"><text>Well, you're a good one... Wait a bit, I'll switch off the detonators. Don't rush...</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_4092"><text>You washing your ears with compote or what? I said: no artifacts - go back where you came from.</text></string>
<string id="lim_scaut_dialog_start_410"><text>Switch them off, I'm waiting.</text></string>

<string id="bridge_guard_dialog_start_101"><text>What do you want? Need something from me?</text></string>
<string id="bridge_guard_dialog_start_1021"><text>Just move aside, want to pass through.</text></string>
<string id="bridge_guard_dialog_start_1031"><text>They walk here, and walk here... No peace at all...</text></string>
<string id="bridge_guard_dialog_start_1022"><text>Just wanted to say hello...</text></string>
<string id="bridge_guard_dialog_start_1032"><text>Huh? So what? You'd be better off going about your business... We'd all be healthier.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_101"><text>Well, well! Look what showed up... What are you sniffing around for? Looking for business? What's your name? Your handle, like, what's your nickname?</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_102"><text>Dogs have handles, I have a name: Marked One. I'm looking for someone.</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_1031"><text>Marked One?! So that's you, huh? You're my buddy now! I heard you stuck your neck out for me. I understand that thanks won't be enough... Well, the earth is round, you know, we'll settle up later. But for now here's a present for you, write down this recipe.\nWho you looking for? Maybe I know?</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_1032"><text>Marked One?! So that's you, huh? You're my buddy now! I heard you stuck your neck out for me, even though Rasp and the boys roughed you up a bit first by mistake. I understand that thanks won't be enough... Here's a present for you - found it nearby. And write down this recipe too.\nSo who you looking for? Maybe I know?</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_104"><text>Ever hear of a stalker called Strelok?</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_105"><text>Strelok, Strelok... Hold on a sec, something's spinning in my head... Ah! Right! The brothers were talking among themselves, saying that, well, Borov set up his base in a bad place, like there's a dungeon, or something else below, in the basement.\nSo they were saying that, well, this Strelok guy used to walk around there, all the way to the "Scorcher". You know, the one that won't let you go north. Yeah. But what your buddy was doing there and why he went there - hell knows.</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_106"><text>Underground? Is that the one that was collapsed?</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_107"><text>No! The collapsed one, that's the labo... rabo... Damn it, you'll break your tongue! Anyway, the nerds were doing something there. That one seems to be all understood, and it's not at the base either.\nNo. This is something else. This one guy, Mityai Bruise, well you probably didn't know him, he croaked last winter, he was all blue when he told about it, said that there, in that underground, you can go crazy, easy as pie... Well, you get it...</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_108"><text>Yeah. But how do you get into that underground?</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_109"><text>Damn if I know! The brothers were saying, like they blocked the door with crates long ago, like the entrance, so nothing nasty would crawl out from there. Such things happen there...</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_201"><text>Oh! Buddy! Maybe, you know, for the meeting?</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_2021"><text>Hmm, I'll pass, thanks.</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_2031"><text>Suit yourself, I'll relax a bit...</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_2022"><text>Another time. Got business with you.</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_2032"><text>So don't go soft on me like... a flower in ice water. Speak up.</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_204"><text>Dimon, Nut that is, said you know a lead, about Ghost's own stash.</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_205"><text>And where'd you see that vagrant? Ain't heard from him in a while.</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_206"><text>Sitting tight in the Gut. Says he's got some business there. So, how about that stash? You kinda owe me, didn't forget?</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_207"><text>Whatever I owe, I always pay back... Alright, listen here. There was this interesting stiff. Looks like the cards fell wrong for him that day, caught a bullet in the gut - and that's it. Found a note on him, seemed to be from Ghost himself to some buddy of his. And it said where he, Ghost, set up a stash in the District Center.\nI won't feed you empty talk, but so there's no complaints later, I'm saying right away - I've never been to the District Center and what kind of place it is, can't say for sure. And I don't remember anymore how it was written word for word on that paper. But what stuck in my head was this: need to look for a backpack on the roof of a half-destroyed Khrushchev building, from which you can take a look at Ilyich. What kind of Ilyich - hell knows.</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_208"><text>Yeah... not much to go on. Well, thanks for that much. See ya.</text></string>
<string id="dt_kocherga_start_301"><text>Oh! Marked and seasoned. Fifty each and let's chat, or you in a hurry?</text></string>

<string id="dt_fraer_start_101"><text>So what? Wanna talk - talk... Who are you anyway?</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_102"><text>Generally, I'm Marked One. And where you from, acting all tough?</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_103"><text>Whoa - hey! Marked One? I heard about you... Like you're looking for your buddy, who either got whacked, or something else. Or am I wrong? Well, I don't give a damn really. If you got nothing to do, then run around the Zone. I know where and why to move. You dig?</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_104"><text>Lot of words, but no substance.</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_105"><text>No substance? You're totally nuts! I opened up to you like to a priest - there's a stash, a rich stash! And the owner croaked, long ago... Only need to get to the stash. Like it's far. All the way past the "Scorcher".</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_106"><text>What's it to me? Go yourself...</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_107"><text>Shit! Just listen! It's that buddy's partner's stash. Yeah! What was his name...\nFix, maybe... No... Tooth? Nah, that one's stuck in Bar. Jaw... Tusk...\nCome on! Help me out! Something connected to teeth...\nThat one, who went on trips with your buddy...</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_108"><text>Ghost? Or Fang?</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_109"><text>Yeah! Exactly! Fang! So basically - this guy told me, who found this very Fang's note, where the richest stash lies. And nobody can get there, 'cause it scrambles your brains, if you go there through this, Radar. Get it? No?\nI see - nah...\nI know where the stash is, understand? Dough! Artifacts! But how to get there, to this very Pripyat, I don't know! You're gonna, fo' real, go there someday anyway, so if you find a secret path, whisper it to me... I'll break off a big chunk of that loot for you! Yeah? But you tell nobody!</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_110"><text>Why so sure I'll go to that Pripyat?</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_111"><text>Let's say I dreamed it. Or someone whispered...</text></string>

<string id="dt_fraer_start_201"><text>Oh! You! Brother! You, uh... But tell nobody!</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_202"><text>Brother? Don't remember such a buddy...</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_203"><text>Come on! Don't play dumb! I'm showing you all respect.</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_204"><text>Respected, I see. Well, well... So what we sitting here for?</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_205"><text>Well, met a buddy, got out of the can, from the slammer.\nMan, what bastards!\nAaah!\nSpit and rub it in.\nChatted with him, now I'm gonna stomp to my boys. To Limansk.</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_206"><text>Where? What you need in Limansk for.</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_207"><text>What, you don't wash your ears? I told you clear as day - got boys there. Boss gave us important business! Boys are already there, and I bolted here - had to check on a brother. Gonna stomp there before my boys drink away all my PDAs.</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_208"><text>PDAs? You got them? Many? What you need them for?</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_209"><text>Maybe many. What's it to you? Haven't heard about the serious Caucasian at the Warehouses? He pays good loot for any PDAs. And generally. I heard that lots of secret places are recorded in those gadgets. But almost all broken. Shame. Well, I talked too much - see ya, Marked... If anything - I'll be there for now, in this Limansk. Find me - we'll chat about our business.</text></string>
<string id="dt_fraer_start_210"><text>See ya, "respected".</text></string>

<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_101"><text>Oh! Hey there, Soaked! Let's shake hands. You, uh, how's things there?</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_102"><text>There? What you mean?</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_103"><text>Shit man, why you playing dumb? I told you all about that fat stash in Pripyat! Found it? How's it there?</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_104"><text>No, didn't find it. Didn't even try. You didn't give me any specifics then. I'm thinking there ain't no stash at all, you made it all up just to get the safe road to Pripyat out of me.</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_105"><text>Well you... I gave you the tip! The info's solid gold! I'd go look myself, but gotta keep watch here for now. Uh... Basically, can't leave - boss will blow my head off. And the stash, fo' real, exists, but to hell with it, don't need nothing from it, you can take everything yourself. Got different business there, in Pripyat, you're right.</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_106"><text>So that's how it turns out, huh? Your business don't concern me, just so you know. And about that path... I'll think about it. You were saying something about bunches of PDAs, remember?</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_107"><text>Yeah, there's such a thing, seems like our boys don't need 'em much. Wanna take some?</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_108"><text>Yeah, thinking of taking a couple, what you want for them?</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_109"><text>What? Money of course, what else? Give me like fiv... no, six thousand rubles and take this handful... But hell knows about them - they don't turn on, dunno if they work or not...</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_110"><text>I see. Alright, if I need them - I'll come back. See ya.</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_111"><text>Just don't forget my little request, yeah?</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_201"><text>Hello again. How's life and all that other stuff?</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_301"><text>Still hobbling around, Marked One! So, tell me something about that sacred path.</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_401"><text>Why you keep running back and forth. How's our business, figured out the deal?</text></string>
<string id="lim_lager_fraer_start_dialog_501"><text>Speak faster, gotta go.</text></string>
<string id="tex_lim_fraer_pripyat"><text>The bandit asks to find a safe road to Pripyat and bring him a scientific suit. Promised to give a lead on "fat" loot in the ghost town.</text></string>

<string id="semenov_rem_dialog_0"><text>Uh, how's your head?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_rem_dialog_1"><text>Marked One, what's wrong with you? What's with these sudden statements?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_rem_dialog_2"><text>I'm not... Not in that sense. I mean about myself... Don't even know if it's worth... Tell me, do you remember anything from your life? I mean, you do remember, of course, I wanted to say, how accurately do you remember everything?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_rem_dialog_3"><text>Uh... what are you getting at?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_rem_dialog_4"><text>You see, I'm new to the Zone recently, or maybe I've been here long, but I've only been aware of myself recently. I lost my memory. But from time to time something surfaces. I'll see something in the Zone, and bam - some connection to something, like from the past. And pictures in my head - like a familiar place, and there's someone familiar... But everything's somehow dim. I'm not sure it was exactly like that... Ah! Alright, this is about me, you won't understand... Forget it.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_rem_dialog_5"><text>Why not... I understand you. Actually, not every person can guarantee to recall the exact time and place of any event, even if reminded about it. A person isn't a machine, he doesn't store everything in memory so it's always "at hand" and you can take any data off the shelf at any moment. He doesn't go through episodes sequentially in memory, but remembers more associatively, in connection with something. There's something that reminded - you remembered. No - then it wasn't needed, and doesn't bother much. Even though you're new here, can you, for example, precisely remember what happened to you a week ago - exact place, time, circumstances and such?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_rem_dialog_6"><text>Well... I remember where I was, what I did. Roughly...</text></string>
<string id="semenov_rem_dialog_7"><text>Exactly - roughly. And only a week has passed. And the further back, the hazier the memories. Usually people remember from the distant past only some very bright moments, and even then vaguely. There's only a feeling that yes - this happened to me. But the memories themselves are at the concept level of what actually happened there.</text></string>
<string id="semenov_rem_dialog_8"><text>At the level of what?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_rem_dialog_9"><text>Concept... Well, it's a general idea, at the level of thoughts, sensations and impressions, without awareness of exact phrases, place, time. Roughly where, roughly when, roughly how... I think it's the same with you. Something suddenly reminds you of something, some connection arises, and something surfaces in your mind, resembling current events. Some bright association...</text></string>
<string id="semenov_rem_dialog_10"><text>So, you're saying that even you don't remember everything exactly?</text></string>
<string id="semenov_rem_dialog_11"><text>Of course. Nobody can remember everything-everything exactly. Of course, it depends on the person. Someone remembers more, someone less... Well, consider that I remember about myself a bit more than you remember about yourself, that's all... Look at it simpler.</text></string>

<string id="fake_rem_gg_1_0"><text>Can I have a word?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_1_11"><text>What?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_1_2"><text>Know of any medicine for memory?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_1_3"><text>There is. 50 grams, better yet 100 right away. I get like this, until I take some, can't remember a damn thing about what happened yesterday.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_1_4"><text>Joker... I'm serious.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_1_5"><text>So am I serious. And sometimes you forget so bad that even a hundred won't help, only a bottle.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_1_6"><text>Clear enough about you...</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_1_12"><text>You again? About memory?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_1_7"><text>Chill, better take a hundred.</text></string>

<string id="fake_rem_gg_2_0"><text>Can I have a word?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_2_11"><text>What?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_2_2"><text>Can you remember exactly where you were, say, a week ago?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_2_3"><text>What? Do I owe you or something?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_2_4"><text>No... I'm just asking. I don't remember exactly, how about you?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_2_5"><text>Get lost! Remember, don't remember... Here you can't even remember yesterday sometimes, and he wants "a week ago"...</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_2_6"><text>Alright, don't get heated...</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_2_12"><text>You again? Get lost.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_2_7"><text>I'm leaving already.</text></string>

<string id="fake_rem_gg_3_0"><text>Can I have a word?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_3_11"><text>What?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_3_2"><text>Do you remember anything from childhood?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_3_3"><text>What's it to you?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_3_4"><text>Don't be angry... Important for me to know. I don't remember myself, and if something does surface, it's somehow dim, as if it didn't happen to me.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_3_5"><text>Maybe it's for the better... I remember, but I had such a childhood, I'll tell you, better not to remember.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_3_6"><text>Sorry...</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_3_12"><text>You again? Remember something?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_3_7"><text>Well... something.</text></string>

<string id="fake_rem_gg_4_0"><text>Can I have a word?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_4_11"><text>What?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_4_2"><text>You got parents? Like - mom, dad...</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_4_3"><text>Nah... don't remember them. Why?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_4_4"><text>You don't remember either? How much do you remember from life generally?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_4_5"><text>I remember everything, why you pestering me! And my mom and dad were drunks, they say, that's why they dumped me in an orphanage.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_4_6"><text>Ah... I didn't know.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_4_12"><text>You again? Remembering family?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_4_7"><text>Trying to.</text></string>

<string id="fake_rem_gg_5_0"><text>Can I have a word?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_5_11"><text>What?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_5_2"><text>Where you from? Tell me.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_5_3"><text>What are you, a prosecutor? Tell him...</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_5_4"><text>Don't be mad. You don't get it, I just have problems with my memory, so I'm looking for any clue. Maybe we're from the same city...</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_5_5"><text>I get everything. Walking around here, sniffing around: where from, where to... I'm from a village, not a city. Clear?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_5_6"><text>Clear... Sorry.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_5_12"><text>You again? Sniffing around?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_5_7"><text>Don't worry, I won't ask you about anything.</text></string>

<string id="fake_rem_gg_6_0"><text>Can I have a word?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_6_11"><text>What?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_6_2"><text>Haven't we met before? Well... in our city.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_6_3"><text>In ours? What city is that?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_6_4"><text>I thought you'd tell me. Where are you from, where were you born?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_6_5"><text>Where they birthed me, that's where I was born. And we haven't met before, neither in our city, nor in your village.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_6_6"><text>Don't want to talk... I'm not insisting.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_6_12"><text>You again? Found buddies from your village?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_6_7"><text>I'll find them, don't worry.</text></string>

<string id="fake_rem_gg_7_0"><text>Can I have a word?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_7_11"><text>What?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_7_2"><text>Just wanted to talk about life, remember different things.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_7_3"><text>Ah, you're the "memoryless" one? Always trying to remember something. So, how's it coming along?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_7_4"><text>Vaguely. Something seems to surface, but there's no certainty.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_7_5"><text>You should write it down for certainty. I started writing down my dreams too. Sometimes I dream such things, you might as well stand or fall. So I immediately write it fresh in my notebook. When I leave the Zone, I'll publish a book. "My impressions of the Zone", something like that... So you too - as soon as you remember something, straight to pencil.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_7_6"><text>I write sometimes. Just for myself, not for a book.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_7_12"><text>You again? Wrote down many memories?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_7_7"><text>Not much yet.</text></string>

<string id="fake_rem_gg_8_0"><text>Can I have a word?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_8_11"><text>What?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_8_2"><text>You got family? Wife, kids...</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_8_3"><text>Yeah, was married, very briefly. Split up right away. And I never saw the boy at all, she said he's mine, but she's not making claims and won't demand alimony. That's how it is. What about you?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_8_4"><text>Don't even know. Like there was a wife... or maybe not a wife...</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_8_5"><text>Common law? That's right. I got burned once, then only lived with women like that. Soon as she starts whining about "getting married", immediately - goodbye. I advise you too - soon as she starts nagging about legal relations, drop yours right away.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_8_6"><text>Clear advice... If only I knew who to drop.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_8_12"><text>You again? Still remembering your woman?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_8_7"><text>Remembering...</text></string>

<string id="fake_rem_gg_9_0"><text>Can I have a word?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_9_11"><text>What?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_9_2"><text>You often remember home?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_9_3"><text>Sometimes, especially when rain makes you feel so melancholy. All around dirt, dampness, stench, eating some canned food. But at home it's warm, cozy, smells like pies or hot borscht...</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_9_4"><text>Sometimes the smells here remind me of something. But just as I start sniffing around, it immediately slips away, can't catch it.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_9_5"><text>Start sniffing around too long here, someone will devour you. In this Zone everything only smells like death...</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_9_6"><text>Well I'm speaking generally... Alright, forget it.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_9_12"><text>You again? Remembering smells?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_9_7"><text>Trying...</text></string>

<string id="fake_rem_gg_10_0"><text>Can I have a word?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_10_11"><text>What?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_10_2"><text>Do you remember the school you studied at?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_10_3"><text>I studied at different ones. My father was military, so I didn't have time to get used to one school before moving to another.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_10_4"><text>And you remember all of them?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_10_5"><text>What do you mean all. I remember several more or less, some not very well, and some I don't remember at all.</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_10_6"><text>That's me too, I vaguely remember something like that. But mostly I don't remember at all...</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_10_12"><text>You again? Remembering school?</text></string>
<string id="fake_rem_gg_10_7"><text>Remembering as best I can...</text></string>

<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_101"><text>Hey, man. Sit down? You here for us or just passing through?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_102"><text>Hey, servicemen. What we guarding?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_103"><text>Just a transit point. Sometimes they bring scientists who study this infection. And we shine lights into the swamps so they don't get lost. You never know. Anyway, here we sit.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_104"><text>Hmm, not very cheerful. Tired of it?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_105"><text>Sick of it up to here! No decent food! Nothing to drink, radiation... Even though they give us pills, still - scary. You don't happen to have normal canned food or rations?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_106"><text>Well... What if I do? Why the hell should I feed servicemen?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_107"><text>Come on! We get it! We can throw in some ammo. Got plenty of that stuff for now. Look, rounds are piling up, they drop them from the chopper - but who to shoot at? It's quiet here...</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_1081"><text>Trading in ammo? Well, I got some spare provisions. What's the price list?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_1082"><text>Alright, if I need anything - I'll drop by.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_1091"><text>Great! You climb up the tower to Curly, he's trading now. You'll make a deal there.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_1092"><text>Drop by, or our bellies from what we have to eat have completely stuck to our spines...</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_201"><text>Hey, man. You here for us or just passing through? Got decent food with you?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_202"><text>Maybe I do. I'll look around first, think about it.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_kamp_dialog_203"><text>If you got some - let's trade? Our supply chief's up on the tower. Go up, have a talk.</text></string>

<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_101"><text>Oh! You got food? Got anything decent?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_1021"><text>Got food? Meaning?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_1022"><text>So you're the supply chief?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_1031"><text>Well... We make deals with guys - they give us decent food, canned goods and stuff, and we give ammo in exchange. Thought you knew, that's why you climbed up here. No?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_1032"><text>Not supply chief, just my turn on duty, and to watch the warehouse. So? Got anything to trade? Canned food, army rations?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_1041"><text>I'm just looking around. But since we're talking... How much will you give for canned food, and how much for sausage?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_1042"><text>You only take canned food and rations? What about sausage, for example?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_105"><text>That sausage of yours - screw it! Already the scientists... Barely saved one guy. We take canned food. At least it's made in a factory. For a can I'll give 5.45 armor-piercing rounds. For two - 7.62 ammo. And don't forget bread - a loaf for each can. And if you happen to get army rations, I'll throw in a pack of both calibers for a package. Just make sure it's whole, not opened.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_1061"><text>Here's a can with bread. Give me 5.45 rounds.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_1062"><text>Take a couple cans and loaves with them. That'll be 7.62 rounds from you.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_1063"><text>I got a ration pack, sealed. Will this work?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_1064"><text>Alright, I'm going. I'll drop by again if I get a chance.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_1071"><text>Well, thanks! Here, take the ammo. Need anything else?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_10511"><text>Hold on, let me check what other food I have left...</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_201"><text>Hello, you here about trading again?</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_202"><text>Hello, serviceman. Thought I'd ask...</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_203"><text>Need ammo, right? Then get ready with canned food or rations.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_2031"><text>If it's about ammo, we're all cleaned out for today. Come tomorrow - they should drop more.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_2032"><text>Alright, got it... See ya.</text></string>

<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_402"><text>I'm here with a package. Sherstyuk sent supplies.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_403"><text>Well I'll be! And we thought they forgot about us already.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_404"><text>They remember and really worry that you don't starve to death here. So take it. My back's already aching from carrying such weight.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_405"><text>Thank you. Take at least some ammo. Sorry, got nothing else to give.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_406"><text>Nothing else? If only they always thanked like this! Sherstyuk also told me to tell you that he knows about your little business, but hasn't reported to command yet. That's all, figure out the rest yourselves.</text></string>
<string id="mar_military_post_tower_dialog_407"><text>So that's where such generosity from that drunk comes from. Saw competitors in us, rear rat. No wonder stalkers are saying the captain from the pumping station's dealing ammo for rounds, and for foreign currency checks too. Sherstyuk's in on it with him, fact. And here we traded a couple packs for rations and we're already traitors to the motherland. Well, nothing, soon there'll be goods of completely different quality and quantity, both will wipe their tears, so come around. Just between us.</text></string>

<!-- -->
<string id="mar_mil_post_eco_start_dlg_101"><text>Hey, man! Interested?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_eco_start_dlg_102"><text>Yeah, something like that... What you studying?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_eco_start_dlg_103"><text>Can't explain just like that. For now I'm watching the equipment. And it does everything itself. During emissions different energy fluctuations are registered, everything's compiled and sent through relay retransmitters to our institute. And there they try to understand what came out.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_eco_start_dlg_104"><text>Why here, at the very border of the Zone? Closer to the center emissions are much stronger it seems... There you could probably collect more information, no?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_eco_start_dlg_105"><text>Much stronger emissions, seriously? Well I'll be! And the guys don't even know...\nJust kidding.\nAll that's understandable. But the data we get during emissions also needs to be sent where they can analyze it. Communications in the Zone are generally nonexistent, but here they work normally, though glitches happen sometimes. So it turns out that only from the outskirts is it possible to conduct systematic observations.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_eco_start_dlg_106"><text>Hmm, so you have constant communications here? Interesting... Alright, see ya, joker.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_eco_start_dlg_201"><text>Hey, man! Still wandering around?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_eco_start_dlg_301"><text>Ah, Marked One! How's things?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_eco_start_dlg_401"><text>Hello, friend Marked One. Alive and well?</text></string>

<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_start_dlg_0"><text>Yeah. A stalker, like a wolf, is fed by his legs. I was advised to turn to you here...</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_start_dlg_1"><text>To me? Curious. I'm listening.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_start_dlg_2"><text>You were telling how you have constant communications here with the mainland, right? I had trouble here - lost my memory. Don't remember who I am or where I'm from. Everyone calls me Marked One, but that's just a nickname. Someone whispered to me that you can get information about a person through fingerprint database. How, for real?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_start_dlg_3"><text>Ah... That's what you're about. Well, I have an acquaintance, works in law enforcement. In principle, we could try to run your fingers. But you understand - this is illegal business, who knows...</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_start_dlg_4"><text>I understand. I won't let you down! I'll pay up, however much needed.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_start_dlg_5"><text>Money? Cash, you mean? What good are they to me here? They'll kill me for them. Let's do it this way: favor for favor.\nYou correctly noted during our first meeting that emissions are stronger in the center of the Zone. So here's the thing, can you carry a special device to a point I'll indicate? When it starts working, after the next emission we'll start getting readings from it. And you'll get the results of the check, and I'll get materials for my dissertation. And we're even.\nSo? Deal?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_start_dlg_6"><text>And if I say "yes", then what? Let's be more specific.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_start_dlg_7"><text>Then I take your fingerprints right now and send them to my acquaintance. And I give you a device that needs to be installed in a small town, north of here. Limansk - that's its name. There the emission has sufficient force to manifest those properties, the study of which particularly interests me. Your job is just to install it, nothing more needs to be done. Everything's already configured, the device will start working automatically.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_start_dlg_8"><text>How will you take fingerprints and then transmit them? Not by radio.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_start_dlg_9"><text>That's no problem. We'll mix soot in oil, smear it and you'll press your fingers to a sheet of paper. Then I'll scan this thing and send it by email. Our internet's crappy, through satellite channel, only catches a couple hours a day, but for such a small thing it's quite enough.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_start_dlg_10"><text>I see. So you're saying I have to haul some gadget deep into the Zone? Let me think whether I'm ready to deal with this now.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_start_dlg_11"><text>Think, no problem. I'm here for a long time, my shift's just started, so to speak.</text></string>

<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_have_dlg_0"><text>I decided about that trip to Limansk. Basically, I agree, give me your device, I'll take it where needed.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_have_dlg_1"><text>Decided? Great! Here, take it. The device needs to be placed as high as possible to minimize interference effects. I looked at satellite images, there's one unfinished high-rise on a hill there. If you put it on the top floor - that'll be perfect. The device constantly checks its coordinates and is programmed to send a message to your PDA about starting work when it's installed in the right place.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_have_dlg_2"><text>Good. But what happens if I put it in the wrong place?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_have_dlg_3"><text>That's extremely undesirable! Some data will be obtained, of course, but not what's expected. And there's no second such device here. Getting one, theoretically, is possible, but by the time we order it, they review the request, approve it, find it, deliver it, and whether it's the right one needed... One hassle. Understand?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_have_dlg_4"><text>What's not to understand? Hope you won't try to make me sign a material responsibility contract?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_have_dlg_5"><text>Marked One, take this matter seriously, okay? As I said, everything's extremely simple: the device will send a signal about successful start of work to your PDA. If the message doesn't come, then the installation location was chosen incorrectly.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_have_dlg_6"><text>Alright, alright. Limansk, unfinished high-rise on a hill. I'll take it, even though it's heavy as hell, damn thing. And you do what you promised.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_have_dlg_7"><text>Of course, I have almost everything ready. So... Give me your right hand.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_have_dlg_8"><text>Hope I was fingerprinted out there, beyond the perimeter...</text></string>

<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_done_dlg_0"><text>Hey there, science. Everything seems alright, I hauled your iron coffin to Limansk. And an emission already passed since then. Got signal?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_done_dlg_1"><text>Yes! Works like clockwork. Tons of new material, will take a month to process, no less.\nAs for your matter...\nUnfortunately, your fingers weren't in the special services database. Either you were very law-abiding, or those fingers aren't yours, well or maybe you're from very far away. I asked my Lyubasha, she'll try to make an Interpol request, but that's not fast. If there's anything, I'll definitely let you know.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_done_dlg_2"><text>Damn! And I was hoping... All for nothing!</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_done_dlg_3"><text>Don't get upset, maybe it'll still clear up. Well, for the help, accept this from me, from a pure heart. Not much, of course, but it won't be unnecessary either, right? I can also share a recipe. I know, in your stalker community they're valued, right?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_done_dlg_4"><text>Yeah. Thanks. What did the device show at least, anything important? Didn't I break my back for nothing?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_done_dlg_5"><text>Too early to speak about results, but don't doubt - not for nothing, very much not for nothing. There's a hypothesis I've long wanted to confirm. Well, briefly if... How to say it simpler...\nEverything in the Zone changes, everything's subject to some periodic law. Events happen like waves, understand? They manifest themselves and fade away in waves just the same. Here, say, mutants, no, no and suddenly - like a wave washed them to shore. Ever notice?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_done_dlg_6"><text>Uh... Well, I've observed such things, yeah. Sometimes you get the impression they appear right out of thin air.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_done_dlg_7"><text>So that's a simple example. With emissions it's more complex. But their appearance is also not random and obeys the same law. It's cyclical action. What other example could I give? Here, breathing. Inhale-exhale. As if the Zone is a living being. Only "inhaling", the Zone absorbs not oxygen, but energy from our world. And it "exhales" not carbon dioxide, but some byproduct of its life activity. Here, those same mutants. Or anomalies. The point is that, according to people smarter than me, but with whom I completely agree, studying the cyclical nature of Zone phenomena can give the key to understanding how to "cut off the oxygen", isolating ourselves from the Zone's influence on our world.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_done_dlg_8"><text>Inhales, exhales... Someone already told me something like that, only there it was about something divine. Like the Zone breathes on us. Inhales - life, exhales - death. Or vice versa. Some kind of mysticism...</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_done_dlg_9"><text>Everything is born and dies, everything has cyclical nature. Even the universe has cycles of expansion and contraction. And, of course, theology has its explanations, and the scientific world has its own. But I see you caught the idea?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_scanner_done_dlg_10"><text>In the most general terms... Alright, I'm going.</text></string>

<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_check_dlg_0"><text>Hello-hello. As you see, still smoking the sky. I heard you seem to deal with energy problems, well... study fields, flows, something like that, right?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_check_dlg_1"><text>Something like that, uh-huh. Though some of my superiors think I'm wasting time and they've already hinted that if there are no positive results from my research soon, they'll cut the already meager funding.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_check_dlg_2"><text>Can you look at one thing for me? It's right up your alley. Maybe it'll be useful to you too. Well, for your research...</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_check_dlg_3"><text>Well-well. Show me, I'm even curious now.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_check_dlg_4"><text>Look. Here's a battery. It goes into... a special barrel, but that's not important. What's important is that such energy was accumulated in it that from one discharge it turned stones to dust. Now it's empty though. You, as an energy specialist, can you say if it's really possible to increase its capacity, and "fill it to full tank" at the same time?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_check_dlg_5"><text>I'm, by the way, a candidate of sciences, not a battery technician... Hmm, but interesting thing overall. Where'd you find such a thing? And you say, stones to dust? Unusual... compact... Interesting. Leave it for a while, I'll take a look.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_check_dlg_6"><text>Uh... well, alright, I'll leave it, but keep in mind: it's one of a kind. And it's not even mine. And since you got interested, what do you think, is it possible to make another one like this in Zone conditions, only so you could give several discharges with it. And even better, like in an automatic magazine... You understand the concept?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_check_dlg_7"><text>Trying to build pulse weapons? You're not the first, won't be the last. Hmm... but that's a thought! And just on topic... In short, I need time to study this product and figure out what can be done.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_check_dlg_8"><text>How long will that take?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_check_dlg_9"><text>If I start right now, then tomorrow I can give some specifics on your question.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_check_dlg_10"><text>Good. Then I won't interfere. I'll come by tomorrow or in a few days. Just please: don't break this thing!</text></string>

<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_0"><text>Came to check about the battery. Any progress?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_1"><text>Of course! The product turned out to have quite interesting internal construction. Unusual alternation of plates from rare earth element alloys. And the conductive gel-like medium contained inclusions of strange mineral. I think these are grains of anomalous formation group F, fine fraction. Though I might be wrong, but I think experiments will show...</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_2"><text>Stop! What does "internal construction" mean and why "contained"? What happened to the battery?! You broke it?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_3"><text>Why immediately broke? Disassembled into components. How else would I understand what it consists of and how it's made? I don't have X-ray here, only spectrometer. You wanted me to study it thoroughly: can another similar copy be made, can the capacity be increased, can an analog be created on this basis, as you put it, of an automatic magazine...</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_4"><text>Oh for crying out loud! That is, of course, yes, that's what I was interested in, but... Can't it be assembled as it was? What am I gonna tell Petrenko now?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_5"><text>Who's that, your accomplice? Customer? Partner?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_6"><text>What's the difference to you! Well, scientists! Like children - just give them something new, unusual, and they immediately spoil or break it. Yeah... my recipe's screwed. Alright, I'll say I gave it for study and that's it. Died, so it died.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_7"><text>Why are you so nervous? This is normal business - reverse engineering. Haven't heard of it? If there's no accompanying documentation for the product, then that's the only way to figure it out. Did your partner need this now-useless piece of iron or did he need data about how it's built and how to create something based on it?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_8"><text>You suggesting I tell him about what unusual innards this thing had? He'll be very happy learning about this. And in response he'll tell what a great recipe he had, but the paper it was written on tore - only scraps left. Like from the battery.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_9"><text>Stop dramatizing. There's good news too. I got interested in the device you brought and this topic in general. So by analogy I assembled from available materials... mmm... a laboratory model, experimental sample, if you will. It's, of course, somewhat unsightly and bulky, but we're not displaying it in a museum. Main thing is to make sure it works, and working on appearance can come after.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_10"><text>What are you getting at? You want to say this is a battery, of increased capacity... or power? Awfully big. Doesn't look like an automatic magazine either.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_11"><text>I said this is a test sample. It still needs to be perfected, but first we need to conduct an experiment and find out if it holds charge at all. Right now it's, as you probably guessed, completely discharged and can't be powered from regular 220 volt grid. That battery you brought... don't know how exactly they charged it, but to get similar effect here, in the Zone, we'll have to sweat.\nWe need an anomaly with open energy circuit. Won't bore you with theory and formulas, I'll say right away that there aren't very many such ones in the Zone. The closest one I know of is located in an area nicknamed by stalkers "Foggy Thicket". In the region of this anomaly, outflow of high-order energies is regularly observed. Sometimes this visually manifests as transparent figures floating in the air. In your environment they're called phantoms, if I'm not mistaken.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_12"><text>Foggy Thicket? Nasty place. Dragging this thing there... Listen, you're not pulling my leg? This is definitely a "test sample" and not an ordinary starter battery from some car? Because it looks like...</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_13"><text>I have nothing better to do than fool you. I repeat: don't pay attention to appearance. Just suitable form for this experiment - sealed non-conductive case, ability to install several plates, terminals... Couldn't find anything better. It weighs quite a bit, true, but still less than a regular battery.\nSo, will you undertake the experiment? If you don't know the way to Foggy Thicket, I'll show you the passage. And mark the place on the map.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_checked_dlg_14"><text>Just like that, off the bat, I'm not ready to answer. Need to figure some things out first...</text></string>

<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_have_dlg_0"><text>Basically, I'm ready to move to Foggy Thicket with the "test sample" you cobbled together.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_have_dlg_1"><text>Excellent. Take the product. Now let me mark in your PDA the place of energy flow concentration... Install the sample there, as close as possible to the energy anomaly. I think it should visually stand out on the terrain, orient yourself on it. Peak outflow of energies, by my calculations, should occur during emission. So, you leave the sample at the indicated point, and after the next emission passes, you take it and bring it back to me.\nDo you know the way to Foggy Thicket?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_have_dlg_21"><text>Yeah I know, won't get lost. Alright, see ya.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_have_dlg_22"><text>Well, tell me about the one you know, then I'll figure it out.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_have_dlg_3"><text>Here, from the Garbage side there's a path. I'll put a marker now...</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_have_dlg_4"><text>Got it. Alright, I'm off.</text></string>

<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_charged_dlg_0"><text>Phew... got tired dragging your homemade battery across half the Zone back and forth. Heavy, damn thing. Take it.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_charged_dlg_1"><text>Come on, half the Zone. Did everything as instructed?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_charged_dlg_2"><text>Yes. There's this big stone there, like colored glass. Phantoms circle nearby. Put it next to that, then took it after the emission. But you sure found a spot... Stuff constantly falling on your head, anomalies hitting from nowhere, plus those phantoms - wore my soul out completely.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_charged_dlg_3"><text>Strange place. But there wasn't much to choose from. Other options, I suppose, you'd hardly like more.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_charged_dlg_4"><text>Alright, that's all lyrics. What's next?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_charged_dlg_5"><text>Next I'll see what came out. And then I'll try to figure out if the sample can be refined to the level of practical field application.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_charged_dlg_6"><text>Uh... What do I tell Petrenko?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_charged_dlg_7"><text>Hold on with your Petrenko. I said - need to understand if we managed to charge the device or not. Whether we chose the right direction... Basically, walk around for an hour, then we'll continue the conversation.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_charged_dlg_8"><text>Keep in mind I'm not dragging this anywhere a second time. So calculate your direction accordingly.</text></string>

<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_done_dlg_0"><text>Already figured out the battery? Did it charge up near that stone?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_done_dlg_11"><text>Seems like everything went successfully! Instruments are detecting very high field intensity. That is, essentially - this is already a finished battery, charged with anomalous energy, similar to what was used in the original sample.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_done_dlg_12"><text>I'm still in the process. Don't breathe down my neck, okay?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_done_dlg_21"><text>Great! But you don't look satisfied...</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_done_dlg_22"><text>Alright, alright. I'll check in later.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_done_dlg_3"><text>How should I put it... Basically, the good news is that the energy concentration in this product is indeed enormous. And the bad news is that we still won't be able to use it. At least - not right now. Need to find a way to transform this energy into electrical and only then...</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_done_dlg_4"><text>No-no-no! I warned I'm not carrying this anywhere else, if that's what you're hinting at. Give me your theoretical calculations, experiment description, product blueprint and all that stuff. I'll take it to Petrenko, and then let him rack his brains about what to do with all this.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_done_dlg_5"><text>Wait. First, what will he understand from my calculations? Is he a scientist or engineer? And second, just think, Marked One: we're essentially opening a new chapter in Zone study right now! And I wouldn't want to just share my scientific research with anyone. I admit I have considerable hopes for... well, that's not important. And third, the final result hasn't been achieved yet. It might turn out that the sample will remain useless, even being pumped full of energy, but without the possibility of converting it to the kind we know how to control. But I already have an idea how we might try to accomplish the conversion...</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_done_dlg_6"><text>This doesn't concern me anymore. I didn't sign up to work as a lab assistant or pack animal. After all, you can contact Petrenko yourself and arrange to continue the experiments... or whatever else you've thought up. However it is - count me out.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_done_dlg_7"><text>I understand: urgent problems seem more important to you than any scientific work... Well, fine, maybe your Petrenko can perform the second part of the experiment? Himself or with someone's help. After all, he should be interested in this himself. Then you take him this container and my instructions, and then let him pass the results through someone... What a pity I can't just drop everything here! Especially since quarterly reports are coming up soon - what a hassle.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_done_dlg_8"><text>Give me the instructions, and let him come for this gadget himself. Or hire someone. I'll explain to him that you took the right direction, that everything's going great for you.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_done_dlg_9"><text>Alright. Here, I already jotted this down while you went to Foggy Thicket. In case you change your mind and decide to personally deliver the sample to Petrenko, I'm leaving it here. You can take it anytime. By the way, who is he exactly, this Petrenko? Or is it a secret?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_done_dlg_10"><text>What secret. He's from Duty's top brass. Everyone in Bar knows him. Now you can visit him yourself if needed.\nTime for me to go, stay healthy.</text></string>

<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_final_dlg_0"><text>Greetings to the workers of science! You won't believe it, but I'm here about the same business. And your laboratory sample... or whatever you called it, I got it with me, in short. Check what's there and how. Everything was done according to your notes.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_final_dlg_1"><text>Really! Well, well... Wow! Energy conversion definitely went successfully. And the charge - what a charge! Load fork overheats instantly and the device goes off the scale. Well, well! Honestly, I wasn't completely sure of success myself... Now we can sit down to real work. Just think how the topic developed!</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_final_dlg_2"><text>Enough clucking like a chicken over an egg. So you're saying everything's good? Now such accumulators can be mass-produced? And charged without problems, did I understand correctly? What about magazines, like automatic ones?</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_final_dlg_3"><text>What? Ah, you're still about pulse weapons. I think that in time this will be possible too. Main thing is there are no more gaps in the theoretical part, and the rest is a matter of technique.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_final_dlg_4"><text>That's great then. So I'll tell Petrenko you're thrilled and let him contact you, and then you figure out what to do with all this next.</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_final_dlg_5"><text>Yes, yes, of course. Though our goals are different, cooperation will benefit both me and him. What prospects, breathtaking!\nAnd to you, Marked One... I don't have anything valuable here, and don't know how to thank you. Except maybe some medicine. Here. Thank you!</text></string>
<string id="mar_mil_post_akkum_final_dlg_6"><text>Uh-huh, will come in handy. Gotta run. See ya.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_101"><text>Oh! Hey, Marked One. Still walking around, searching? Glad you're alive.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_102"><text>Hey there too. I see you changed your deployment location?</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_103"><text>Well, how should I put it... You probably heard they shut down the "Brain Scorcher"? Stalkers rushed there - to the center. They think there are piles of artifacts, untrodden places... idiots.\nSo we decided: "Duty" isn't just an organization, it's a way of life, a way of thinking. The leaders took the wrong path, got lost... Started thinking they ARE Duty. And everyone else should follow them blindly, like sheep. That's not right!\nNow we're here, in this place, trying to gather like-minded people ready to continue fighting the Zone's spawn.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_104"><text>So you split off? Who'll protect Bar? What about Borov and his gang? What if they return.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_105"><text>Borov took those who agreed to go with him. As I heard, they also headed to the center. Looks like they'll be shaking down stalkers there. As for the rest... Those who tried to stop us - they don't interfere anymore, others scattered, sitting somewhere in their holes. Though this scum can still bite if you let your guard down - so stay alert!\nRegarding Bar... You see, everything's rotten there. Duty was supposed to protect people from Zone infection, but that was only in words, in reality... They started profiteering! Everyone! Turned into just a "roof" for all kinds of underground schemes, for "their own" sales channels... Disgusting. Thought leadership would fill their pockets over time and calm down, but it kept getting worse and worse. So me and the guys decided not to deal with all this dirt anymore.\nWell... Alright, I'm rambling like an old man here. How are you? Remember anything about yourself? Found Strelok or someone else?</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_106"><text>Everything's normal. Memory's slowly returning, but sometimes I feel like it's not mine... By the way about Strelok. They say somewhere here, in the basement, there's a notable door. Don't you know? There's a tip that Strelok used to go through it to some underground rooms.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_107"><text>Door? There's a basement here, of course, maybe there is some door there, but... The entrance to the basement is blocked - sealed tight with concrete. And why someone needed to mess with this - can't figure out? Unless Borov's psychos committed some atrocities there and covered their tracks. Bastards! So... Consider there's no door.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_108"><text>No way! I was there, not long ago, in that basement. Maybe dig it out somehow?</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_109"><text>Dig it out... Only with dynamite. If you have some, then we'll solve this little problem.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_110"><text>Where would I get it?! Listen, you don't happen to know where to get dynamite?</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_111"><text>Heard that Wolf was messing with dynamite. Got some somewhere. Probably through Sidor. Who else?\nAsk Wolf yourself, if you find him, of course. Our Duty guys didn't have any, I know for sure - there was talk at one time. Nobody particularly wants to deal with explosives, who knows what might set it off, this is the Zone after all.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_1121"><text>Either Wolf or Sidor... Got it. See ya, we'll meet again.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_1122"><text>Either Wolf or Sidor... Yeah, also! You guys had a flamethrower. Won't you lend it? I've already been in the local basements, got experience... All kinds of nasty stuff flies around there, fries you with electricity.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_1132"><text>You say all kinds of nasty stuff flies around? What if you stir them up there and they try to get to the surface? No, Marked One, sorry, but we'll need the flamethrower ourselves.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_1142"><text>Well, that's reasonable. Alright, I'll manage somehow.</text></string>

<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_201"><text>Hey, Marked One. Maybe a hundred each? Or you're on business?</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_2021"><text>A hundred each? Hmm... Nah. In a bit maybe.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_2031"><text>Your call. I'll have a little drink maybe...</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_2022"><text>About the basement. I got explosives, how do I blow it up?</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_2032"><text>Well, got a remote detonator? No? Then advice - place the explosives roughly in the middle of the concrete, step back, and blow it with automatic fire. That'll be simplest...</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_204"><text>I'll try... Listen, maybe give me a couple fighters to help? Well, who knows what's behind that door.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_205"><text>Uh... I don't have free people, you understand - just settling in, up to our necks in work. But don't go too deep there, just take a look, if something serious comes up, get out right away...</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_206"><text>You're all the same! When it's time to share a hundred, everyone's here and ready. But when it's time to crawl into some... hole, suddenly everyone's "busy". At least post a sentry at the door, just in case. Who knows what's really behind that door. And maybe I'll have time to call for help if something happens.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_207"><text>Don't grumble, I'll post someone.</text></string>

<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_301"><text>You were going to the underground? Or changed your mind?</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_302"><text>Didn't change my mind, need to do something.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_401"><text>In one piece?! Glad for you. How was it there? Anything interesting?</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_402"><text>What's interesting there - dark, gassed, damp and stinks...</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_403"><text>What's it stink of, if it's gassed?</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_404"><text>Stinks of death, what else. Basically, you did right to close the entrance there. Something tells me I don't want to go there a second time.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_405"><text>Hmm... Should probably post two guards there, who knows... What if.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_406"><text>As you wish. But I don't advise going there. There's no place for people there.</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_commander_start_501"><text>Hello, friend Marked One.</text></string>

<string id="val_dolg_sub_commander_start_101"><text>Hmm... Familiar face, we've met I think. Marked One, right?</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_sub_commander_start_102"><text>Maybe we met. Can't remember everyone. Seems like at the checkpoint, at Garbage we met. What's here now?</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_sub_commander_start_103"><text>Yeah, exactly! Now we're here. It's quieter here. And in general...</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_sub_commander_start_104"><text>What "in general"?</text></string>
<string id="val_dolg_sub_commander_start_105"><text>Well, how should I put it... You probably heard they shut down the "Brain Scorcher"? Stalkers rushed there - to the center.

<string id="val_dolg_sub_commander_start_108"><text>Yeah, Strelok. That's why I came here. They say somewhere here, in the basement, there's a notable door. Don't you know? There's a tip that Strelok used to go through it to some underground rooms.</text></string>

<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_0"><text>There was word that you have dynamite...</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_1"><text>Well, people! Can't hide anything. I'll need to ask them to remind me where I stashed the valuable loot... Alright, I'm joking. What do you need dynamite for? Or is it a secret?</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_2"><text>No, not a secret really. Need to bring down a wall, can't get to the underground. Cautious thugs walled it up.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_3"><text>You're a risk-taker, I see. Well, work fears the master, as they say. I have explosives. Just not here, naturally. Only an idiot would drag dynamite here.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_4"><text>Why's that?</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_5"><text>Ha! The closer to the Zone's center, the emissions are - wow! Any explosives can blow up by themselves. Can't predict it. So I dropped the dynamite crate in a safer place for the time being. Figured if I need it - I'll pick it up then.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_6"><text>Well I'm not planning to store it. So what? Trade for something? What do you want?</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_71"><text>Trade, you say? Mmm... Basically, let's agree like this: I need a recipe for getting one artifact right now. Specifically - "Battery". Get me such a one, and I'll tell you where to stomp for the dynamite. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_72"><text>Trade, you say? Mmm... Basically, let's agree like this: I need a recipe for getting one artifact right now. Specifically - "Jellyfish". Get me such a one, and I'll tell you where to stomp for the dynamite. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_73"><text>Trade, you say? Mmm... Basically, let's agree like this: I need a recipe for getting one artifact right now. Specifically - "Springboard". Get me such a one, and I'll tell you where to stomp for the dynamite. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_811"><text>Oh! How lucky! I know this recipe. Write it down:\nArtifact "Battery" is obtained by joint transmutation in "Witch's Jelly" anomaly of bloodsucker tentacles and three artifacts. These are "Stone Blood", "Meat Chunk" and "Soul".</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_821"><text>Oh! How lucky! I know this recipe. Write it down:\nArtifact "Jellyfish" is obtained by joint transmutation in "Witch's Jelly" anomaly of cat tail, poltergeist eye, "Emerald Jellyfish", as well as regular "Jellyfish", but with completely positive properties.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_831"><text>Oh! How lucky! I know this recipe. Write it down:\nArtifact "Springboard" is obtained by joint transmutation in "Springboard" anomaly of artifacts "Thorn" and "Crystal Thorn" with exclusively positive properties, "Urchin" artifact and chimera claw.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_812"><text>Recipe, huh... Alright, I'll find out - I'll be back.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_91"><text>Hope it's no deception? Come on, don't frown. You proved you can be dealt with.\nSo here's the deal. You know Burnt Village in the Swamps? Well the one almost in the center of the Swamps. Yeah you know, don't scratch your head. I stashed the crate in the ruins of one of the houses. Don't know how to describe exactly which one. But there's not many there, you'll find it. Basically, I don't need this dynamite anymore, you can take it.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_92"><text>Hope it's no deception? Come on, don't frown. You proved you can be dealt with.\nSo here's the deal. You've been to the Sanatorium? Well the one near Cordon. I stashed the crate under one of the staircases there. Don't know how to describe exactly which one. But there's not many there, you'll find it. Basically, I don't need this dynamite anymore, you can take it.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_start_dialog_93"><text>Hope it's no deception? Come on, don't frown. You proved you can be dealt with.\nSo here's the deal. You'll have to stomp to the Gut. In the north, by the road that leads to Dark Valley, stands an old construction trailer, and several boulders nearby. Among them I stashed the crate. Basically, I don't need this dynamite anymore, you can take it.</text></string>

<string id="volk_dinamit_find_done_dialog_0"><text>Remind me, what recipe did you want for the dynamite?</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_done_dialog_71"><text>Memory problems? Ah, well, yes. I need to know how to cook "Battery". You owe me this recipe, and I'll explain where to stomp for the dynamite.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_done_dialog_72"><text>Memory problems? Ah, well, yes. I need to know how to cook "Jellyfish". You owe me this recipe, and I'll explain where to stomp for the dynamite.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_done_dialog_73"><text>Memory problems? Ah, well, yes. I need to know how to cook "Springboard". You owe me this recipe, and I'll explain where to stomp for the dynamite.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_done_dialog_811"><text>I found out this recipe. Write it down:\nArtifact "Battery" is obtained by joint transmutation in "Witch's Jelly" anomaly of bloodsucker tentacles and three artifacts. These are "Stone Blood", "Meat Chunk" and "Soul".</text></string>

<string id="volk_dinamit_find_done_dialog_812"><text>Yeah right, exactly... I'm being stupid.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_done_dialog_91"><text>Hope it's no deception? Come on, don't frown. You proved you can be dealt with.\nSo here's the deal. You know Burnt Village in the Swamps? Well the one almost in the center of the Swamps. Yeah you know, don't scratch your head. I stashed the crate in the ruins of one of the houses. Don't know how to describe exactly which one. But there's not many there, you'll find it. Basically, I don't need this dynamite anymore, you can take it.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_done_dialog_92"><text>Hope it's no deception? Come on, don't frown. You proved you can be dealt with.\nSo here's the deal. You've been to the Sanatorium? Well the one near Cordon. I stashed the crate under one of the staircases there. Don't know how to describe exactly which one. But there's not many there, you'll find it. Basically, I don't need this dynamite anymore, you can take it.</text></string>
<string id="volk_dinamit_find_done_dialog_93"><text>Hope it's no deception? Come on, don't frown. You proved you can be dealt with.\nSo here's the deal. You'll have to stomp to the Gut. In the north, by the road that leads to Dark Valley, stands an old construction trailer, and several boulders nearby. Among them I stashed the crate. Basically, I don't need this dynamite anymore, you can take it.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_dinamit_find_start_dialog_0"><text>I need explosives. Really bad.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dinamit_find_start_dialog_1"><text>Well, you're something! Explosives for him. And I don't want to look for my ass all over Cordon. Explosives in Zone conditions are extremely unstable.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dinamit_find_start_dialog_2"><text>Jacking up the price again? I know you already got dynamite for someone. So - how much?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dinamit_find_start_dialog_3"><text>Eh... I wanted to warn you for old friendship's sake. Well, you decide. I want two "dummy" class artifacts from you. And make sure they're in excellent condition. Bring them - you'll get dynamite.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dinamit_find_start_dialog_4"><text>You completely lost your mind, old miser? Such a price... I could trade these artifacts for a howitzer on the mainland.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dinamit_find_start_dialog_5"><text>Do you need that howitzer in the Zone? No? Then don't chirp. Though, I really did go a bit overboard. Agree to accept slightly worn artifacts, if you want.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dinamit_find_start_dialog_61"><text>Yeah right, so lucky... Here, I just happen to have dummies with me, take them. When will there be explosives?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dinamit_find_start_dialog_62"><text>Just an attraction of unprecedented generosity. You'll get your dummies, old miser.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dinamit_find_start_dialog_7"><text>Let's see... Yeah, these'll do. Come back in half an hour, they'll drag it over.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_dinamit_find_done_dialog_0"><text>So, what about the dynamite?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dinamit_find_done_dialog_11"><text>What-what! Wait for now. The courier hasn't returned yet.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dinamit_find_done_dialog_12"><text>The courier returned from the military. Don't know what they need dynamite dropped off for periodically, but for your luck, they're ready to part with a couple dozen kilos without much "persuasion". What are you standing for? Go, take it. They put it in the first house from the road, not dragging it here. Run before someone makes off with it. People here are crafty.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_dinamit_find_done_dialog_2"><text>I'll make off with them...</text></string>

<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_0"><text>Sidorovich, can you sell products wholesale?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_1"><text>What? What is this, a grocery warehouse?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_2"><text>Come on. Canned meat, for example, isn't delivered to you one can at a time. Surely several boxes at once. Can you sell me about 30 cans at once? And some other stuff too, preferably with a discount, so to speak... for wholesale.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_3"><text>I had a feeling there was something about you. Decided to go into business? Watch out, Marked One, you'll go broke. And if you don't go broke yourself, you'll help others. Heh-heh.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_4"><text>I'm not planning to sell this. I need 30 cans of stew, 30 loaves of bread, 20 cans of energy drinks and vodka, 10 bottles for one job. Doesn't matter to you if you sell piece by piece or all at once? And I'll take everything at once - obvious benefit to you from such commerce. Even with a discount.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_5"><text>No, there's definitely something about you. You're not circumcised by any chance? Look how you started talking: "benefit", "commerce", "discount". And what price you planning to take it for?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_6"><text>I think for such a large order you could knock off 20%.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_7"><text>What?! Want to completely fleece me?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_8"><text>So, as I understand, we have a deal?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_9"><text>Alright, you convinced me, you'll get everything... wholesale. And with a discount, so be it, but 15%\nOnly I have a counteroffer for you: so you definitely take everything, no tricks - thought and changed your mind.\nFor urgency and wholesale you'll throw in a simple artifact on top.\nArtifact up front. Got it?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_101"><text>Could've knocked off more. Here's an artifact.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_102"><text>You'll get your artifact. In a bit.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_103"><text>Forget you! I'll gather it myself somehow.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_11"><text>Marked One, can't go any lower. Or do you want stalkers to find out why I'm holding back goods and not selling to them?\nBasically, drop by in half an hour. Need to check the warehouse.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_find_start_dialog_12"><text>Deal, I'll swing by.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_opt_food_have_dialog_0"><text>About wholesale products, is the deal still on?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_have_dialog_1"><text>Pay the advance. Then we'll do our little business.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_have_dialog_21"><text>Yeah, here's an artifact, when to expect it?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_have_dialog_22"><text>Yes-yes, I remember, but no artifacts yet.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_have_dialog_31"><text>Come by in half an hour. Need to check the warehouse.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_have_dialog_41"><text>I'll run by, won't forget.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_opt_food_already_dialog_0"><text>About the products, did you collect them?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_already_dialog_11"><text>Marked One! When were you told? Head problems again?</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_already_dialog_12"><text>Collected, got all sweaty. Phew...\nLet's settle up first? You owe... So... With the discount... Exchange rate difference... Hmm... Plus fees... Total... Fifty tw... fifty-five thousand rubles, zero zero kopecks. You'll ruin me, by God you'll ruin me.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_already_dialog_21"><text>Come on, come on! Can't even ask.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_already_dialog_22"><text>Fifty-five thousand?! Alright, deduct it.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_already_dialog_23"><text>I'll rummage in my coffers, maybe I'll gather the needed sum.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_opt_food_already_dialog_32"><text>I asked too little... What won't you do for a good person.\nTake it.\nAnd remember my kind heart!</text></string>

<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_103"><text>We are island. Fragment of great. Part of common. Essence - shells, separated from soul... From Great mind of universe. From Awareness of all existing...</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_104"><text>Head's starting to hurt... I asked like a human: what should I call you?</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_105"><text>We are not humans. We are higher and purer. We are mind! But for now, at this stage, we are bound to flesh. And this flesh has mark - Reaching Lazurite. Your mind is covered by veil, what is your mark?</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_106"><text>Mark? This about tattoo? Ah! You mean my name? They call me Marked One, maybe you know?</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_107"><text>Mark Marked One is known to us... Are you that one? One of those? You are needed by enlightened. Accept assignment and fulfill prescribed as we all do!</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_108"><text>Stop, stop! What's this about? What assignment? What are you talking about? I didn't ask for any assignment. I was told to do something here and they promised a reward.</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_109"><text>There is message. Was. From Existing. One who bears Mark will come. Will be able to receive what he thirsts for. And will bring understanding. Need to direct... No communion at this moment of time flow. Need transponder. You can make. Then will be communion. Will be replenishment. Will be direction... You, Marked... Take seed. Carry to place. Leave. It will sprout. Then will be communion and... Reward.</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_110"><text>What "seed"? What "place"? What "reward"? What is this even? Why?</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_111"><text>Seed. His. Will give possibility of mind unity. If will be sown in points... In needed...</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_112"><text>Why don't you "sow" it here? And generally, you'd do it yourselves. Your seeds, you sow them.</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_113"><text>Not here. Need there... near Him. We can no longer return... We lose connection with Him. It strives from here to distance. It extends attention further... It does not look nearby. We must go after It. Cannot lose connection for long... But seed is needed for Him there. Those with mark can do. They are not bound to Him strongly like us... You can return.</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_114"><text>Wait, wait... Brrr! "It" goes there... somewhere there from here. And you must go after it... on a leash like. Is that it? So why are you here then, and not following "it" there... I'm getting confused already.</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_115"><text>We wait. Here is connection through His sprout. He is near. Here is His breath... He needs more such... For this seed.</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_116"><text>What? So somewhere here already sprouted something like that... A sprout from it?</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_117"><text>Yes. Long ago. You are on path of understanding... Analogy is appropriate... Was seed, It sprouted... It received energy... But this is not important. One is few... It needs more. Now need more... Such as you can. You do not need His attention, like us. But you are also with His seal, It will let through. You are Marked, it will let you through.</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_118"><text>What am I marked with?! What seal?</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_119"><text>It will tell. You will understand everything with Him. Who you really are. Do not waste time. Strive to Him.</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_120"><text>Alright... What the hell. If there's a chance to understand something... What seeds and where to plant?</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_121"><text>Places of energy. Flows. Exit points... His sprouts. You call these places "Matrices". Take...</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_122"><text>Those are like anomalies... And generally, depends where to carry them still. I haven't decided yet.</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_123"><text>You, humans, say "District Center", there. You will be able. Leave seed... And you call "Tesla". Leave there... And you say "Radar". Leave. And plant... Take. Seed is alive. It will not die. In right place will sprout... At right time. Do not wait. Time itself will come.</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_124"><text>Oh, damn... Well I don't know... Your seeds are heavy. I'll think about it. And I need to drop my little seed somewhere here or in neighboring chamber - small beacon. Don't mind? \nAnd this... if I lose them, or someone steals them suddenly, or I sell them - who knows what need might arise - so what then? Back to you again?</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_1241"><text>Oh, damn... Well I don't know... Your seeds are heavy. I'll think about it. \nAnd this... if I lose them, or someone steals them suddenly, or I sell them - who knows what need might arise - so what then? Back to you again?</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_125"><text>Cannot lose... Do what must be done. There will be no others.</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_126"><text>How complicated everything is with you... Why does "it" give so few seeds? Don't you mind parting with such rarity?</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_127"><text>Not few... But by your time measures process is long. In this time segment there are none. Seed is always. Will not run out. But later. Much.</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_128"><text>Yeah, "it" is in no hurry. It has eternity ahead... Well alright, but if I do plant your seeds, so what? Look for you here again?</text></string>
<string id="aver_monolith_glavn_start_dialog_129"><text>No. Will not be already... Go to place Pripyat. Connector will inform when. He is still there, he is in contact with It. He will understand from It what you did. He will call you and give His reward...</text></string>

<string id="tushgenerator_dialog_0"><text>I see - training a tushkano?</text></string>
<string id="tushgenerator_dialog_1"><text>Training? You mean our Gena?</text></string>
<string id="tushgenerator_dialog_2"><text>Gena? I mean the tushkano in the wheel...</text></string>
<string id="tushgenerator_dialog_3"><text>Well yeah... I'm saying - Gena... It's from the word "generator". Hunters gave him to us. Along with the wheel. They used to use him to recharge their batteries, and some other small stuff. They had one "trainer", but he died, and they felt sorry for Gena. So they gave him to us. There he is, running... After sausage... Also spins the generator. We don't give him much food so he doesn't get lazy... Just don't stick your fingers near him, or he'll bite off your whole hand. He's not friendly, even though he's "trained".</text></string>

<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_101"><text>Who? Oh! It's you! Hello. How's life?</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_102"><text>Hey! I thought you were already home eating mama's pies. What brings you here?</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_103"><text>Yeah, I was thinking, what's there to do back home? Watch my drunk stepfather again? I'm thinking of heading to the city, to Kharkov. But I need money for the start. So the guys advised me to do some stalking. They introduced me to Sidorovich. He gave me this PDA to transfer money. And advised me not to go deep at first, just look around here. So I'm looking around. Already found my first artifact!</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_104"><text>Aren't you scared? A stalker's life isn't sugar.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_105"><text>Honestly? I'm scared. But you gotta live. Back there, beyond the cordon, to earn this kind of money you'd have to slave away for years or steal. And I don't want that. Maybe some other guys from our village will agree, we'll go together. Then we can go deeper into the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_106"><text>Why didn't you attach yourself to someone experienced?</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_107"><text>Nah. They told me how experienced stalkers use rookies. Like for checking the road. I don't want that. Maybe not right away, but I'll study anomalies and mutants. And there'll be money and artifacts. At least I'll only depend on myself. And I can always leave for the mainland. No rush. It's a shame I lost a year on that service... Like I erased it. Not even a memory left.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_1081"><text>Memory, yeah! Ah! I found a photo album once, a demobilization one.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_1082"><text>Yeah, memory is important. I should know... Good luck, Sanya.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_1092"><text>Thanks. Good luck to you too. Maybe we'll see each other again.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_109"><text>Yeah? What kind of album? I had a buddy in the platoon, he made a really good album. There were photos of me and other guys in it. But he died, not so long ago. They sent them to clean out a sewer. A major from headquarters flew in and gave the order. That's when me and Vovchik split. Just to be safe. Well, and Seryoga, as I heard, never came back from there.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_110"><text>I found that album in the sewer at Agroprom.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_111"><text>Can I take a look? Maybe it's Seryoga's?</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_112"><text>Let's see. If it's still in one piece, I'll bring it. Alright, see you later.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_113"><text>Thanks... Good luck to you too.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_201"><text>How are you doing? Alright? Well, good...</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_202"><text>Yeah, everything's fine. You still hanging around here?</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_203"><text>Yeah, getting used to it slowly. I look around during the day, settle in here for the night. I usually get back by midnight. It's scary to wander at night, but it's quiet and peaceful here.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_2041"><text>I brought you that demobilization album as I promised.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_2042"><text>Alright, got it. Well, stay healthy, soldier.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_2052"><text>Yeah, stay healthy yourself, stalker.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_2051"><text>Yeah! Yes, it's Seryoga's. Here I am with him, see? And this one's from boot camp - here's Kostyan with our dog, with Beer. You really helped me out! Can I keep it?</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_206"><text>So where's the beer?</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_207"><text>Beer? Ah! You mean the photo? That's the dog's name - "Beer". When you call him, everyone's heart rejoices: "Beer - come here!"... So what? At least a couple photos?</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_208"><text>"Beer"? Funny... Alright, keep it, I don't need this album anyway. I need to find my own memory.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_209"><text>Thanks, friend. Take some ammo at least... that's all I have.</text></string>
<string id="dsk_sanek_start_dialog_301"><text>Hello, friend. I've already gotten some artifacts! What about you?</text></string>

<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_101"><text>Greetings! How's life? I see the Zone has roughed you up pretty bad.\nShall we get acquainted?\nMy name is Ivantsov. Rank - Colonel. I'm General Voronin's deputy for operational matters. Let me explain - operational means deputy for direct supervision of Duty's main business: forceful cleanup of Zone spawns and all elements disrupting the established order! Clear?\nWhat should I call you?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_102"><text>Marked One. I'm looking for Strelok or Ghost. Haven't heard of them?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_103"><text>Marked One? Hmm... There were rumors about Strelok at one time, though that was long ago - more than six months back. And Ghost showed up recently, seems like he headed to Yantar. The scientist, Vasilyev, offered him well-paid work, as far as I know. That's about all... I know.</text></string>

<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_201"><text>Marked One, why so gloomy? Did you find what you were looking for, or still searching?</text></string>

<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_301"><text>Marked One! It's you... There was a rumor - you've already combed through the whole Zone? You're an interesting person. I'll keep you in mind, if something comes up.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_302"><text>And you collect rumors too, Colonel?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_303"><text>Everything interests me. Sometimes there's more truth in those rumors than in official papers.</text></string>

<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_401"><text>Marked One, good thing you came. I was just thinking about you... Since you take on all kinds of jobs. There's one assignment, not too difficult, but important!</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_402"><text>Not difficult, but important... Something gives me bad feelings about this.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_403"><text>Nothing special. I heard you're heading toward Army Warehouses? Eh?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_404"><text>Hmm... Seems like nothing can be hidden from anyone here! So - what's the job?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_405"><text>We have one group at the Warehouses right now. Need to tell them the assignment is cancelled and they should act according to code twenty-nine. Say that thirteen and eight are out of the game. Well? Doesn't seem complicated?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_406"><text>And who should I tell? What nonsense, eight, twenty, three - fifteen. Like children, honestly...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_407"><text>This is important! You need to tell Major Cherepanov. He should be with the group at the southern hamlet near the warehouses. And the numbers mean what they mean. You'd better not think too hard about such things - you'll be safer. Deliver the message quickly and come straight back with a report. Well, how about it? Do you remember what to say?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_408"><text>Uh... Code twenty-nine, thirteen and eight are out. Something like that.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_4091"><text>Exactly! Alright, go do it! Wait, don't do it yet! There's another thing: our general was looking for a volunteer. He has one delicate little assignment, also at Army Warehouses. If you're interested, go see him. Only I didn't tell you this. Got it?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_4092"><text>Exactly! Alright, go do it!</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_501"><text>You still here? Time doesn't wait! The matter is very urgent.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_601"><text>How are things? Everything alright?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_651"><text>Hello, Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_701"><text>Marked One, holy hell... Alive?!</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_702"><text>You bet! I'll outlive all of you... What's this all about, suddenly?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_703"><text>Where have you been all this time? I wanted to throw you some work, but someone said they saw you head to Radar. A week goes by without you, then two already. We figured that was it... We even discussed - hopefully it was quick, without suffering, and not like the other inhabitants there. But you're alive... Damn! How did you manage to last two weeks there?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7041"><text>Two weeks? Damn! For me it was like one day. I can't understand anything myself, I thought it was just something with my PDA, or my watch was off, but then I look - Bar is empty, like a lot of time really passed. Where's your general? How do I get to the storage room?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7051"><text>Well here's the problem, stalker. There's nothing left in your storage room. I understand they freed it up... completely.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7061"><text>What?! What does this mean?! Everything I earned! All gone to hell?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7071"><text>Without going into details... yes. Many fell under the corrupting influence of greed. The Zone reshaped them in its own way. Unfortunately, our general was among them. Now it seems like I'm in command here. So come to me.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7081"><text>Yeah... who would have thought. About the storage room. Can I still leave loot here?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7091"><text>Uh, Marked One, look around more carefully! What do you see? Or, let's say more precisely, what do you NOT see? Few real fighters left. So now there's no way to ensure one hundred percent guarantees for the safety of any valuables. So, sorry...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7010"><text>And where am I supposed to go now?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7011"><text>I heard someone at the bar takes things now. Not for free, of course...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7012"><text>I need to check my stash here one last time. Can I?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7013"><text>Such a non-believer. Go, look.</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7042"><text>Two weeks? Damn! For me it was like one day. I can't understand anything myself, I thought it was just something with my PDA, or my watch was off, but then I look - Bar is empty, like a lot of time really passed. Where's your general?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7052"><text>Without going into details... Many fell under the corrupting influence of greed. The Zone reshaped them in its own way. Unfortunately, our general was among them. Now it seems like I'm in command here. So come to me.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7062"><text>Yeah... who could have thought. By the way, since your leadership changed here, and as you put it, those who fell under the influence of greed scattered, can I leave loot with you for storage?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7072"><text>Uh, Marked One, look around more carefully! What do you see? Or, let's say more precisely, what do you NOT see? Few real fighters left. So now there's no way to guarantee the safety of other people's property. If only our own stuff doesn't get stolen...</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7082"><text>And where should I store loot now, maybe you can advise?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_7092"><text>I heard someone at the bar takes things now. Ask Barkeep.</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_801"><text>Greetings. What brings you here?</text></string>
<string id="bar_dolg_ivancov_start_901"><text>How are things? Everything alright?</text></string>

<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_0"><text>I talked to that major of yours...</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_1"><text>Did you deliver the order? Any details?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_21"><text>Well, what details... I told him your children's counting rhyme. He told me another one. Something about sevens.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_22"><text>Well, no special details... I delivered what I was told, and he said he understood everything and rattled off other numbers in response. Seven and seventy-five... I think.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_31"><text>Be more specific. What exact numbers did Major Cherepanov give you? How we finish this business depends on it.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_32"><text>Seventy-five? Are you sure? This is important! And how we finish our business depends on it.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_41"><text>Uh... Seven for sure. And then... Seventy-seven, maybe... Or no?! Something with seventy - definitely. But what came after... slipped my mind.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_42"><text>Uh... Seven it was. And then... Something with seventy - definitely. But what exactly... slipped my mind.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_51"><text>Seventy-six? Seventy-two?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_52"><text>Why are you getting so worked up, Marked One? Try to remember! Not seventy-two? Maybe seventy-six?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_61"><text>Right! Exactly! Seventy-two! I even thought about a certain double-barrel...</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_62"><text>Uh... seems like it was still seventy-five after all.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_71"><text>Fine. I understand not to expect much from an ordinary stalker. Good. Let's consider the assignment successfully completed. Here, take some supplies from me. If needed - can I count on you in the future?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_72"><text>Hmm... very strange if so. This code is only used in case of... well, that's not important. Good. Let's consider the assignment successfully completed, even though there's some nonsense with the response. You're confusing something, stalker... Though it's understandable for you, with your head problems. Here, take some supplies from me. If needed - can I count on you in the future?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_81"><text>We'll see. How the chips fall. Thanks for the supplies though.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_cherep_return_dialog_82"><text>We'll see. How the chips fall.</text></string>

<string id="borov_limansk_start_dialog_101"><text>Oh! You're the Marked One? Didn't think I'd see you...</text></string>
<string id="borov_limansk_start_dialog_102"><text>Yeah, I thought too that... Well, let's not talk about sad things.</text></string>
<string id="borov_limansk_start_dialog_103"><text>Did you want something or just passing by?</text></string>
<string id="borov_limansk_start_dialog_104"><text>Didn't expect to see you with... the boys here. Just came to say hello. You've come pretty far though.</text></string>
<string id="borov_limansk_start_dialog_105"><text>No farther than others. Alright, if you don't have business with me, then get going, I was just about to have some tea.</text></string>
<string id="borov_limansk_start_dialog_201"><text>You again, Marked One? What did you want?</text></string>

<string id="borov_lim_quest_start_dlg_0"><text>Don't think I'm prying into your secrets, just got curious: why did you move here from the Valley?</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_start_dlg_1"><text>Curious, damn him. The prosecutors were curious too, how papa Borov kept getting away from raids... Ah, what secrets are there, think with your head. Stalkers rushed north when word spread that the brain burner at Radar stopped working. Everyone thought they'd be hauling artifacts by the cartload from the center of the Zone, but hell, nothing doing. We're hanging around here pointlessly. Stalkers still go in that direction more or less, but damn few come back - maybe two or three a day, and those are mostly without loot and all beaten up somehow. Or maybe we chose a bad spot here, are there any bypass routes, eh, don't you know, Marked One?</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_start_dlg_2"><text>Seems like there's only one road from here to the Forest. And there, beyond the bridge, by the way, your "colleagues" also set up a post. They watch to make sure no stalkers accidentally strain themselves under the weight of loot. Help them get rid of excess...</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_start_dlg_3"><text>Colleagues? You talkin' about Bold's crew? Then it'd be more accurate to say - competitors. That bastard didn't wanna go under Borov, doesn't respect the authorities, and generally doesn't honor the thieves' code. Wanted to drag him to a sit-down, to sort out all issues properly, but he sent my boys back on their asses when they brought him my message, even took their guns and generally mocked them like some last punk. Should waste the bastard, but quietly, so it doesn't trace back to us. I heard some serious people stand over him too. And so what, plenty of lawless scum wanders around the Zone... Someone slashed a throat with a razor over suddenly arising personal dislike, and that's it. What do you say, Marked One, don't you wanna do a good deed? I bet you yourself constantly suffer losses from these twerps?</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_start_dlg_4"><text>Well, sure, that's true, but I already told you: I don't do wet work.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_start_dlg_5"><text>Yeah, yeah, you said that. Alright, I'll find my own way to deal with this bastard. He won't be showing off much longer.\nAnd you know what... You're gonna head back through the forest from Limansk later, right? Drop by Bold if you don't mind, and tell him Borov offers one last time to settle our differences peacefully. Either he sends a parla... parme... fuck... parliamentarian here, or let him get ready to try on a wooden mackintosh. If you act as an ambassador of good will with an answer yourself, that's even better. I don't trust Bold's gang. I'll give you a decent bonus, don't worry, you know me.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_start_dlg_6"><text>Just deliver a message and come back with an answer if there is one? I can do that, why not.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_start_dlg_7"><text>Well, good on you. Just don't forget. I'll wait for an answer three days, then I'll start stirring up trouble. Alright, shake hands and get going, I still gotta think about where to get grub now.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_start_dlg_8"><text>I'll be back in three days for sure. By the way, isn't Veins your supply chief? And where is he anyway, I haven't seen him here? I might've traded something with him.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_start_dlg_9"><text>Veins went to shit, our paths diverged. So forget about trades.</text></string>

<string id="borov_lim_quest_done_dlg_0"><text>About your request to deliver a message to Bold...</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_done_dlg_1"><text>Well? What's the word?</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_done_dlg_21"><text>The proposal... uh... was rejected... uh... in a rude manner. And I was also told that your people shouldn't appear nearby anymore, or they'll be wasted. That's almost a direct quote.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_done_dlg_22"><text>The answer is in this box. As far as I know, there's a very needed artifact inside and a note from Bold. Generally, it all looks like he agreed to settle your differences peacefully. Details, I think, are laid out in the note.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_done_dlg_23"><text>The answer is in this box. As far as I know, there's a very needed artifact inside and a note from Bold. But... I'd open it very carefully if I were you. I don't have concrete evidence, and I don't want to badmouth Bold, but the whole story about sending a package seemed suspicious to me.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_done_dlg_24"><text>We had a little squabble with Bold, so much that he's not breathing anymore. I mean completely. Turns out your original proposal about his... hmm... elimination was carried out unplanned. That's how it happened.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_done_dlg_25"><text>Nothing yet. Just wanted to say that I'm about to head to Red Forest. There'll be news soon.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_done_dlg_31"><text>Well, that's it. Pushkin finished writing, Gagarin finished flying, and this punk... I got no beef with you, Marked One, you did your job. Take this decent artifact as payment, one scrawny guy "shared" it. Says it's extra for him, ha-ha!\nWell, good luck to you, wanderer.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_done_dlg_32"><text>What, really? Sent an artifact, you say? Strange, but alright. I'll look later... without prying eyes. You did everything clean, Marked One. Take your payment, one scrawny guy "shared" it.\nWell, good luck to you, wanderer.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_done_dlg_33"><text>Your gut works well, seems like. What's this "very needed artifact" bullshit?! There's clearly some fuckery here... We had one snitch attach himself to us recently, I'll give him this little box to open. And you're a real beauty, Marked One, did everything proper. Take your payment, one scrawny guy "shared" it.\nYeah, this should interest you. I had the boys figure out approaches to Bold's place. They mined the bridge, you probably know. But disabling them is easy as pie. Kolsha, sharp head, managed to get close and spy how the gatekeeper at the bridge did it when he was letting a stalker through. He pretends to press some buttons there, but actually switches an inconspicuous lever with his foot in the ventilation recess at the base of the console. Real sneaky type.\nWell, good luck to you, wanderer.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_done_dlg_34"><text>Fo' real? Now that's what I call performance, Marked One. Well, may the earth be glass wool to him, as they say, and all that. Take this decent artifact as payment, one scrawny guy "shared" it. Says it's extra for him, ha-ha!\nYeah, this should interest you. I had the boys figure out approaches to Bold's place. They mined the bridge, you probably know. So if the mines are still armed, disabling them is easy as pie. Kolsha, sharp head, managed to get close and spy how the gatekeeper at the bridge did it when he was letting a stalker through. He pretends to press some buttons there, but actually switches an inconspicuous lever with his foot in the ventilation recess at the base of the console. Real sneaky type.\nWell, good luck to you, wanderer.</text></string>
<string id="borov_lim_quest_done_dlg_4"><text>Much obliged.</text></string>
<string id="tex_borov_lim_quest_article"><text>Borov from Limansk wants to send a message through me to Bold in Red Forest. If possible, I should also deliver the return answer. Seems like a trivial matter at first glance, considering I have three whole days to complete it.</text></string>
<string id="st_borzyi_borov_quest_stats"><text>In the thick of bandit showdowns</text></string>

<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_101"><text>Good luck to the suit! Ah... it's you. What was your handle again? Marked One, right? Look where you ended up. Usually only bros hang out here.</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_102"><text>All familiar faces around Limansk. I remember you and your crew were gonna tear claws far from Borov's authority. So, how is it? Breathing freely now?</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_103"><text>Why you grinnin'? You know that bastard came here too. Someone should put him on a knife already. Maybe I wouldn't become the boss instead of him, but I'd sure move up.</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_201"><text>You're coming around too often. Trying to join the crew? Nah, I'm kidding, kidding... Otherwise look, we took out almost all the small fry...</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_2021"><text>Listen, why'd you guys fo' real set up shop right next to Borov's people? What's the point of pushing elbows here? Should've moved somewhere else.</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_2022"><text>Oh, these vagrant problems again.</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_203"><text>It's his gang that came here, my bros have been hanging around here for a long time. But you're right though, there's nothing to catch here anymore. We even figured out where to set up a new place, but it's all pointless for now. We managed to heat up some loot from your colleagues here, see. Great stash it'll be if we can unload the goods to dealers near the perimeter. But we still gotta haul it there somehow. Carrying it on our backs is really tough, and stashing it somewhere here and dragging it piece by piece is sketchy. Borov's snitches will sniff it out, then we might end up with nothing but our bare asses... You're a smart guy, know all kinds of stalker tricks. Got any advice?</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_204"><text>Nah, you'll figure something out yourselves. Or you won't. I don't really give a shit.</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_205"><text>Hold on there. Why so prickly? I'm not asking just like that. Help out - we'll settle up. I got interesting info from the eggheads. Definitely gonna be worth your while.</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_206"><text>Yeah? Well then catch this idea: get an exoskeleton. It's like a special suit. Lets any weakling carry tons of heavy stuff once he puts it on. Now tell me your interesting info.</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_207"><text>We grabbed an egghead with the boys recently. One was walking all the way from District Center, imagine that? Like, gonna restock supplies at Mikhalych's. Yeah, we know those supplies - they're called booze. Anyway, there was really nothing to take from him, was gonna stock up on credit, so we decided to check what's in his tablet. And there's a real story about a whole klondike of artifacts written there, I tell ya. All chewed out in detail, what and how, with all their scientific bullshit. But the thing is... It's in such a place that we won't go check it out, no question. But you're different. For experienced stalkers like you, that's easy as pie.</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_208"><text>Uh-huh. Look how he's singing like a nightingale! Is this klondike at the Chernobyl plant or what? Maybe you'll even point out a shortcut there?</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_209"><text>Uh... so you already figured it out? Or just randomly hit the... sky? Here's the deal: I'll explain everything about this topic if you bring me and the boys an exoskeleton, the one you just mentioned. Brand new, unfucked with, and it's gotta suit us spades. We won't take anything from the "reds", that's beneath us, got it? I heard Borov's torpedoes dressed up in those little suits. Maybe you can get one from someone else in the brotherhood. You figure it out. So, good deal? Just think how much you'll lift there, from this klondike. For a tip like this, even two exos wouldn't be too much, eh?</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_2101"><text>Whoa whoa! Slow down! I'll try to hustle one somehow, so be it. Really wanna touch one of the Zone's most famous legends. If all this isn't bullshit, of course...</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_2102"><text>Whoa, hit the brakes! Stop loading me like some last sucker. Some people never learn. Watched too many American movies or greed's blowing your roof off... Ah, what's the point of feeding you our stalker sayings...</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_301"><text>So, how's it with the exo?</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_3021"><text>Got it. Had to haul plenty of heavy stuff myself, but I'm used to that by now. Here. Now tell me about the klondike, and make sure it's detailed.</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_3022"><text>Still empty-handed.</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_303"><text>Now you delivered, eh! No, fo' real, you brought us such a score? You're a solid guy in life, no question! So listen up, I'll explain about the klondike like to family.\nThat science guy turned out to be talkative. Just acted smart at first, but we quickly straightened his brains out. Turns out the nerds didn't just wander to District Center for nothing. Like, it's convenient to observe remote corners of the Zone from there. So they were tracking with their instruments what's happening all the way at the plant itself. Says they recently detected a massive anomaly there, com-pa-ra-ble by some numbers to... anyway, forgot how he put it, but the gist is: where they burned through this anomaly, there should be a shitload of rare artifacts. They never saw anything like it before, so they figured this was that very klondike all stalkers drool over. They even have an idea that it can like wander from place to place, that's why it's so hard to find. But for now it's there and will stay at that spot for some time. Look here, I'll mark it on your PDA. There. How to get to the station itself, I got no fucking clue. But you probably know the whole deal, right?</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_304"><text>Yeah... should've expected that. All that's left is the small matter - getting to the plant.</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_401"><text>Ah, great, great, bro! How you doing?</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_501"><text>Get the fuck outta here! Not in the mood for you right now.</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_start_dialog_502"><text>Don't lean on the voice. Not impressive.</text></string>
<string id="lim_rashpil_exo_article_title"><text>Vagrant problems</text></string>
<string id="tex_lim_rashpil_exo_article"><text>To haul all the stolen goods for sale, Rasp needs a bandit exoskeleton in excellent condition. For this he promises to give a lead on what's supposedly an artifact klondike located at the plant. He learned about it from some scientist that Rasp's accomplices "mugged".</text></string>

<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_0"><text>Borov, I got an unusual request for you. I saw several of your fighters in exoskeletons. How could I get my hands on one?</text></string>
<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_11"><text>Considering your services to the brotherhood, Marked One, you'll get an exo... if we agree on the price. But I'll say right away: don't expect new, fresh-from-the-box armor. We're not "Bolshevichka" here, everything's made on a knee, same way it's fixed.</text></string>
<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_12"><text>Ha! Now you delivered - wants an exoskeleton, he says! What a performer! Nah, not an option right now. We got a showdown brewing here, and these little suits are needed for our own persuasiveness. Once we sort everything out, then we can discuss it.</text></string>
<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_21"><text>Yeah, that's understandable, no complaints about that. Name your price.</text></string>
<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_22"><text>Yeah, your bruisers do look impressive in them. Then I'll wait for news on this topic.</text></string>
<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_311"><text>The price is as unusual as your request. You'll have to work a bit as supply chief.\nWe're really tight with grub right now. So many mouths grazing on such a small patch, you can see for yourself. It's far from here to the good spots, and Mikhalych can't supply everyone with everything they need right away, though he promises to start bringing more supplies soon. But we wanna eat now. While Veins didn't turn rat, I didn't have to worry about this, but now...\nShort story, we need to stretch until Mikhalych figures out deliveries. Get us 25 rations and the same number of water cans, and we'll be square.</text></string>
<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_312"><text>First, so the brotherhood doesn't bitch about losing such a rare trinket, you'll throw a grand in bucks into the common fund. Second, you'll work a bit as supply chief.\nWe're really tight with grub right now. So many mouths grazing on such a small patch, you can see for yourself. It's far from here to the good spots, and Mikhalych can't supply everyone with everything they need right away, though he promises to start bringing more supplies soon. But we wanna eat now. While Veins didn't turn rat, I didn't have to worry about this, but now...\nShort story, we need to stretch until Mikhalych figures out deliveries. Get us 25 whole, unopened rations and the same number of water cans, and we'll be square.</text></string>
<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_4"><text>Yeah, I thought the price would just be in RU or artifacts at worst, but here... Alright, I'll try to collect that much food and haul it to you.</text></string>
<string id="tex_borov_rashpil_exo_article"><text>Borov agrees to give away one of the exoskeletons belonging to his gang if I help solve their food crisis and bring 25 unopened rations and the same number of energy drink cans to Limansk.</text></string>

<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_0"><text>I wanna talk about the exo again.</text></string>
<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_11"><text>What else is there to chew over? Brought the grub and drinks?</text></string>
<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_12"><text>What else is there to chew over? Brought the grub and drinks? And the money?</text></string>
<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_21"><text>Here's the chow, and here's the drinks. Take it.</text></string>
<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_22"><text>Here's the chow, and here's the drinks. Take it. And this is a check for a grand.</text></string>
<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_23"><text>Not yet. Just decided to check how you're doing here. Who knows... maybe you don't need anything brought anymore.</text></string>
<string id="borov_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_3"><text>Everything's solid, good on you. The boys already started catching rats, but now we'll last until the next food caravan, for sure. One less headache. Listen, Marked One, don't you wanna join us? I'd make you a squad leader right away. Ah whatever, I know you won't go, don't stress. Pack up your exoskeleton, you earned it.</text></string>

<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_0"><text>Bold, I got an unusual request for you. You're like an authority and all that. Can you get me a bandit exoskeleton? Just don't ask what for, deal?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_11"><text>Everyone's got their schemes, I understand. If you need it, you need it. It's a rare thing, you could even say prestigious. You won't get one through dealers or factions. You need connections with the right people here...</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_12"><text>Fuck! Well, you sure asked for something. There ain't even ten of those in the whole Zone. None of the brotherhood ever seen these exos, but... I got a line on one authority, I'll try to push it through. Come back later. Keep in mind, you'll owe me.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_21"><text>Listen, let's skip these preludes. Can you help or not? If you can, name the price. If not, I'm leaving.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_22"><text>Like anyone gives anything in the Zone for free. Got ya, I'll drop by another time.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_31"><text>Sometimes I think they made the wrong guy Bold. Alright, since you're so sharp, let's get to business.\nYou'll get your exoskeleton, and I won't even charge you for it. Don't think I forgot your participation in our little deals, gratitude ain't foreign to us. But I'll still ask for a favor in return.\nLast night a big pack of mutants rushed through the bridge to Limansk. Almost all died blowing up on mines. And fuck 'em, we remined it in the morning. But the snag is we had to use up all our remaining stock on that. Need to restock. Last time we got a whole crate of MONs from the soldiers at Swamp. Through a middleman, of course, it ain't our style to deal direct. I'm offering you to be that middleman. If you got ins with other soldiers, you can get a mine crate from them, but better head to Swamp, they got proven "goods". So, deal?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_32"><text>Sometimes I think they made the wrong guy Bold. Alright, since you're so sharp, let's get to business.\nYou'll get your exoskeleton. It'll cost you a grand, just for delivery. And besides that, I'll ask for a small favor first.\nLast night a big pack of mutants rushed through the bridge to Limansk. Almost all died blowing up on mines. And fuck 'em, we remined it in the morning. But the snag is we had to use up all our remaining stock on that. Need to restock. Last time we got a whole crate of MONs from the soldiers at Swamp. Through a middleman, of course, it ain't our style to deal direct. I'm offering you to be that middleman. If you got ins with other soldiers, you can get a mine crate from them, but better head to Swamp, they got proven "goods". So, deal?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_4"><text>Got myself in deep with this exoskeleton. Everything as usual... What? Ah! Yeah, I'm saying, we got a deal.</text></string>
<string id="tex_borzyi_rashpil_exo_article"><text>Bold is ready to help get a bandit exoskeleton in exchange for a crate of mines, which should be traded from soldiers, either at Swamp or somewhere else.</text></string>

<string id="mil_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_0"><text>Greetings! Need a crate of mines, "MON-50". Shall we make a deal?</text></string>
<string id="mil_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_11"><text>Holy shit! Who you planning to blow up with those? Doesn't matter really, who. We're tight on mines right now. Mutants lately are like they ate henbane. Almost every day they trample mine barriers, and sappers renew them just as regularly. So they're under strict inventory for now. Maybe if things calm down, I can get some. Come back in a week or so.</text></string>
<string id="mil_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_12"><text>Holy shit! Who you planning to blow up with those? Not ours at least? Watch yourself! Anyway, I'll trade a mine crate for two crates of... Heh-heh! Vodka, vodka, what else?! If you agree, come back in an hour, they'll bring it by then.</text></string>
<string id="mil_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_21"><text>Oh, I see... Got it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_22"><text>Agreed. Like I have a choice to buy them at the supermarket around the corner.</text></string>

<string id="mil_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_0"><text>I came for the mines.</text></string>
<string id="mil_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_11"><text>You're early. Don't wear a watch or what?</text></string>
<string id="mil_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_12"><text>There's the crate waiting for you. I'm expecting twice twenty bottles of "official" vodka. How's your math?</text></string>
<string id="mil_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_21"><text>Imagine that, I don't. Recently. Alright, I'll come back later.</text></string>
<string id="mil_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_221"><text>Perfect order. You got a cart? Otherwise I can't figure how you'll haul all this.</text></string>
<string id="mil_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_222"><text>Uh... seems like not so much. Wait a bit, I'll be quick.</text></string>
<string id="mil_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_3"><text>Found the solution! I'll conscript a couple soldiers, they'll haul it where I say. How you think you're gonna lug this crate yourself?</text></string>
<string id="mil_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_4"><text>Damn, it's heavy!</text></string>

<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_0"><text>Greetings, comrade captain! Need a crate of mines, "MON-50". Got any lying around?</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_1"><text>Business-like guy! Serious matters ain't solved like that. How about fifty-fifty? Got something to pour?</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_21"><text>You bet! Always got something for a good man.</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_22"><text>My bad, didn't think... I'll run get some vodka and come back.</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_3"><text>Then let's go. As they say, here's to us and fuck them!</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_4"><text>Strong is Soviet power! Could use some food...</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_5"><text>What "food"? Pour the second one.</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_6"><text>The first shot hasn't even reached me yet... Alright, alright, I'm quiet. To your health, captain!</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_7"><text>That's more like it. Alright, now we can talk business.\nI got mines. We don't really need them, but the supply guys send them every month. What do they care? Required is required. But what do you need them for?</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_8"><text>Well, it's... Need to reliably cover one place from mutants.</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_9"><text>That's awfully wasteful. You'll never have enough mines for mutants. Alright, don't wanna tell the truth, don't. I don't pry into other people's secrets. Then here's my word: for a crate of MONs with proper electric detonators and other sapper gear, I want three grand.</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_10"><text>How much? No other way? Maybe you'll take vodka?</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_11"><text>Ah, you devil, decided to press on a sore spot? Well... vodka works too. It's deadly boring here, you understand? And like this, knock back a shot, everything's not so gloomy. Alright, if you haul two crates of vodka to us, you'll get your mines.</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_start_dlg_12"><text>Two crates? Oh, fuck... Need to figure out which way's cheaper.</text></string>

<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_0"><text>Our deal about the mines still on?</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_1"><text>What, is an officer's word empty sound to you? Bring me forty bottles of vodka or three grand in green, you get a mine crate right there.</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_21"><text>Very good. Brought vodka, unloading it.</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_22"><text>Very good. Brought money. Take it and sign.</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_23"><text>Just wanted to clarify. What if an inspector's coming, or an order came to mine everything to hell, or something else...</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_3"><text>Yeah, everything's straight. Take the crate. Can't imagine how you'll haul it. But that's not my problem anymore.</text></string>
<string id="kalinin_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_4"><text>Damn, it's heavy!</text></string>

<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_0"><text>Came to check about the exoskeleton. Did you manage to get it?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_11"><text>Did you doubt it? Everything's sweet. What about the mines? Made a deal with the soldiers?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_12"><text>Did you doubt it? Everything's sweet. What about the mines? Made a deal with the soldiers? And you didn't forget about the money, I hope?</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_21"><text>If only you knew how much this crate weighs. Barely hauled it. Now... carefully... setting it down. Here's the mines and detonators for them, everything proper.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_22"><text>If only you knew how much this crate weighs. Barely hauled it. Now... carefully... setting it down. Here's the mines and detonators for them, everything proper. And here's your check for a grand.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_23"><text>I wanted to make sure the exo was delivered first. Who knows, you said yourself it's a rare thing. Anyway, I'll be back soon...</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_3"><text>Sweet! This'll last us a long time now. Take your little suit. A bit beaten up, I'll warn you right away. Look, here and here. Don't hold it against me, that's how it was. If anything, take it to the local repair guys, they'll fix everything in no time.</text></string>
<string id="borzyi_rashpil_exo_done_dlg_4"><text>Somehow I was already mentally prepared not to see the latest fashion straight from the best designers...</text></string>

<string id="cherep_start_dialog_51"><text>Ah, you again... Got business or just "see you later"?</text></string>
<string id="cherep_start_dialog_101"><text>Well hello again. I see you're flying back and forth like clockwork...</text></string>
<string id="cherep_start_dialog_102"><text>You too. Don't sit still either. Why here?</text></string>
<string id="cherep_start_dialog_103"><text>DUTY is always where it's needed! And where there's no DUTY, there's no need to be! And I don't advise asking questions and sticking your nose in other people's business. Who knows, you know yourself: say something careless, get something solid back... Don't sulk now. Look at you, huffing. I have orders. You delivered them yourself, remember?</text></string>
<string id="cherep_start_dialog_104"><text>What orders? Ah! You mean the children's rhymes...</text></string>
<string id="cherep_start_dialog_105"><text>Yeah. Those are codes. Who knows - understands.\nYeah! By the way. You're looking for Strelok, as I remember? Or something like that? Am I wrong?</text></string>
<string id="cherep_start_dialog_106"><text>Well... In principle, yes. Only I'm not really hopeful anymore.</text></string>
<string id="cherep_start_dialog_107"><text>That's wrong! Nothing works without hope, I'm telling you for sure. So listen! One of our patrols encountered a strange anomaly. Strange in the sense that there's no harm from it, but no practical use either... Seems like. Anyway, as we understood - in this anomaly you can see another time in this place. We never figured out - whether it's just a "vision" in your head, or a person really "flies" to the past and back...</text></string>
<string id="cherep_start_dialog_108"><text>Yeah? And why do I need this?</text></string>
<string id="cherep_start_dialog_109"><text>Here's why... Anyway, one of those who got into this anomaly says he saw three people carrying a fourth. And one of them addressed another as "Strelok"! Get it?</text></string>
<string id="cherep_start_dialog_110"><text>So what? Big deal, he saw Strelok. Who knows what and to whom appeared.</text></string>
<string id="cherep_start_dialog_111"><text>In principle, you're right, of course. We just talked with him, without details. You have your own interest in Strelok, as I understand. That's why I told you.</text></string>
<string id="cherep_start_dialog_201"><text>Greetings. How are you? Your head? Well alright, none of my business... What did you want?</text></string>
<!-- new -->
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_101"><text>Good day. Is that you? Still dwelling in the Zone? I've had some rest. And I'm back here again.</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_102"><text>Hello. I see you've recovered already. Eh, hard to believe there's another life somewhere.</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_103"><text>I can't believe it myself now. It was like a dream... Now here again - zombies, monsters, grim characters with weapons... And by the way, Marked One, I'm in your debt now, if it wasn't for you, I don't even know.</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_104"><text>Come on, maybe you'll bail me out sometime. There's plenty of characters here. Different ones. Speaking of characters - I met someone at the Warehouses. Seems like one of yours. Sakharov asked me to escort you there. How about it?</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_105"><text>To the Warehouses? That's a whole day's walk. And they say it's a nightmare what's happening on the road! Who else is going?</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_106"><text>Main fighter - you. I'm backup. I see you got yourself a gun?</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_107"><text>Just the two of us? I'm not much of a shooter... Sakharov insisted I drag this shaft with me. But I'm more scared of it than monsters - what if I shoot off something of my own? Anyway, I'd rather stay behind, quietly... Main thing is you get me through Wild Territory, just to Bar, and I'll get there myself and make arrangements with whoever I need. When do we go?</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_1081"><text>Let's go right now. No point dragging it out. I'll get you through the "wild", of course, and at Bar you'll find guides yourself.</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_1082"><text>Wait a bit. Let's move when I prepare my gear.</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_1091"><text>Agreed, I'll follow you. Hope the mutants don't eat us.</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_1092"><text>Alright. I'll be here meanwhile. Come when you're ready.</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_110"><text>Don't worry, let's move.</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_201"><text>Going through Wild Territory? When?</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_301"><text>What? Are we going further or what?</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_302"><text>Don't fall behind.</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_401"><text>Are we there yet?</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_402"><text>Yeah. When you cross into Bar, go left. You'll reach Army Warehouses on the road. There's a Freedom outpost right there, they'll tell you how to get to their base.</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_403"><text>Well, thanks. You go on, Marked One. I'll rest here a bit and move on.</text></string>
<string id="yan_assistant2_start_dialog_501"><text>Don't wait, I'll be fine.</text></string>

<string id="mil_end_assistant2_start_dialog_101"><text>This really is Vasilyev... I can't believe it!</text></string>
<string id="mil_end_assistant2_start_dialog_102"><text>Look closer. It's doubtful somehow. I was told this nutcase appeared here long ago, way before you, Professor Vasilyev and Ghost headed to the lab.</text></string>
<string id="mil_end_assistant2_start_dialog_103"><text>Yeah, it's him for sure! There's the birthmark on his cheek. Definitely.</text></string>
<string id="mil_end_assistant2_start_dialog_104"><text>I don't understand anything then.</text></string>
<string id="mil_end_assistant2_start_dialog_105"><text>Yeah, me neither. I'll try to get him talking, maybe something will clear up. Thanks for bringing me, I'll see what can be done.</text></string>
<string id="mil_end_assistant2_start_dialog_106"><text>Well, go ahead. If anything, maybe I'll drop by again in a few days. You can tell me how it goes.</text></string>
<string id="mil_end_assistant2_start_dialog_107"><text>Alright. Deal. Yeah, by the way, Sakharov wanted to give you something. To thank you for something. When you're at Yantar - drop by to see him.</text></string>
<string id="mil_end_assistant2_start_dialog_108"><text>Uh-huh.</text></string>
<string id="mil_end_assistant2_start_dialog_201"><text>Hi. I'm dealing with Vasilyev for now, no time to talk.</text></string>
<string id="mil_end_assistant2_start_dialog_301"><text>What? Are we going further or what?</text></string>

<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_101"><text>Oh! Hi! Long time no see. How are you? Heading to the Center for the ultimate artifact?</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_102"><text>Hi to you too. I'm still looking for a way to get my memory back. So I have to travel all over the Zone. What are you doing here? Not at the center yet?</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_103"><text>Had that idea. But... Decided to see how it is in general. Lots of people rushed there, but nobody came back. Makes you suspicious. If nobody shows up in another week, we'll try a different solution.</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_1041"><text>Well then. Alright. Sit tight. I'll go about my business.</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_1042"><text>Haven't you heard yet? Seems like some kind of plague is coming from Pripyat!</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_105"><text>Plague? Mutants or what? Nobody said anything. How do you know?</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_106"><text>The people who rushed to Pripyat right after the shutdown seem to be sitting around, can't even move them with a stick. Nobody's coming back.</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_107"><text>Well... Who knows! People are tired, resting. Not everyone's got a broom up their ass like you. So...</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_108"><text>I talked to... a scientist. He said the "Brain Scorcher" wasn't working for nothing. It was stopping some kind of radiation that affects people so they don't want anything at all. They fall into apathy. And this radiation keeps getting stronger. If the "Scorcher" isn't turned on again - it'll cover the whole Zone. Then we'll all just sit and smile. And watch monsters eat us...</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_109"><text>No wonder I see, don't even have strength to stand. Yeah. And we were happy that Ivar shut down this brain boiler. Now we gotta turn it back on? Will it work? What about the people?</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_110"><text>Got a couple ideas. I'll check them out.</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_111"><text>A couple ideas is good. But concrete actions would be better.</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_201"><text>Hi. How's it going? Good?</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_2021"><text>Yeah, seems like it. How are you guys?</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_2031"><text>How? Like this. Not warm, not cold. Just something inside. Ah well, it'll pass!</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_2022"><text>Haven't you heard yet? Seems like some kind of plague is coming from Pripyat!</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_203"><text>Seems normal... But somehow heavy. And no people with full loot from the center. Though... Whatever... Eh-h-h-h...</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_301"><text>Ugh. What? Something's not right with me...</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_3021"><text>Yeah, it's understandable. Plague - it hits everyone. I feel sick and nauseous inside too. But gotta get things done...</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_3031"><text>Yeah, you're like a live wire.</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_3022"><text>Yeah. I got info that there's an underground here somewhere where you can power up the brain burner. You know about anything like that?</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_3032"><text>Underground... A lab, maybe? There's some kind down the corridor to the north. We wanted to scout what's there and how, but there was no power at the coded entrance, and blowing it up is dangerous - everything'll collapse to hell.</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_304"><text>What if there was power? You know the code?</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_305"><text>Code? Why? There's a code breaker. I traded for it from a specialist. Only it won't turn on anymore. Either the battery died or some wire came loose.</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_306"><text>Hmm. Mind lending it for a while? I'll run to Bar, maybe we can fix it.</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_307"><text>You... Alright. Just tell me if anything works out with the "Scorcher". Don't wanna turn into a zombie...</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_308"><text>Yeah, I'll tell you.</text></string>
<string id="rad_seryi_start_dialog_401"><text>Uh... It's you... Should lie down. And you're like a meteor.</text></string>

<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_101"><text>Hey there, Marked One. What brings you here? Like everyone else - looking for the artifact klondike?</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_102"><text>Stay healthy yourself. I have to look for myself. So the thread led me here. What about you? Found the "klondike"?</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_103"><text>Yeah, we wanted to at first. But... Some doubt arose. Nobody came back after all. Suspicious. Decided not to rush things for now. We'll wait.</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_1041"><text>Got it. Well, take care. I'll go.</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_1042"><text>Looks like it hit you guys too? Covered by apathy...</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_105"><text>What? What are you talking about?</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_106"><text>The people who rushed to Pripyat right after the shutdown seem to be sitting around, can't even move them with a stick. Nobody's coming back.</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_107"><text>Well... Who knows! People are tired, resting. Not everyone's got a broom up their ass like you. So...</text></string>

<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_110"><text>Got a couple ideas. I'll check them out.</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_111"><text>You better warn people if something happens.</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_201"><text>Oh. Hi. What? Still running around, running around...</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_2021"><text>Need to, so... How are you guys?</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_2031"><text>Need to... But I don't need anything. Peace. That's nice.</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_2022"><text>What?! The people who rushed to Pripyat right after the shutdown seem to be sitting around, can't even move them with a stick. Nobody's coming back.</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_203"><text>Yeah, we're doing... okay. Slowly. Got food. Waiting for stalkers to come with loot.</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_301"><text>Uh... You. You were just here? Or was that yesterday? Something's wrong with my head, it's like cast iron.</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_3021"><text>No wonder. You should get to Bar or something. Though it'll probably hit there soon too. I'm starting to run out of steam too...</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_3031"><text>You're like lightning. Back and forth, back and forth... Makes my head spin.</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_3022"><text>Yeah. I got info that there's an underground here somewhere where you can power up the brain burner. You know about anything like that?</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_3032"><text>Underground... A lab, maybe? There's some kind down the corridor to the north. We wanted to scout what's there and how, but there was no power at the coded entrance, and blowing it up is dangerous - everything'll collapse to hell.</text></string>

<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_308"><text>Yeah, I'll tell you.</text></string>
<string id="rad_bes_start_dialog_401"><text>Fuck. Heavy. Should leave, but legs won't move...</text></string>

<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_101"><text>Hi. Just passing by or dropping in on us? Heading to the center for the ultimate artifact? We met before. Marked One, right?</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_102"><text>Hi to you too. Yeah, that's me. Looking for a way to get my memory back. So I have to travel all over the Zone. What are you doing here? Not at the center yet?</text></string>

<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_108"><text>I talked to... a scientist. He said the "Brain Scorcher" wasn't working for nothing. It was stopping some kind of radiation that affects people so they don't want anything at all. They fall into apathy. And this radiation keeps getting stronger. If the "Scorcher" isn't turned on again - it'll cover the whole Zone. Then we'll all just sit and smile. And watch monsters eat us...</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_109"><text>No wonder I see, don't even have strength to stand. Yeah. And we were happy that Ivar shut down this brain boiler. Now we gotta turn it back on? Will it work? What about the people?</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_110"><text>Got a couple ideas. I'll check them out.</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_111"><text>A couple ideas is good. But a concrete plan would be better.</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_201"><text>Hi. How's it going? Good?</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_2021"><text>Yeah, seems like it. How are you guys?</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_2031"><text>Us? How to put it. Seems fine, but also... Hard to tell.</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_2022"><text>Not all good! The people who rushed to Pripyat right after the shutdown seem to be sitting around, can't even move them with a stick. Nobody's coming back.</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_203"><text>Seems normal... But somehow heavy. And no people with full loot from the center. Though... Whatever... Eh-h-h-h...</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_301"><text>Ugh. What? Something's not right with me...</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_3021"><text>Yeah, it's understandable. Plague - it hits everyone. I feel sick and nauseous inside too. But gotta get things done...</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_3031"><text>Yeah, you're like a live wire.</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_3022"><text>Yeah. I got info that there's an underground here somewhere where you can power up the brain burner. You know about anything like that?</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_3032"><text>Underground... A lab, maybe? There's some kind down the corridor to the north. We wanted to scout what's there and how, but there was no power at the coded entrance, and blowing it up is dangerous - everything'll collapse to hell.</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_304"><text>What if there was power? You know the code?</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_305"><text>Code? Why? There's a code breaker. I traded for it from a specialist. Only it won't turn on anymore. Either the battery died or some wire came loose.</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_306"><text>Hmm. Mind lending it for a while? I'll run to Bar, maybe we can fix it.</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_307"><text>You... I could lend it. But I paid good money for it... So... I won't give it for free. You're an experienced guy, so I'll trade it for a "Dummy" artifact. Not damaged. So no flies buzzing. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_3081"><text>Hmm. Not damaged? Alright. Here.</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_3082"><text>Don't have one on me...</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_309"><text>Good. That's fine. Here, take it. Just tell me if anything works out with the "Scorcher". Don't wanna turn into a zombie...</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_310"><text>Alright. I'll tell you.</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_401"><text>Uh... It's you... Should lie down. With a river, and quiet...</text></string>
<string id="rad_sub_glavn_start_dialog_4021"><text>You'll have plenty of time to lie around. I brought an undamaged "Dummy".</text></string>

<string id="docent_decoder_dialog_0"><text>I got this decoder that's not working, take a look?</text></string>
<string id="docent_decoder_dialog_1"><text>Hmm... Right. Well, I'll take a look. You'll owe me, you understand...</text></string>
<string id="docent_decoder_dialog_2"><text>I understand. And what exactly will I owe?</text></string>
<string id="docent_decoder_dialog_3"><text>I'll see. If it's not too complicated, then one thing, but if something's really wrong - different story. Anyway, come back tomorrow. I think everything will be clear by then.</text></string>
<string id="docent_decoder_dialog_4"><text>Well... Alright.</text></string>

<string id="docent_decoder_end_dialog_0"><text>So, did you manage with the decoder?</text></string>
<string id="docent_decoder_end_dialog_1"><text>Yeah, turned out to be a trifle really. It'll cost you a couple second-level artifacts. Deal?</text></string>
<string id="docent_decoder_end_dialog_21"><text>Hmm, alright. Here you go. You say it's a trifle, but you want good artifacts?</text></string>
<string id="docent_decoder_end_dialog_22"><text>Don't have any on me. I'll check my stash.</text></string>
<string id="docent_decoder_end_dialog_3"><text>A trifle is a trifle, but I killed time looking for the problem. Plus - life is hard... You know yourself. \nHere, take the device.</text></string>
<string id="docent_decoder_end_dialog_4"><text>You shouldn't kill time, but manage it. Well alright. Thanks.</text></string>

<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_0"><text>I got some documents here, will you take a look?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_1"><text>Where do you keep getting these from? What's all this stuff smeared with?! Such nastiness... You should've dried them or something. Alright, when I'm free - I'll look. I'm busy right now.\nYou'll owe me. Just got my hands dirty, damn...</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_21"><text>Big deal, he got dirty! Sometimes you crawl knee-deep in s... filth all day... Be thankful nobody used these papers for hygiene procedures. As for "owing", we'll figure something out.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_22"><text>Big deal, he got dirty! Sometimes you crawl knee-deep in s... filth all day... Be thankful nobody used these papers for hygiene procedures. As for "owing", didn't you mix something up, eh, Docent? Or did you already forget how I collected money for your brother?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_31"><text>Why are you getting worked up? I said I'll look, but later. Come back tomorrow or in a couple days.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_32"><text>Yeah, sorry, I... Anyway, I'll look at everything, but later, okay? Come back tomorrow or in a couple days.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_4"><text>No-no! None of this "tomorrow". I know you - you'll flip through for five minutes, then act like you slaved away all day without rest. Look right here. At least just to know: is this junk or something useful.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_5"><text>So persistent... Alright. Wait here. Hmm... strange, recently some guy tried to sell me very similar papers. But I only glanced through them diagonally and sent the hustler packing - there was nothing of interest to me there. So...</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_6"><text>Really strange. Where could he have found similar documents?! Well, doesn't matter. So, what's in there?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_71"><text>Be quiet for a bit, you're interfering... Anyway, here's the topic. There are some drainage systems for flooded underground areas. As I understand, these are powerful pumps that are quite probably still in working condition. They're activated in some underground communications hub. There's also office correspondence regarding a duty post at the laboratory... Can't make out the index, everything's smeared here. Does this tell you anything? Anyway, I'd need to study this more thoughtfully... So for more specific information - a third-level artifact from you. No, probably even two artifacts. And they must be in good condition, those pay more. You understand, there are few people at Bar now, income has really dropped.</text></string>

<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_81"><text>Pumps that turn on who knows where and, most importantly, why... Some duty post... Seems to me this is all unnecessary, useless information. At least for now. Hold off with the artifacts for now, businessman. Maybe another time.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_82"><text>I need it. Pumps that turn on who knows where and, most importantly, why... We'll talk about that another time maybe. But tell me more about the post. How do I get there?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_83"><text>I need it. I'm not interested in the post, that's unnecessary now. But I'd like to learn more about the tunnels and pumps.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_921"><text>You know what, Marked One? I got a bit ahead of myself saying I was ready to bother with finding the info you need. Right now I don't have time. Got plenty of my own headaches, and here others try to pile on more. No offense, but let's return to this conversation later, okay?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_922"><text>Wait. So, this isn't it... Ah, here's the beginning. So listen: the room you need, according to the plan, is on the lower level of the laboratory. From the room with the freight elevator, go down the service stairs all the way, you'll get to a small hall from which a long corridor begins. On the right you'll see a door with a code lock - that's where you need to go. Interestingly, here in the correspondence they even give the code, if it's still valid of course. Write it down: 513390. Anything else you're interested in?</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_93"><text>You know what, Marked One? I got a bit ahead of myself saying I was ready to bother with finding the info you need. Right now I don't have time.

And please, prepare payment for my services in advance - a third-level artifact. No, probably even two artifacts. And they must be in good condition, those pay more. You understand, there are few people at Bar these days, income has really dropped, and I desperately need money right now.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_1021"><text>Well... fine. It's not exactly urgent for me. I'll come back later.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_1022"><text>No, I found out the main thing. Well done! Consider you've already worked off part of the debt. Alright, I'm moving on with my business. Take care.</text></string>
<string id="docent_x12docs_dialog_103"><text>Well, that's quite a price tag. I understand everything, of course, but charging like that... Though, what am I gonna do, pickle them?! Alright, I'll come back later with artifacts.</text></string>

<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_0"><text>Listen, Docent, got a million-dollar deal...</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_1"><text>Yeah? I've got one too actually. Not a million, of course, less, but still a significant sum.</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_2"><text>Uh... Well, you go first then.</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_3"><text>I got a serious problem on my hands. Well, not me personally, but my younger brother, Genka. He's not here, not in the Zone, of course. Lives in the States, been there a couple years now. Anyway, he sent me a message by email the other day. Duty has satellite internet, if you didn't know. They charge a lot, but you can use it once a month. So my brother writes that he got himself into trouble... amateur hacker. I knew he was into cracking, but I thought it was just fooling around, youth stuff. So he hacked some corporate network, but left traces and got caught by the cops. They're already building a case and it looks like they might lock up Genka for ten years, maybe more.</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_4"><text>I sympathize, of course, but how can I help?</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_5"><text>With money. You see, a good lawyer there charges a hell of a lot for services, but it's usually worth it. Plus need to post bail so they'll release him on recognizance. I've shaken down all my stashes, Genka had some saved up too, but we're still short ten grand. Will you help, Marked One? I'll pay it all back in time or work it off. You often need something found, some code picked, or whatever. Don't know who else to turn to, everyone rushed to the center... Might as well go look for artifacts myself.</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_61"><text>Wow! That's really big money. You're lucky, I have the needed sum. And even on me, in bearer checks. So be it, I'll help your idiot brother, but you now owe me big time, remember that.</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_62"><text>Yeah, really got myself into it... I'm not exactly poor myself, but I can't pull together such a sum right away, but... Fuck it, money isn't happiness - there's a reason they say that, right? I'll try to collect ten grand. Won't hide it, I'll need something from you too, and pretty soon at that.</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_71"><text>Thanks a million, Marked One! You saved me! Honestly, I'll do anything for you now, just say the word!</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_72"><text>Thanks, Marked One! You'd really oblige me, I'll do anything for you if you can help.</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_81"><text>You can do something right now. I need information about a certain duty post at laboratory X-12. Was such a room mentioned in the papers I brought you? Maybe something came up in a PDA or other sources?</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_82"><text>Yeah, you won't get away with just "thanks", be sure of that. Alright, I'll try to handle all the business as soon as possible. Wait.</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_911"><text>Sounds familiar... Wait a bit, I'll run a search on the laptop - I keep a summary list of useful gathered info there...\nMm... Right, got it! Now, let me find the right papers...\nAh, here it is. From the room with the freight elevator, go down the service stairs all the way, you'll get to a small hall from which a long corridor begins. On the right you'll see a door with a code lock - that's where you need to go. Interestingly, here in the office correspondence they even give the code, if it's still valid of course. Write it down: 513390.</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_912"><text>Don't recall... Wait a bit, I'll run a search on the laptop - I keep a summary list of useful gathered info there...\nMm... no, nothing. Sorry, Marked One, search came up empty. I understand you've already been to X-12 and couldn't find this duty post, or simply don't know what to look for, right? Nodding? Then I'd advise you to go down to that lab again and check if there are any interesting papers lying around. You're good at that. Maybe you'll find some lead. Or stumble upon the right place by accident.</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_921"><text>Excellent! Consider you've already worked off part of the debt. Alright, I'm moving on with my business. Take care.</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_ask_dialog_922"><text>Yeah... my investment isn't paying off yet, Docent. Well, seems like I have no choice - I'll have to drag myself to that creepy place again.</text></string>
<string id="tex_docent_secret_room_ask_article"><text>Docent is trying to collect money to get his brother out of trouble, who faces prison on the mainland. He's short 10 thousand dollars. If I help find this sum, Docent will be obligated to me "till death" and I can easily use his talents for any of my affairs. And I'll probably still need his talents. At least to figure out the duty post at laboratory X-12, where I need to get based on Sakharov's tip.</text></string>

<string id="docent_secret_room_done_dialog_0"><text>Got good news for your brother, genius.</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_done_dialog_1"><text>Really? You collected the necessary sum and you're ready to just give it to me like that? I... I don't even know what... how...</text></string>
<string id="docent_secret_room_done_dialog_2"><text>Hard to believe that not everyone around is a mercenary bastard, right? Here are the checks, they're bearer bonds, a grand denomination each, exactly ten pieces. And remember - you now owe me big time.</text></string>

<!-- mike -->
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_101"><text>Oh! It's you, Marked One! What brings you here?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_102"><text>Hey! Vergas, great to see you! And I have a question for you: what are you doing here?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_103"><text>What do you mean?! Heard they shut down the "Brain Scorcher"? Now you can walk all the way to the station!</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_104"><text>To the station? Yeah, right. You better tell me, haven't you seen a stalker here - they call him Ghost? I was told he should be waiting for me somewhere around here.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_105"><text>I got here with him. He said that now, with the "Scorcher" turned off, we can try to get all the way to the Monolith. And this Monolith, it's a thing that can do everything! Or almost everything. You just need to wish really hard. So I convinced Ghost to take me along - I want to make a wish too.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_106"><text>You too? Alright, and where's this elusive Ghost now?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_107"><text>He got some important message, grabbed his legs and ran off. Told me to wait here for a few days. This was at night. At first I thought maybe he had a bad dream.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_108"><text>Well I'll be damned! Do you know why he came to Radar at all? And how did you end up with him, I don't get it? I'll never believe Ghost just showed up at Cordon to personally escort you to the Monolith.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_109"><text>He came to Cordon because he had business with me. Ghost wanted me to repair something for him - a decoder. He was in a real hurry. Probably that's why he decided to take me along, so I could work on it during the trip. I did what I could.\nAnyway, he was trying to get into a bunker that's nearby. Ghost went there, to the door into the underground. Turned out the code lock had no power. He brought the device back to me for refinishing, the contacts were poorly soldered, which made it cut out sometimes. I already fixed that. Only Ghost didn't wait for me to finish the job - he split at night. Well, I already told you about that.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_110"><text>Something tells me Ghost never planned to drag you to the station and only needed you for one purpose.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_111"><text>Well, what's done is done... Since I came, can't leave without him.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_112"><text>You say it had no power there... Give me that device, I'll go take a look. If you don't mind.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_113"><text>I don't mind. Here it is. Only Ghost already went there. Useless. He wasted good artifacts for it...\nIt's simple to use. Need to connect it, turn it on. Then try four-digit combinations. There are two columns of lights. If lights come on in the left column, that means that many digits are in the combination, but not in the right place. If lights come on in both left and right, that means that many digits are in the combination and they're in the right place. But to figure out which digits and in what place, you need to deduce logically... Though after eight tries it auto-resets... But as soon as all the lights come on, you need to turn it off and without removing the device, enter that combination. Got it? Without disconnecting the device, enter the combination. And only then disconnect it.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_114"><text>Sounds complicated...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_115"><text>What can you do. Consider it repaired right on my knee. Had to simplify some things. But it works, and that's the main thing.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_116"><text>Alright, I'll try. I'll take a walk over there. Maybe I'll get lucky...</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_201"><text>Hello again! How's it going?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_202"><text>Slowly. And you're still here?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_203"><text>Waiting for Ghost. I think he'll be back in a few days. Or not.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_301"><text>Hello again! How's it going?</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_302"><text>Still waiting for Ghost? He's sitting at Yantar and doesn't even think about you. So you should head back to Cordon with someone.</text></string>
<string id="vergas_start_dialog_303"><text>You're probably right, I should head home.</text></string>

<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_0"><text>Listen, you really just walked here like that - in a sweater?</text></string>
<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_1"><text>What's the big deal? You can't go anywhere without a special suit. You can see for yourself...</text></string>
<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_2"><text>Well, what about here, now? Everyone I've seen doesn't get out of protective armor, suits and such.</text></string>
<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_3"><text>I got old, sweating in a suit, and relieving yourself in it - what a pain in the ass. Put it in a box for now. Good suit, new, scientific, but don't need it now, when I do - I'll put it on. And you can breathe here without a mask it seems.</text></string>
<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_4"><text>Hmm... Maybe you're right. Where'd you get the suit? Ghost hook you up?</text></string>
<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_5"><text>Nah. I bought it from Sakharov. We stopped by Yantar on the way. There was some sick guy lying there. Ghost knew him. So we visited. Then came here. Why are you asking about the suit?</text></string>
<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_51"><text>Nah. I bought it from Sakharov. We stopped by Yantar on the way. Why are you asking about the suit?</text></string>
<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_6"><text>Just thought - how are you with repairs? Would you work? And maybe I can get some supplies from you, medicine, say? I'd pay...</text></string>
<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_7"><text>My hands know their business, but I don't have tools or materials. So sorry... I have medicine. I knew where I was going, brought extra with me, my health, you understand - need to look ahead and take more medicine. I'll think about whether it's worth sharing...</text></string>
<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_8"><text>I see. Your health is more valuable than others', that's understandable. \nBut I'm actually surprised why you left home at your age? Others are one thing, but you're not young to go running after the boys at the first call... You could've sat by the stove at Cordon and known no troubles. And here with that same suit it's nothing but hassle - put it on, take it off, put it on again. At your ag... a-hem. Well, you get it.</text></string>
<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_9"><text>I sit and think myself... why did I suddenly do this. Then I learned I wasn't the only one, many rushed north. Turns out they turned off the "Scorcher".</text></string>
<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_10"><text>Well they turned it off and turned it off, what's it to you? Is Ghost your brother or relative that you'd run after him?</text></string>
<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_11"><text>I don't know... I don't understand myself. Really, after some emission it was like a call in my head, like someone called... And for a moment it seemed to me it was so good there, that I had to see it. And then I heard that call in my head more than once. Probably senile, ringing in my ears from pressure, so I imagine things. And now where do I go? Can't go there, and can't crawl back alone. I'll wait for Ghost.</text></string>
<string id="dead_vergas_kostum_12"><text>Alright, I get it. Well, take care... Tell Ghost I stopped by if he comes back.</text></string>

<string id="gen_hermit_vodka_dialog_41"><text>Got a bottle here, trading for cans.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_vodka_dialog_42"><text>Three bottles, I'll take an artifact.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_vodka_dialog_43"><text>Got seven bottles, give me an artifact.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_vodka_dialog_44"><text>Here's vodka, 15 pieces, give me the capsule.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_vodka_dialog_5"><text>Hmm, got some, but need it myself, maybe later.</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_vodka_dialog_61"><text>Ah! There she is, my darling... For the cans, not expired it seems... Need more - just ask...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_vodka_dialog_62"><text>Yeah-yeah, I got a simple little artifact. "Sparkler" here...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_vodka_dialog_63"><text>Oh! Little bottles... And here's a good artifact, "Flash"... Wanted to keep it for myself - ah well...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_vodka_dialog_64"><text>Wow! That'll last a long time now. Here's the capsule, good thing you're taking it, it radiates like hell...</text></string>
<string id="gen_hermit_vodka_dialog_7"><text>I'll stock up on more bottles, then come back.</text></string>

<string id="sidor_mayat_capsule_dialog_0"><text>I got this strange thing, looks like a capsule, take a look.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_mayat_capsule_dialog_1"><text>Let me see, let me see... What the hell are you thinking?! Finally decided to finish off Sidorovich. Dragging all kinds of crap here. This thing reeks of radiation from a mile away. Get lost with your junk.</text></string>
<string id="sidor_mayat_capsule_dialog_2"><text>I'm gone, I'm gone... got all worked up.</text></string>

<string id="barman_mayat_capsule_dialog_0"><text>I got this strange thing, looks like a capsule, take a look.</text></string>
<string id="barman_mayat_capsule_dialog_1"><text>Let me see, let me see... Marked One, this might be a capsule. But I'm seeing this thing for the first time and won't stick it in my machine. What could come out of it?</text></string>
<string id="barman_mayat_capsule_dialog_2"><text>What a mess, and where do I go with it now...</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_dialog_0"><text>Professor, I managed to get an unusual capsule.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_dialog_11"><text>Show me... Well yes, well yes. Second-class shell. You see, Marked One, opening such a capsule in field conditions is currently not possible - the energy costs of this process are too high. This carries significant risks for our camp's safety. You understand we work in complete autonomy and have no additional energy sources besides basic diesel generators.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_dialog_12"><text>Show me... Well yes, well yes. Second-class shell. You see, Marked One, opening such a capsule in field conditions is quite energy-intensive. Fortunately, just yesterday we received a new generator, which though formally listed as backup, can quite well be used... slightly not as intended.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_dialog_21"><text>So there's really nothing that can be done?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_dialog_22"><text>Tell me straight: will you undertake to open this capsule?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_dialog_31"><text>I think you'd hardly be satisfied with sending this sample to our institute outside the Zone, would you? On the other hand, we're expecting soon approval of a request to deliver a backup generator here, which could be used, among other things, for some... specific needs.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_dialog_32"><text>If you entrust us with such a rare specimen, then absolutely.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_dialog_41"><text>In short, all that's left is to wait. Got it. I'll come back later then.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_have_dialog_0"><text>Professor, I want to open this capsule. Second-class shell - I think that's what you called it.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_have_dialog_1"><text>Yes-yes! Happy to help you. Moreover, honestly speaking, I'm interested myself... out of pure scientific curiosity, of course. Not every day we get to deal with such rare specimens. Only you know, Marked One, we have strict accounting for everything, including energy consumption. Have to dance around auditors, explaining above-normal consumption, and some people require... a special approach. Well, you understand. And delivering fuel for generators here is quite expensive. So please help us too. I think a third-level artifact in good condition is fair payment for our costs.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_have_dialog_11"><text>You know, my dear fellow, the installation is busy for now, let's try a bit later.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_have_dialog_22"><text>Well... as you say. Will this one do?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_have_dialog_23"><text>Yeah, professor, unfortunately I don't have such a thing.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_have_dialog_31"><text>Of course! Please, come back tomorrow, same time. I think everything will be ready by then.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_have_dialog_33"><text>Very unfortunate... We can't afford charity for now.</text></string>

<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_already_dialog_0"><text>Well, how did it go? What came out of that capsule?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_already_dialog_11"><text>Need to wait a bit more, the coating is quite resistant. Come back later.</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_already_dialog_12"><text>Managed to open it, here's your artifact. These formations are called "Pendulums". Very, very rare specimen. Perhaps you'll donate it to science?</text></string>
<string id="sakharov_mayat_capsule_already_dialog_2"><text>Alright, I'll check back...</text></string>

<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_0"><text>Stepanych, I wanted to ask you something...</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_1"><text>Ask away, don't be shy. And sit down, hunchback drink.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_2"><text>You've been walking the forests for a long time, I see you have a modern gun. Doesn't such an old hunter have a good proven rifle? One with good accuracy.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_3"><text>The boys gave me this shooter, and threw in a whole crate of shot for it. There's such a rifle, but who to hunt with it? And cartridges for it became expensive. So it hangs on the wall at home.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_4"><text>What kind of rifle?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_5"><text>Good rifle. Still my father's, "Mosinka", with optics.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_6"><text>Yeah, good barrel... So maybe you'll give it up, why should it gather house dust for nothing. A good barrel should serve, not hang on the wall. How about it?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_7"><text>That's true, you speak right. Only this... I can't decide right away what to take from you for it.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_8"><text>Maybe bring some artifact or do what's needed. You tell me, old man.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_9"><text>Here's such an adventure. One old customer of mine asked me to make him a good cloak. I quickly got the hides for it, but on the way back a pack of blind dogs attacked me. They're such a pain. So I climbed on a rock. Threw off my backpack, and it landed in "Witch's Jelly". The hides got ruined. Now I'm embarrassed before that man. So bring me three finished hides, two will go for the cloak, and I'll keep one as spare. Then we'll discuss this matter.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_10"><text>Three hides?! Alright, Stepanych, you'll have your hides.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_11"><text>Hides, son, that's just for the rifle.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_12"><text>What do I need this stick without a sight for?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_13"><text>That's true. Only the sight is quite rare, can't get it anymore, they don't make them anymore.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_14"><text>I see, old man. What kind of sight do you want?</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_15"><text>I, an old man, don't need much. A good artifact, and you'll have the sight. I'll even throw in some cartridges, since I'm giving away the rifle, I don't need them anymore.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_16"><text>Deal, I'll bring both hides and an artifact. Just don't forget about the rifle.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_17"><text>I won't forget about that. You go get the hides and artifact, and I'll go home, maybe I'll be back tomorrow.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_18"><text>I'll try not to take long. Take care, Stepanych.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_start_19"><text>No, old man, you're asking too much, keep the rifle yourself.</text></string>

<string id="stepanych_mosin_done_0"><text>Stepanych, remind me what I promised you for the "Mosinka" with sight.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_done_1"><text>Three finished hides, and a good artifact.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_done_21"><text>I brought both hides and artifact, everything as agreed. Show me the rifle.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_done_3"><text>Well you young ones are always rushing and rushing. Take it, son, the "Mosinka" and sight, and for respecting an old man, here's some cartridges too. I don't need them now.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_done_4"><text>And for that - special thanks. Stay healthy, Stepanych.</text></string>
<string id="stepanych_mosin_done_22"><text>Wait, Stepanych.</text></string>
<string id="tex_stepanych_mosin"><text>Stepanych promised a Mosin rifle with scope for three finished hides and a third-level artifact</text></string>

<string id="part_exchanger_monster_dialog_3"><text>Well... If we're talking money, then how much?</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_monster_dialog_4"><text>Let's say... If you figure it out, in general... Alright! Just for you and just today! Attraction of unprecedented generosity: a grand! Can you handle it?</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_monster_dialog_5"><text>A thousand green for a piece of stinking meat?! You didn't mix anything up?!</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_monster_dialog_6"><text>No, dear. A check for a grand from you. No haggling. No? Then go shoot some monsters, I'll trade with great pleasure. So, what is it?</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_monster_dialog_7"><text>You... hold onto it for now, maybe I'll come back soon with the needed sum.</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_monster_dialog_8"><text>I'll hold it. But not long! I got a couple enthusiasts for this business, just don't feel like walking anywhere right now...</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_monster_dialog_61"><text>Alright, here's the check.</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_monster_dialog_91"><text>Yeah, I undersold, however. But a man said - a man did! Take this, not the freshest of course, but still quite in condition.</text></string>
<string id="part_exchanger_monster_dialog_10"><text>Rotten piece for a grand in green! Virtue, your...</text></string>

<string id="tex_ivancov_x10harddisc"><text>Ivantsov asks to bring at least eleven hard drives from computers from the laboratory under Borov's base in Dark Valley</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_dialog_0"><text>Why were you looking for me? Or just missed me?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_dialog_1"><text>A little birdie told me you're planning to go to the old laboratory that's at Borov's former base, looking for traces of your Strelok. Right?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_dialog_2"><text>People these days... Barely discussed it and the whole area already knows.\nSuppose I am, what's it to you?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_dialog_3"><text>We're interested in information from the computers that should have been left there.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_dialog_4"><text>Bring you computers? And who is this "we"?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_dialog_5"><text>Who - you don't need to know. Don't need to drag the computers themselves, extract the hard drives from them, that's where all the information is stored. And they don't weigh much - maximum half a kilo. Uh... You know what a hard drive is? It's a thing like this:</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_dialog_6"><text>I think I've seen them before. Anything else?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_dialog_7"><text>Good. I know there are many computers there and the information on them is partially duplicated. Smart people here figured that eleven drives of any kind would be enough to collect the entire data array. Remember? Eleven - no less. Or should I write it down for you?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_dialog_8"><text>Very funny... And your jokes are cop-like. You wouldn't happen to be one of the "former", would you?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_dialog_9"><text>Cop or not cop, what's the difference to you, let's get to business. I'll tell our guys in the Valley not to interfere with you. This is for the road and... try to come back.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_dialog_10"><text>I see everyone's become caring. I know your care. You're all clean, and you, Marked One, run to the ass-end of the world, find, bring or kill finally... And we'll wait here. You come back - good, don't - well, fuck you. So I'll tell you the same - if it works out, I'll bring it, if not, then not.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_dialog_11"><text>Getting worked up... Tone down your arrogance. Or you might not leave this basement. That's all, you're free.</text></string>

<string id="ivancov_x10_2dialog_0"><text>I brought the drives from the underground. As agreed, count them.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_2dialog_1"><text>What a sight you are, Marked One... Yeah, looks like they're in the right quantity. Well done.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_2dialog_2"><text>Maybe you'll give me a medal too? Take them and I'm gone.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_x10_2dialog_3"><text>A medal... I'll think about it. I'll give the drives to Docent, let him dig around. I'll signal if anything interesting comes up.</text></string>

<string id="tex_ivancov_mil_zubr"><text>Ivantsov asks to find one Pavel Zubr at Army Warehouses. Need to try to learn about an old door in the tunnel at Freedom's base</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_dialog_0"><text>You're fast. Found something in those computer memories?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_dialog_1"><text>Found it, found a lot. Can't digest it all at once. There'll be another job for you...\nI need you to go to these freethinkers' base and find this Pavel Zubr guy. He's their entertainer - invented "Duty roulette" for the reckless and gullible.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_dialog_21"><text>There is such a guy, had to deal with him. And what - ask him, find out or..?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_dialog_22"><text>And what - ask him, find out or..?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_dialog_23"><text>Find others, I've had enough of laboratories.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_dialog_3"><text>No "or" anything... I'm interested in the coded door in the collapsed tunnel. There's information that the Freedom brotherhood is really worried about what's behind those doors. And this joker is responsible for guarding it. So you go to him and try - quietly there! - to find out: what kind of door, where it leads and... in general. The more you learn, the sooner we'll get answers to some questions that will also interest you, I think.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_dialog_4"><text>Again "we"?! And why did you decide this would interest me. Maybe I already don't give a damn about everyone and everything. Did such a thought ever occur to you? Maybe I've long been on my own, Marked One - the Marked. And what difference does it make - whether they kill me here or there.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_dialog_5"><text>But I heard the complete opposite here, that you decided to save humanity. So maybe this is exactly the place you need to go?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_dialog_6"><text>Just don't tell me you suddenly decided to help me for this reason.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_dialog_7"><text>Fine, let's approach this from another angle. On those drives you brought from the underground in the Valley, there's information about other underground laboratories, their interconnections, emergency exits to the surface and so on. It turns out there's a possibility to enter them from the surface, bypassing the currently active sections of the Zone. And you won't have to wander through Radar again.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_dialog_8"><text>Why do I need this? There is and there is. Why are you all clinging to me? First Sidorovich, then Barkeep, Sakharov, now you.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_dialog_9"><text>And you still haven't figured it out yourself? I, honestly, haven't fully figured you out either. But I know one thing for sure, that you're exactly the one the Zone will let into its very core.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_dialog_10"><text>We're having a long conversation. I better go to the warehouses.</text></string>

<string id="mil_minigame_door_dialog_0"><text>Listen, Pavlo! What's that armored door in the tunnel?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_dialog_1"><text>What's it to you? Door is door... Less you know - better you sleep.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_dialog_2"><text>I've seen many such doors already. So I'm curious. Don't you know where it leads?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_dialog_3"><text>Maybe I know, maybe I don't. You... would... bring a couple bottles to keep the conversation going. That way, it might come back faster - what, why and where.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_dialog_4"><text>Just a couple bottles, no problem. Wait.</text></string>

<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_0"><text>I'm about the door?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_1"><text>What did we agree on there?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_2"><text>This sweet thing here - take it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_3"><text>Since you treated me right, I'll tell you something. That door leads somewhere into the catacombs. Into the underground... Our guys never opened it - Lukash forbade it. They say there's shitloads of monsters in there and other nasty stuff! We take turns standing guard here, making sure no evil shit crawls out of there. And from time to time something bangs and knocks from inside... And howls! Sometimes it gives you the creeps... Especially at night. If it was up to me, I'd blow this whole fucking tunnel remnant to hell so you couldn't even see this door!</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_4"><text>So why don't you blow it up then, what's the big deal.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_5"><text>It's not that simple, pal.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_6"><text>And Lukash, what about him? Does he know something? Why did he forbid opening it? Maybe I should ask him?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_7"><text>I heard bits and pieces that this door was blocked by the military back in the day. But some people at the top still have some interest here. Recently their representative was pretty direct about it: we're only tolerated here as guards of this very passage. That's how things are... So forget about it. And better not bother Lukash with questions about why and what for. Those who doubted the correctness of his orders aren't doubting anything anymore, their bones are lying all over the Zone, white and clean...</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_8"><text>What kind of representative, where can I find him? Maybe he knows something?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_9"><text>I won't tell you that. And I only overheard that conversation by accident from my guard post, just when I had to take a piss.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_10"><text>Does this representative come here often?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_11"><text>I don't know, I've only seen him a couple times and from a distance at that. The brass rarely comes here. But this time we had... an incident. A couple-three weeks ago, the lights on the code lock panel suddenly started blinking. I reported it to Lukash, he got real worked up, chewed me out with profanity, though I never understood what for. And the next day, that's when they had this conversation here, in the tunnel. Something's not clean here, oh something's not clean.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_12"><text>A couple-three weeks ago... interesting. Alright, I'll go.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_13"><text>So maybe one for the road... little roulette?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_2dialog_14"><text>Is that some kind of joke?</text></string>

<string id="ivancov_mil_2dialog_0"><text>I'm here about those doors at the warehouses.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_2dialog_1"><text>So you're ready, or is it "find someone else" again?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_2dialog_2"><text>I had a chat with that schemer. He didn't tell me anything special. Says the door leads to some underground area, that sometimes monsters break out from there. The Freedomers guard it on Lukash's orders, but he himself doesn't know why. Naturally, I didn't bother Lukash with such... trifles. Otherwise we wouldn't be talking right now.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_2dialog_3"><text>All of this is already known to me. Or are you holding something back?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_2dialog_4"><text>What would be the point? Where this door leads, only Lukash might know, and even then, I'm not sure. Zubr said the Freedomers never went down there. Though recently they had a small incident, the code lock showed "signs of life". Lukash, as Pavlo says, got very agitated.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_2dialog_5"><text>So you say they never went down this one... But they went to the underground at Radar for some reason...</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_2dialog_6"><text>You know about that too?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_2dialog_7"><text>I know about it, but I can't get an answer. According to my information, the door at the warehouses was non-functional, just like the one at Radar. But after someone, maybe even you, visited one of the Radar laboratories, the code lock activated.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_2dialog_8"><text>That's how it turned out. Maybe I activated something there, maybe someone else did.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_2dialog_9"><text>No desire to check where this door leads?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_2dialog_10"><text>If it's the place I'm thinking of, then I'll try, let's see what happens. If, of course, the Freedomers in that tunnel don't waste me.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_2dialog_11"><text>Try to make sure they don't waste you. The code for that door should be 86573, if Docent didn't mess up. And this is for the road.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_2dialog_12"><text>See ya... cop. Maybe I'll be back.</text></string>

<string id="mil_minigame_door_3dialog_0"><text>Hey there, Pavlo! Need to talk.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_3dialog_1"><text>We can always talk, especially with some good snacks, we could have a real nice sit-down.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_3dialog_2"><text>That's for later. This is serious business... I want to try to crack open that damn door.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_3dialog_3"><text>You gone crazy?! Making fireworks here. Lukash and his goons will turn us into sieves and feed the minced meat to the dogs.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_3dialog_4"><text>I'll do it quietly. I have the code for this door.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_3dialog_5"><text>Code... from where?! Who gave it? You sure?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_3dialog_6"><text>Sure or not sure - we'll find out when we try. And who gave it - better you don't know.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_3dialog_7"><text>Marked One, you understand what'll happen to you and me if they catch us.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_3dialog_8"><text>So think of something so they don't catch us. Pavlo, I really need this, try to help.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_3dialog_9"><text>Well, alright. I have one idea... We'll throw a little party. Everyone will come running for free drinks and snacks, guards included. Only... it'll cost something.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_3dialog_10"><text>I'm used to that by now. Tell me, how much and what?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_3dialog_11"><text>Quick on the uptake. I need to figure out who can drink how much, to make sure. Short version, I think... ten bottles of vodka should be enough for us, well, and the same amount of canned food. If needed, we'll roll a joint to round things out. And for me, for being clever, an artifact, level three. Like winnings from roulette, and it'll give us an excuse for the party too.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_3dialog_12"><text>You'll get your reward for being clever, and snacks with drinks.</text></string>

<string id="mil_minigame_door_4dialog_0"><text>Hey Pavlo, how's the game, any winnings?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_4dialog_1"><text>You came here to grin like an idiot or... on business.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_4dialog_2"><text>On business, on business. I gathered everything as we agreed.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_4dialog_3"><text>And the artifact?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_4dialog_4"><text>You'll get your artifact when you fulfill your part of the deal.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_4dialog_51"><text>Don't trust me... Well, that's right. I think by night the guys will be pretty wasted, so come around, nobody will bother you.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_4dialog_52"><text>Don't trust me... Well, that's right. I think if we start drinking in the evening, by night the guys will be pretty wasted, so come around, nobody will bother you.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_4dialog_6"><text>By night... well that's clear.</text></string>

<string id="mil_minigame_door_5dialog_0"><text>How are the guys, ready?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_5dialog_1"><text>Good party turned out, soulful. Now they'll start howling songs, you'll be able to hear it at Radar. You brought the artifact?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_5dialog_21"><text>Will this one work?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_5dialog_22"><text>I had one, just a sec.</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_5dialog_3"><text>Not really great, but as they say - when there's no fish... So are you really going to crawl in there?</text></string>
<string id="mil_minigame_door_5dialog_4"><text>Did you doubt it? I've got issues... with my head, everyone knows that.</text></string>

<string id="ivancov_mil_3dialog_0"><text>You don't seem too happy to see me.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_3dialog_1"><text>Why would you say that, quite the opposite. How did it go?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_3dialog_2"><text>The code worked, found myself in the Radar lab. I won't describe the lab's charms.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_3dialog_3"><text>That's good. Means the data from the disks can be trusted.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_3dialog_4"><text>And if I hadn't returned, how would you have resolved your doubts?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_3dialog_5"><text>Believe me, Marked One, with you or without you, we would have solved this task.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_3dialog_6"><text>Sounds familiar... The price of a stalker's hide is less than the price of a dog's tail.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_3dialog_7"><text>We'll still talk about your price. What else interests me though. When Voronin sent you to waste those guys at Yantar, didn't he say why the hell... they went so far that they got caught under the emission?</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_3dialog_8"><text>Sakharov explained that at certain times the emitter's effect is safe for passing through the factory territory. Maybe they mistimed it? Or...</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_3dialog_9"><text>Exactly, or... So, Sakharov. Good, we'll think about it. You're free for now, if I need you, I'll let you know. Take some ammo, it'll come in handy.</text></string>
<string id="ivancov_mil_3dialog_10"><text>And that's it? Hmm...</text></string>

<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_0"><text>Hey there, science! Got your message and rushed over as soon as I could. Lay it on me, what's the news?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_1"><text>Haven't even caught your breath properly yet, and you're already ready to get down to business - I respect that. Well then, I won't beat around the bush either. Remember our last conversation? You asked whether I know how to distinguish a "natural" artifact, born by the Zone, from an artificial one, "cooked", to use stalker terminology.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_2"><text>Yeah, there was something like that. Though it's not entirely clear to me what the hell's the point of distinguishing them at all. Or, to use scientific terminology, what's the practical benefit of such knowledge?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_3"><text>Wise guy! What if I tell you that "natural" artifacts have, let's call it, strong affinity to the anomalies that spawned them, and can store residual traces of electromagnetic disturbances caused by...</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_4"><text>Hold on, stop! You scientists always try to make our stalker brothers feel like insects. Ever try speaking simpler?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_5"><text>Oh, well, alright. An anomaly, when "birthing" an artifact, leaves its trace on it, characteristic specifically to that type of anomaly. This trace, though it fades gradually, can nevertheless persist for quite a long time if the object remains at rest. Even if the parent anomaly disappeared after an emission, collapsed from external interference, or simply faded over time, its trace on the artifact can continue to emit intensively across a fairly wide dia... uh, sorry. Generally, a situation where the anomaly is gone but its trace remains is more the norm than the exception. How are you following my train of thought so far, Marked One?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_6"><text>I'm following, I'm following. And what does this have to do with distinguishing "natural" artifacts from "unnatural" ones? You're saying that this trace is absent on "cooked" artifacts, right?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_7"><text>You've grasped the very essence, exactly! Though of course, my scientific conscience doesn't allow me to make such a categorical conclusion. I'd choose a more careful formulation - the trace is either absent, or has a different nature and cannot be detected by current means. Why is this? I don't even have a working hypothesis yet, but the fact remains.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_8"><text>Wait, wait. Detected by means, you said...</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_9"><text>Aha, now we've come to the main point. To the practical benefit, as you put it. You're surely aware of the existence of portable anomaly detectors. These devices are manufactured on the mainland, in classified research institutes, though simple contraptions have even been mastered by local craftsmen. Ivan Sergeyevich managed to secure several of the most advanced models currently available for our needs, and I, according to the latest data obtained, including what you brought, reconfigured one of these devices so it reacts not to anomalies, but to the traces left by them.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_10"><text>So it turns out... turns out you managed to create an artifact detector, right? And it works?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_11"><text>Well, create is putting it too strongly. I merely, I repeat, reconfigured an existing model. But essentially - correct. This is the first experimental prototype of an artifact detector. "Natural" artifacts, don't forget. And whether it works - that's what I want to ask you to determine through field testing.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_12"><text>So you want to give me this device, like, for field trials? And what should I do with it? How does it even work?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_131"><text>Listen and remember. The device is charged and fully ready for operation. Due to the frequency scanning changes, the battery drains like crazy, but it should last 5 days guaranteed. The detector should be placed as far as possible from those stalker belts of yours - you carry artifacts on them under voltage, and that creates strong interference on the working frequencies. A backpack, for obvious reasons, also won't work. The ideal option is a separate spacious pocket on tactical gear, roughly at shoulder level. Uh... but you don't have one like that. That's a problem. Listen, I know the military can trade excellent tactical gear with lots of compartments and pockets. I heard that on the Cordon there's a certain Major Kuznetsov on duty, he supposedly gets along with stalkers. Maybe you could try to make a deal with them, eh? I really wouldn't want to look for another executor, since we've already worked together and my trust in you is complete.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_132"><text>Listen and remember. The device is charged and fully ready for operation. Due to the frequency scanning changes, the battery drains like crazy, but it should last 5 days guaranteed. The detector should be placed as far as possible from those stalker belts of yours - you carry artifacts on them under voltage, and that creates strong interference on the working frequencies. A backpack, for obvious reasons, also won't work. The ideal option is a separate spacious pocket on tactical gear, roughly at shoulder level. Like this one of yours - perfect! And then everything's simple. You head out on a hunt... or whatever you call an expedition for artifacts, and listen carefully for whether the device starts making audio signals.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_1411"><text>You're serious about the pockets right now? Mhm... I can see in your eyes that you're serious. Alright, I'll meet you halfway. You've really intrigued me. Wait here, I'll be quick.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_1412"><text>Damn it! So much hassle over some pocket. No, Gluzov, sorry, but I don't have time for such nonsense. No offense.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_142"><text>And if it starts, then there's an artifact nearby? So it'll beep non-stop, since I constantly carry artifacts with me. Well, suppose I go empty-handed. But what if I stop at a stalker camp for the night and someone there has an artifact in their backpack? What if I visit Sidorovich? He probably has a whole warehouse for them... No, this is some kind of bullshit.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_15"><text>Marked One, do you really think I would suggest you test the device under such conditions? If you were listening carefully, you surely noticed my words about how the trace on an artifact can persist for a long time as long as the object is at rest. So, by "at rest" I didn't mean that the artifact lies motionless on the ground, but that its pristine energy balance isn't disturbed by external interference. To make it clearer: say you found a jellyfish, picked it up, and you get zapped by something on the noggin, like electricity. Sound familiar, right? This is the external manifestation of a disrupted energy circuit. You could say, a rupture in the shell. Along with the energy discharge, the trace fades too. Curiously, by the way, such a reaction is caused specifically by interaction with the human body. Zone spawn, anomalies, or, say, inanimate physical objects don't cause a similar effect when in contact with artifacts. There's no such effect with artificially obtained artifacts either, since they're initially energetically neutral, so humans can touch them without fear of getting shocked.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_16"><text>Oh, wow! So the detector will only beep on "natural" artifacts that haven't been touched by humans yet? That's a completely different story! And how far can it detect an artifact?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_17"><text>Approximately within a 30-meter radius. The closer to the detected object, the more intense the audio signal will be. For the completeness of the experiment, I want you to find with my device 3 level-1 artifacts, 2 level-2 artifacts, and also any artifact capsule, and bring these finds to me. Yes, and don't you dare use them, the artifacts must be in perfect condition. Agree, not the most difficult task, right? Just walk around the Zone, do your business, just don't forget to listen to the detector.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_18"><text>Well, on paper it's certainly not difficult, and your interest in all this is clear to me. If things are as you describe, then the inventor of such a device needn't worry about his future career. Honor, respect and all that. But what do I get? After all, I'm the one who'll have to risk my life again. Those same capsules don't just lie around on the road, you have to venture deep into the Zone for them.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_19"><text>A fair question. We have some off-budget funds for various occasions. I think I can convince Ivan Sergeyevich to allocate a certain sum for your reward. I suspect dollars are useless to you in the Zone, right? But with this money we can order some unique weapon for you through Demian from the mainland, he has the right connections. Will that work?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_20"><text>Yeah, money doesn't particularly interest me, but a good gun could come in very handy. We've sorted that out. If that's everything, then I'm ready to shake on it.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_21"><text>There's one more little thing... You see, Marked One, the thing is that in a week there'll be a very prestigious scientific conference in Kiev. It took Ivan Sergeyevich great effort to convince the leadership to send me there from our institute. As an advance, so to speak. I'll have to give a presentation there on my... our research with you. A presentation of the first experimental artifact detector is also planned... well, you understand.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_22"><text>Ah, that's what it is. So you've already decided everything in advance, planned it all out, just one tiny detail left - convince some sucker stalker to quickly, in a week, finish all the necessary tests, right?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_23"><text>Honestly, I need to manage it in 5 days max. I still need to double-check all the data and prepare... Uh... I mean I want to say that I don't consider you a sucker at all and I'm very grateful for everything you've already done. But understand - such a chance comes once in a lifetime. I just couldn't pass it up, but I was afraid to tell you everything straight away. I thought, what if you, learning about such urgency, wouldn't even listen to me further. And I really have no one else to turn to... Please, Marked One, help me one last time.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_241"><text>Well, alright. I'll see it through to the end since I'm already mixed up in all this. Just make sure, Gluzov, that your presentation definitely mentions the name of your main consultant - mine. Just kidding. I don't even remember my name anyway...</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_242"><text>In five days?! Are you out of your mind, guy? Sometimes you wander the Zone all day and don't find a single artifact, and you need 6 pieces, including a capsule. No way, forget it! Figure it out yourself, if you're so smart... going to a conference, look at that.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_25"><text>Here, thank you! You can't even imagine how much this means to me! Here, take the detector. I'll be eagerly awaiting your return. By the way, I'm aware of your memory problems, people told me... I have one idea where they might be able to help you, but we'll talk about that later, okay?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_26"><text>Alright. I'm already used to the fact that nobody in the Zone will even tell you the time for free. See you, Gluzov.</text></string>
<string id="tex_detector_quest_article"><text>Gluzov asked me to conduct field tests of an artifact detector for him. Using the device provided, I need to find 3 level-1 artifacts, 2 level-2 artifacts, and any capsule, then deliver all this to the graduate student. Using the finds is forbidden, they must be in perfect condition. Considering that the customer will soon have to leave the Zone, no more than 5 days is allotted for everything.</text></string>

<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_re_0"><text>Here, got new tactical gear from the military. Now we're good?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_start_dialog_re_1"><text>Excellent, perfect! Shall we continue the briefing? As I already said, the detector is charged and fully ready for operation. The battery is guaranteed to last at least 5 days. You put the device in this upper pocket of the tactical gear, and then everything's simple. You head out on a hunt... or whatever you call an expedition for artifacts, and listen carefully for whether the device starts making audio signals.</text></string>

<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_0"><text>Hey, Gluzov! News - not news, but I want to tell you something.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_1"><text>Yes? Did something happen?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_21"><text>Ha, you went pale! Relax, science, the job's done.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_22"><text>No, just nothing to cheer about yet. But I decided to drop by since I happened to be nearby. Just to confirm that I remember everything, the deal stands.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_23"><text>You could say that. I changed my mind about doing this job, I've got troubles up to my eyeballs, sorry. I'm returning your device. I hope you have enough time to hire someone else for this work.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_31"><text>Done? Aw, well done! Give me the detector quickly, and put the artifacts right here.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_32"><text>I understand. Please hurry, there's not much time left.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_33"><text>I didn't expect this from you, Marked One... I don't even know what to say. What am I supposed to do now?! Alright, go, I need to collect my thoughts.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_411"><text>Why are you getting all worked up? Here, everything's accounted for...</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_412"><text>Uh... seems like everything was in the backpack, did I lay it out?! Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back!</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_5"><text>So-so... what do we have in the device's memory? Aha... that's correct... yes, all artifacts are normal. Amazing...</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_6"><text>Hey, Gluzov, are you even here? What are you muttering under your breath?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_7"><text>What? Oh... I just had to make sure right away... anyway, you did excellently, Marked One! I knew I could count on you. The detector worked properly, were there any problems?</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_8"><text>There's always plenty of problems! From hordes of beasts wanting to dine on me, to chafed blisters - they slipped me crappy boots again... Hmm, but the detector was in perfect order, everything according to instructions. Alright, now let's move on to your promises, if you don't mind.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_9"><text>Of course, of course! Look what they brought for you - looks impressive, right? I'm no expert in these matters, but Demian was just clicking his tongue enviously when they delivered your package.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_101"><text>Yea-ah... fine piece of equipment, no question. You also mentioned that you know where they might help me restore my memory.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_102"><text>Yea-ah... fine piece of equipment, no question. But... Let's better give this gun to Demian as a gift, and get me something from your scientific department, something practical. And you also mentioned that you know where they might help me restore my memory.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_103"><text>Yea-ah... fine piece of equipment, no question. But... To be honest, I was hoping you'd leave me this detector of yours. It's a very useful thing in the stalker trade.\nAnd also, let me remind you, you mentioned that you know where they might help me restore my memory.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_111"><text>Rather - I suppose. If everything goes smoothly at the conference, and I manage to make the right impression on the right people, I think we can arrange... a special service for you. Later, when there's news, I'll find a way to send you word. I can only say in advance that it might cost big money. So in your place I'd worry ahead of time about preparing for serious financial expenses.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_112"><text>I thought you'd like this gun... Give it back then. And what should I offer you instead? I think I know! A friend recently shared with me a method of obtaining a most curious, extremely rare artifact "Jumper". Enhanced athletic abilities of the wearer, as easily understood from the name, are only one manifestation of its properties. Rumor has it that with its help you can also overcome complex anomalies like "Labyrinth". I haven't checked it myself, of course, but I think you'd find it interesting.\nAs for help with memory restoration... If everything goes smoothly at the conference, and I manage to make the right impression on the right people, I think we can arrange... a special service for you. Later, when there's news, I'll find a way to send you word. I can only say in advance that it might cost big money. So in your place I'd worry ahead of time about preparing for serious financial expenses.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_113"><text>I thought you'd like this gun... Give it back then. And the detector... Sorry, but I can't leave it with you. The thing is, it will be part of my presentation at the conference. Material evidence, if you will. But, you know... I could send you not just the same device in about a week, but a new, improved model. I was working on this prototype in parallel, so it's almost ready. They'll deliver it to Pakhom's warehouse, and he'll let you know. You could test it, and then scribble a review, sending it to me through the same Pakhom. Does such an option work?\nAs for help with memory restoration... If everything goes smoothly at the conference, and I manage to make the right impression on the right people, I think we can arrange... a special service for you. Later, when there's news, I'll find a way to send you word. I can only say in advance that it might cost big money. So in your place I'd worry ahead of time about preparing for serious financial expenses.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_121"><text>That's some help - you still have to pay through the nose for it! I'll think about whether I even need such a "service". But thanks anyway for participating.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_122"><text>That's some help - you still have to pay through the nose for it! I'll think about whether I even need such a "service". But thanks anyway for participating. And for the recipe too. Definitely useful.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_123"><text>That's some help - you still have to pay through the nose for it! I'll think about whether I even need such a "service". But thanks anyway for participating. And I like your offer about the improved detector. We'll settle on that.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_13"><text>Thank you for everything! What would I do without you... Looks like it's time to say goodbye, a helicopter should arrive soon, and I still need to pack my things. I don't think I'll return to the Zone. At least not in the foreseeable future. Well, stay healthy, Marked One! And wait for word.</text></string>
<string id="detector_quest_done_dialog_14"><text>You stay well too, Gluzov. Good luck at the conference!</text></string>

<string id="pahom_gluzov_reward_dialog_0"><text>Rushed over at your call, Pakhom, about the package from Gluzov. I hope this is what I think it is?</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_reward_dialog_1"><text>How should I know what you're thinking? I was told to give you this device and explain how to use it.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_reward_dialog_2"><text>Excellent! I've been waiting for it for a long time. I was starting to doubt whether Gluzov forgot about me...</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_reward_dialog_3"><text>As you can see, the guy keeps his word. So, wait, now I'll find the accompanying letter and read the instructions...</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_reward_dialog_4"><text>So, maybe just give me the letter, and I'll figure it out myself?</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_reward_dialog_5"><text>It's not addressed to you personally. There's something written here for me, and Ivan Sergeyevich, and Demian, and other guys. Besides, you and I need to clarify one more point afterward.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_reward_dialog_6"><text>Alright, as you say. Then read it.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_reward_dialog_7"><text>The "EDA - M2" detector uses the so-called "similarity principle" in its operation, which consists of comparing the structure of the scanned object with available samples. For this, a special substance is used, manufactured to order at a defense enterprise near Kiev, and consisting of microscopic particles of anomalous formations brought from the Zone. This substance is placed in a replaceable cartridge, from which it enters... Well, such details are unlikely to interest you. The main thing you should understand is that the substance in these cartridges is consumed during detector activation, and when it runs out, the device will stop working. You can track how full the cartridge is using this scale. Let's continue.\nUnlike the previous model, this device is equipped with a screen that displays all detected artifacts, which significantly simplifies their search. Each class of artifacts has its own color marker. Moreover, the detector now reacts not only to natural artifacts, but also to those of artificial origin, and not lying in containers, backpacks and other items that shield them from scanning. To start the detector's active mode, you should take it in your hands and press the "ON" button. For passive mode operation, it's enough to place the device in a tactical gear pocket. In this case, like the first model, the device will start making an audio signal, indicating the detection of an artifact nearby.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_reward_dialog_8"><text>Oh, how! Well, everything seems clear. And that point you wanted to clarify afterward concerns how to revive a detector that's run out of that substance, am I right?</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_reward_dialog_9"><text>Smart pioneer. As you've already understood, replacement cartridges for this detector, or rather, the substance in them - costs extremely expensive. We can't afford to spend funds on this, but... There are always options. For example, process a payment under a different category. This requires strong justification, but you seem to already know what can interest us. I think in exchange for the cartridge replacement service, a part from some rare mutant would work. I'll be more specific when you actually come with this problem. Questions?</text></string>
<string id="pahom_gluzov_reward_dialog_10"><text>Bloodsuckers have no questions. Just kidding. Got it, no... No?</text></string>

<string id="pahom_detector_charge_dlg_0"><text>I'd like to replace the cartridge in the artifact detector.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_detector_charge_dlg_1"><text>I knew you'd show up about this soon, so I ordered one in advance. As I warned, for this service I'll ask you to get a part from a rare mutant. Right now our scientific brotherhood needs: </text></string>
<string id="pahom_detector_charge_dlg_21"><text>I have such a part, take it.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_detector_charge_dlg_22"><text>Your scientific brotherhood will have to wait while I go hunting.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_detector_charge_dlg_3"><text>Yeah, just what we need. Put the detector here.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_detector_charge_dlg_4"><text>How long do I have to wait?</text></string>
<string id="pahom_detector_charge_dlg_5"><text>It'll be ready in about ten minutes. Just don't stomp around here, I need to concentrate. The work isn't complicated, but it's meticulous.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_detector_charge_dlg_6"><text>Alright, I'll take a walk for now.</text></string>

<string id="pahom_detector_charge_end_dlg_0"><text>How's it going with the detector, did you replace the cartridge?</text></string>
<string id="pahom_detector_charge_end_dlg_11"><text>Yes, here you go. Come again.</text></string>
<string id="pahom_detector_charge_end_dlg_12"><text>What an impatient person. I said - in ten minutes. And how much time has passed, can you count?</text></string>
<string id="pahom_detector_charge_end_dlg_2"><text>Thank you. Definitely.</text></string>

<string id="mil_torch_upgr_start_dlg_0"><text>Greetings. I have a question. I know that you military guys are supposed to have tons of spare components for gear and equipment. I'm interested in armor plates. Can we make a deal?</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_start_dlg_1"><text>Hmm... What do you need them for, soldier? They're hardly likely to fit your suit. And I'm not sure they haven't been completely cleaned out from the warehouse already.</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_start_dlg_2"><text>It's not for me. There's this skilled guy who does equipment repairs for stalkers. He has a big order burning from Duty. Says he's short of plates to fix three more suits, minimum. So is there still an option to get them?</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_start_dlg_31"><text>An order from Duty? I've heard of them. They're listed among our "sympathizers". Here's the deal. I won't promise you plates, but I'll give the order to bring three used body armor sets here in an hour. I'll give them for 5 bottles each. Your master can then pick off what he needs from them. But there's one condition.\nFurther north from our post, on a hill, wild boars have made themselves at home. This neighborhood extremely unnerves my boys. Deal with the mutant problem, and you'll get your armor. Do you have a stalker PDA? Let me mark the lair on the map. So, deal?</text></string>

But there's one condition.\nTo the south of this place, on a hill and in the lowland adjacent to the perimeter fence, wild boars have made themselves at home. This neighborhood extremely unnerves me. Deal with the mutant problem, and you'll get your armor. Do you have a stalker PDA? Let me mark the lair on the map. So, deal?</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_start_dlg_4"><text>Come back in an hour, but first deal with the boars. Have five bottles of vodka for each armor set. Fine, this arrangement works for me.</text></string>

<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_0"><text>How about those body armor sets? Have they been delivered?</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_11"><text>Yeah, I have them. Did you do what I asked?</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_12"><text>You came too early. Come back later.</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_211"><text>The boar lair is cleared out. You can go check for yourself.</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_212"><text>I'm just about to do that. First I wanted to make sure everything's ready for the "deal of the century".</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_22"><text>Alright. What should I do with myself in the meantime?!</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_3"><text>I'll take your word for it anyway. No stomping, no grunting, no other commotion from that direction, so everything's in order.\nLet's get down to business now. Everything as agreed: 5 bottles for one armor set. You taking them?</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_41"><text>Here's the thing... Basically, I only need one armor set. A thousand apologies. Here's the vodka.</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_42"><text>It turned out that I only need two armor sets. Don't be mad. I'm putting down half a case of the clear stuff, according to the price list.</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_43"><text>Yes, I'm taking all three. Here's your "firewater".</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_44"><text>Damn, totally forgot about the vodka. I'll be right back.</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_51"><text>As you wish, it's your business. Keep in mind, I'm not going to haul them back and forth. Here's your armor set. We're done with this.</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_52"><text>As you wish, it's your business. Keep in mind, I'm not going to haul them back and forth. Here are your armor sets. We're done with this.</text></string>
<string id="mil_torch_upgr_done_dlg_53"><text>Excellent. Take your body armor sets.</text></string>
