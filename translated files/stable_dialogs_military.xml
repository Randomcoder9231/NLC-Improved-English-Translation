<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_0"><text>What do you want?</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_1"><text>I need to see your leader, Lukash. I have extremely important information for him.</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_2"><text>Is this where Lukash and Shinkar are staying? I'd like to speak with one of them. Your guys sent me here.</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_3"><text>Just looking around...</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_10"><text>And what's so important?</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_20"><text>Can you be more specific?</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_11"><text>A Duty squad is hanging around nearby; your patrol spotted them. They asked me to relay the details to the Freedom leader in person.</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_21"><text>I'm looking for information about Strelok or someone from his group. Also, I wouldn't turn down some work if we can strike a deal.</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_12"><text>Whoa... Go on in, but don't even think about causing trouble here: they'll carry you out feet first. You'll find Lukash on the second floor.\nAnd keep in mind, if you're spinning a yarn about Duty just to get inside, you'd better say so now and beat it. If you do, I'll pretend this conversation never happened.</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_22"><text>Alright, go on in. Just don't think about causing trouble: they'll carry you out feet first.</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_131"><text>Why would I bother with such nonsense? My words are easy to verify; just contact your patrols.</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_132"><text>Uh... well, yeah, I made it up a bit. I don't have any particularly valuable information... actually, it's the opposite—I'm looking for info myself. I figured your leader would be the most knowledgeable person here. That's why I wanted to talk to him first. I can pay for information... or I could carry out an assignment for you.</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_4"><text>Fine.</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_141"><text>Fine, go. But know this: in 15 minutes, I'm checking in with Lukash over the radio. If it turns out you haven't shown up to report, you'll have only yourself to blame.</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_142"><text>Look at you, singing a different tune... Alright, I'm feeling generous today. We've got a drinking session with some shashlik planned for tonight, and you can't go into that in a bad mood... Plus, you didn't try to keep dodging and weaving, so you can go in. They'll keep an eye on you inside, just in case...</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_151"><text>Just let me pass already, will you?</text></string>
<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_152"><text>Whatever you say. And... thanks.</text></string>

<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_101"><text>Hello, stalker. I am Major Cherepanov of Duty; we are carrying out a mission in this territory. Would you like to join us?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1011"><text>They call me the Marked One. What exactly are you planning here?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1021"><text>I don't, but I'm actually here on business. Your boss asked me to give you some funny numbers.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1012"><text>Just over the hill is the main breeding ground for those Freedom scumbags, which my boys and I are about to stir up properly.\nThere is, however, a small problem. There is only one entrance to the base, and it's heavily guarded. We thought about blowing a hole in the fence, but their sniper on the tower is in our way. I don't want to send my men into the line of fire... But he'll let you get close; he definitely won't shoot right away. Take him out and we'll make it worth your while—plus, you can take whatever gear you want from the base if the job succeeds.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1022"><text>What boss? Voronin? I don't give a damn about him... In short—I don't care about his orders!</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1013"><text>Uh... where does this confidence come from that he'll let me get close? You don't want to risk your own, but you don't mind sending me into the line of fire?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_10131"><text>There isn't even a sniper on that tower; open your eyes...</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_10132"><text>Really? Indeed... well then, sorry for the trouble. I won't suggest you join us on the raid; you aren't trained in our tactics, you don't know the commands, and anyway—this isn't your war.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_10133"><text>I didn't really want to anyway...</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1023"><text>No, a different one. Name's Ivantsov.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1014"><text>Well... you're not one of us. That's why the Freedomer won't think twice. Anyway, I've already said it: all you need to do is pick off the sniper on the tower behind the fence.\nSo, how about it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1024"><text>And what did he pass on? Don't drag it out... uh... what was your name, by the way?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1015"><text>No, I don't want to be a part of this. It smells like a suicide mission. And besides... wetwork isn't really my thing.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1035"><text>Hold on... I'm such a blockhead! I'm actually here on an assignment from your superior. He asked me to pass along some numbers.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1025"><text>The name's Marked One. I was told to relay this: twenty-nine. Something about the thirteenth and eighth having moved out. He didn't say where. And why "Svyat"?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1016"><text>Then don't get under our feet, Marked One. Be on your way...</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1036"><text>What superior? Voronin? I don't give a damn about him... In short—I don't care about his orders!</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1026"><text>Twenty-ni-i-ine. I see. And Svyat—it's short for Svyatoslav. That's his name. Listen up. If you see him, tell him: Skull understood everything. Tell him: seven, seventy-two. Got it? Then he'll spare some supplies for you. Well, and... thanks. We'll put our heads together and figure out our next move here.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1017"><text>With great pleasure.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1037"><text>No, a different one. Name's Ivantsov.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1027"><text>Oh! Kindergarten games again. Take care!</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1038"><text>Svyat? And what did he pass on? Don't drag it out, it's very important.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_1039"><text>I was told to relay: twenty-nine. Something about the thirteenth and eighth having moved out. He didn't say where. And why "Svyat"?</text></string>

<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_201"><text>Why are you constantly hovering around? If you don't want to prove yourself in a real mission, then get lost and take a walk.</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_301"><text>Anything else, Marked One?</text></string>
<string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_401"><text>Look, just move along... You see how many real men have laid down their lives here...</text></string>

<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_0"><text>What is this place?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_1"><text>We call it the Barrier... and that's pretty much what it is, in principle. Consider it the last normal checkpoint before the center of the Zone. It's a buffer, you know, between humanity and the darkness of the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_2"><text>And what's further ahead?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_3"><text>Further ahead is only death... well, or service to "Monolith." "Our Monolith! In thy name!.." Pfft!.. \nIn short, no one should go there. That's why we stand here, making sure no filth floods the Zone... We also hold back the particularly stupid ones. At least, we try to make sure they don't poke their noses toward the center.</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_4"><text>Why do you do this?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_5"><text>If not us, then who? "Duty"? They are experts at exterminating monsters and undesirable stalkers, but just try to make them do something actually useful! Do you see them here? No? Exactly my point. We, for example, don't set a goal to destroy every creature living here. A barrier, a proper Barrier—that will be enough. The main thing is that neither side crosses the line...</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_6"><text>And what if someone does cross it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_freedom_commander_common2_7"><text>Anything can happen. Anything. I don't want to talk about it...</text></string>

<string id="mil_guard_arsenal_dialog_0"><text>Halt! Access to the arsenal is permitted only to members of Freedom.</text></string>
<string id="mil_guard_arsenal_dialog_1"><text>Chill out, you poor soul...</text></string>
<!-- Óãðþìûé -->
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_101"><text>And what brought you to this godforsaken place, stalker? Better beat it while you still can!</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_102"><text>Just passing through... I'm looking for something and wanted to look around. What's so scary about this place?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_103"><text>Ah, look around... So it's your first time here. Well, that's different then... We're waiting for someone; a signal came from the village. But God only knows what's going on in that village! Vlad said he saw bloodsuckers here. Though, he might have been joking...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_104"><text>Bloodsuckers? Did you see them?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_105"><text>No. Vlad and Yuras headed towards the water tower... We're just sitting here for now, waiting. Go ahead and take a walk, don't be afraid, since you want to look around.\nEverything seems quiet, just those poltergeists floating about. And listen... if you find anything interesting, let us know later.</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_106"><text>How kind of you... Alright, I'm going.</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_151"><text>Is that you making all that noise? Scaring off the bloodsuckers?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_152"><text>Just passing through... Looking for something, wanted to check the area. Yeah, I saw the bloodsuckers, gave them a proper scare. What about it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_153"><text>So you saw them? We're waiting for someone here; a signal came from the village. But God knows what's happening in that village! Vlad said he saw bloodsuckers here too... He and Yuras went to scout it out. You just keep going where you were going, look around. And listen... If you find anything interesting, let us know later.</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_154"><text>Brave souls... Alright, I'm going.</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_301"><text>Well? Any luck?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_302"><text>You guys are... "jokers." Nothing scary, my foot! I barely made it out alive! There are bloodsuckers all over the place.</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_303"><text>Whoa! No kidding! Well, man, you owe us one for staying alive! By the way, did you find anything interesting there? Maybe... a curious corpse or something.</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_304"><text>Joking again? Thanks... I didn't find anything.</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_401"><text>Why are you wandering around here like a ghost?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_402"><text>Just looking around.</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_501"><text>Oh! Hey, man! What are you scouting for? Looking for someone?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_502"><text>Just looking for something... Why?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_503"><text>Couldn't find a better spot? This might be the shittiest place in the Zone...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_504"><text>What's so bad about it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_505"><text>You don't know? So it's your first time here... Hmm...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_506"><text>So, you don't actually know yourselves?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_507"><text>No. Vlad and Yuras headed towards the water tower... and we're just sitting here for now, waiting. Go ahead and take a walk, don't worry, since you want to look around...\nEverything seems quiet, just those poltergeists floating about...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_508"><text>Bloodsuckers, you say? Hmm...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_601"><text>Damn, you really brought the heat! You've got skills!</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_602"><text>What are you talking about?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_603"><text>Well... we saw how you handled those bloodsuckers... Tough, very tough, I'll give you ?that. By any chance, did you see our guys there? Yuras and Vlad headed to the water tower this morning...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_604"><text>No, I didn't see them. I only saw some corpses.</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_605"><text>Corpses, huh... Well, that's what we figured. Was there a metal briefcase by any chance? You never know... If you happen to come across it, stop by and see our man Shinkar; he was really torn up about the loss...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_606"><text>Shinkar? Who's that?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_607"><text>He's our trader, sits at the base counting his cash... buys artifacts from stalkers, peddles gear... in short, a businessman. You'll find out for yourself what a nice guy he is...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_701"><text>Whoa! Now that's what I'm talking about! You've got skills! The way you took those bastards down...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_702"><text>Are you joking?! I just got lucky; I barely made it out alive!</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_703"><text>Oho, you really brought the heat! Listen... how are our guys? Did you see them?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_704"><text>Yeah, I saw them... or what was left of them...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_705"><text>I see... Was there a metal briefcase by any chance? Just in case... If you find it, head over to our Shinkar; he was incredibly upset about losing it...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_7061"><text>Shinkar? Who's that?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_7062"><text>To Shinkar? Yeah, sure thing...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_707"><text>He's our trader, sits at the base counting his cash... buys artifacts from stalkers, peddles gear... in short, a businessman. You'll find out for yourself what a nice guy he is...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_751"><text>Well? Finished looking around? You're a lucky one...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_752"><text>Yeah, I'm looking... You guys are real jokers.</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_801"><text>Oh! Hey, man! What are you scouting for? Looking for someone?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_802"><text>Just looking for something... Why?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_803"><text>Couldn't find a better spot? This might be the shittiest place in the Zone...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_804"><text>What's so bad about it?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_805"><text>You don't know? So it's your first time here... Hmm... We're waiting for a guy here, our designated marksman. Íî God only knows what's going on in that village! Vlad said he saw bloodsuckers here... though, he might have been joking... There's nothing bad there, I was just kidding. And listen... if you find anything interesting, let us know later.</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_806"><text>So you don't actually know yourselves?</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_807"><text>No. Vlad and Yuras headed towards the water tower... and we're just sitting here for now, waiting. Go ahead and take a walk, don't worry, since you want to look around...\nEverything seems quiet, just those poltergeists floating about...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_808"><text>Bloodsuckers, you say? Hmm...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_901"><text>Well? Any luck? We saw you playing the hero out there...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_902"><text>Are you joking?! There are bloodsuckers there, I barely made it out alive!</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_903"><text>No way! Well, my congratulations! The main thing is you stayed in one piece...</text></string>
<string id="mil_hunter_dialog_904"><text>Joking again? Thanks...</text></string>

<string id="mil_max_dialog_101"><text>Hey there, man! I'm Max. Haven't seen you around here before. You here on business, or just decided to take a breather?</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_102"><text>The name's Marked One. Business, mostly. I'm looking for some information, and I wouldn't turn down some work either.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_103"><text>If it's business, check out that building over there first. You'll find our leader there—goes by the name Lukash. You can also have a chat with Shinkar. After that, swing back here; maybe we can figure out some job to do together.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_104"><text>Alright, I'll be back.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_151"><text>Hi, Marked One! Sorry, I'm waiting for someone right now. We'll chat later.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_152"><text>Whatever you say.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_201"><text>Have you ever dealt with psychos before? Because we've got one here. Think you can get him to talk? If everything goes well, I'll owe you a bottle.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_202"><text>In the Zone, every second person is a psycho. If not every single one. I can talk to him. What do you need to find out?</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_203"><text>Here's the deal: there's a guy holed up in a shack on stilts in the swamp to the right of the road. My guys saw him rushing out of the Red Forest, headlong. He clearly saw something that made him lose his mind. He was mumbling about something... ghosts, some secrets, fragments. I tried to make sense of it, but...\nI have a feeling it's something important, smells like a serious haul, but I can't catch the drift. Try talking to him; if you find anything, you'll get a cut.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_2041"><text>Oh! That weirdo! I've been bringing him food...</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_2042"><text>Hmm... thing is, he kicked the bucket... Yeah.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_2051"><text>Right, our joker Cook says he's feeding a relative. Well, let him; he's still a human being after all.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_2052"><text>Are you sure? What a stroke of bad luck. I guess we're back to square one. Shame. I think there was something interesting in his head. Oh well, this time the ball missed the goal...</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_251"><text>So, how's it going? Everything good? Come on, take a seat, dry your socks, and wet your whistle. Make yourself at home. We're all friends here...</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_301"><text>Greetings, wanderer. Well, did you visit the nutjob? What exactly did that psycho find out there?</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_3021"><text>Well, that nutjob of yours bit the dust, so...</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_3022"><text>I had a talk with that crazy guy...</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_3023"><text>Nah, haven't had the time yet. I'll get around to it sometime.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_3032"><text>Well, did you make any sense of it? Or was it just the same old "I'm scared of ghosts, superior people," and so on?</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_3033"><text>Yeah, go ahead. Time's ticking; someone else might grab whatever he knew for themselves.</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_304"><text>Well... how should I put it. Not much, really. Except, from what I gathered, he's not mumbling about ghosts, but about Ghost. Ever heard of a stalker with that handle?</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_305"><text>Uh-huh. Yeah, I've heard of him. Seen him too. Shady guy. Always asking questions, always disappearing and appearing out of nowhere. Kind of like you. There was a rumor for a while that he and his buddy—Strelok—found a way to reach the very center, the Sarcophagus. But I have my doubts, honestly. What's he to you?</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_306"><text>It seems he or Strelok could help me remember who I am. That psycho mentioned some kind of tool, said he found it in a red tank in the forest. I didn't quite get it, to be honest. Does that ring a bell?</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_307"><text>In the forest? Well... there's only one forest nearby, the Limansk Reserve, stalkers call it the Red Forest. You probably know that. Maybe it's the Red Forest he meant, not a red tank? And if so, maybe he meant a tank *in* the Red Forest? I don't recall anything like that, though who knows—it's wild out there, maybe there are tanks standing around somewhere. Nah. I wouldn't poke my nose into that forest based on such a weak lead. To hell with that. As for the tools, I heard someone say some drunkard in Limansk was blabbering about them. He was talking nonsense... What do you think yourself?</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_308"><text>I think a psycho is just a psycho, what can you expect. But if I get a chance, I'll check what kind of tank it is. Or ask around in Limansk if I head that way. Maybe things will clear up. Anyway, you owe me a bottle!</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_309"><text>You bet! I'll even throw in some ammo. Never hurts to have extra, right?</text></string>
<string id="mil_max_dialog_401"><text>Hey there, brother! How's life? Relax, have a drink. Or did you want something?</text></string>

<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_0"><text>Dude, you're at the Freedom base! Relax, make yourself at home!</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_1"><text>I'm not exactly tensing up.</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_2"><text>Just stay within the bounds of decency, alright? If you start acting out, you've only yourself to blame. We had one guy here who didn't get it; he annoyed everyone so much we sent him for a stroll through a minefield in his birthday suit. Shinkar was swearing up a storm when that guy's arm landed on his head... You catch my drift?</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_3"><text>I catch it, I catch it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog1_4"><text>Good man! You're free to go.</text></string>

<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_0"><text>Ah, fresh meat...</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_1"><text>I don't follow.</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_2"><text>What's there to follow? Think about it: times are lean lately...</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_3"><text>What do you mean?</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_4"><text>I mean exactly what I said! A hungry soldier is a bad soldier. And look how many of us there are here...</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_5"><text>And?</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_6"><text>Where are we supposed to get enough meat? Then you show up, just like you were ordered!</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_7"><text>Uh...</text></string>
<string id="mil_patrol_dialog2_8"><text>Relax, man, I'm just joking. We don't see new faces often, so I decided to see what kind of character you are. Alright, move along, I'm supposed to be on patrol here...</text></string>

<string id="mil_screw_dialog_101"><text>Hey man, did something break on you?</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_102"><text>Break?</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_103"><text>So you're not here for me? Wow! I'm fed up already. As soon as something breaks, everyone runs here and starts whining.</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_104"><text>And who are you?</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_105"><text>I'm a mechanic. A handyman... Screw, that's what they call me. I repair all kinds of machinery and basically anything they bring in. Right now, I've decided to fix up these vehicles. To drive through the Zone with the breeze... Ah, a dream... Well, how should I address you?</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_106"><text>I'm the Marked One.</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_107"><text>What brings you our way? It's not often we see a new face around here. They don't just let anyone onto the territory, as I'm sure you already know.</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_108"><text>I'm just looking around mostly. Also wanted to ask the local folk about a few things. Or maybe there's some work here for me.</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_109"><text>Ah... then you'd better head straight to Lukash, he's the one in charge. You'll find him in the building next door.</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_110"><text>Thanks. I'll be going then...</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_111"><text>Wait, you wouldn't happen to have some vodka on you, would you? I'd give you, say, a couple of weapon repair kits in exchange. Interested?</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1111"><text>I'm interested, but I don't have any with me.</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1121"><text>I've got a bottle saved for a special occasion. Here, take it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1112"><text>That's a shame. You should always have stuff like that with you. You never know. If you get some, stop by, don't be shy. We'll have a few drops to toast our acquaintance.</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1122"><text>Well, thanks! Much appreciated. I'll knock it back in a bit. And this is for you, as promised.</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1113"><text>No problem.</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1123"><text>Thanks to you too. I'll be going...</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_201"><text>Don't bother me, I'm thinking...</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_301"><text>Did you actually bring some of the white stuff?</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_302"><text>Nah, I just dropped in to say hello...</text></string>
<string id="mil_screw_dialog_303"><text>Too bad, we could've sat down and knocked back a couple of glasses...</text></string>

<string id="mil_trader_dialog_101"><text>Well, hello there, stalker. Wanted something? What's your name, by the way?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_102"><text>Hello. I'm the Marked One. Just checking things out. Are you trading?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_103"><text>Hmm, I've got a little bit of everything. I keep our folks supplied with all sorts of necessities. Not for your pretty eyes, of course.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_104"><text>Do you accept rubles? The ones from the PDA?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_105"><text>Can't do without 'em, so yes. Sidorovich hasn't let me down yet, he's keeping his word. So, I'll sell you some small odds and ends for those thin-air coupons. But if you need something more serious, get your artifacts ready.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_106"><text>I see. Same as everywhere else.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_201"><text>And what interesting things have you brought me?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_301"><text>Ah, it's you. What do we desire?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_302"><text>Nothing, just looking around. Actually, I'm looking for a man—Ghost. Haven't heard of him?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_303"><text>Hmm... how could I not have heard... By the way, do you know where Bloodsucker Village is?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_304"><text>Well... sort of. I'm not a frequent guest here; I might get turned around.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_305"><text>That's good... I mean... well, that's not what I'm talking about... An unpleasant situation has developed... Ghost needs help urgently. His signal was coming from the village, but I've got no one to send to help a good man; I might as well call Duty at this rate.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_306"><text>Get to the point.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_307"><text>A couple of guys went into the village, and the other three are just sitting on the outskirts. If you help them, I'll make it worth your while. Are you in?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3071"><text>Not this time.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3081"><text>Look, it's like this... Ghost might die. We have to bail the guy out.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3072"><text>I'm in.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_3082"><text>Good. Make it quick.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_340"><text>Can I get some gear from you?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_341"><text>For the right price, you can get anything.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_350"><text>You were pulling my leg, friend. There's no Ghost out there, just bloodsuckers. Thank God I managed to deal with them.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_351"><text>Whoa, take it easy, stalker! Quick to jump the gun, aren't you... \nI never said anything to you about Ghost... you must have misheard. I said Prosaic, that's who I meant. Looks like he's the one who met his end there. Anyway, here's something for your heroics.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_401"><text>Well, how did it go?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_402"><text>You were feeding me a line, friend. There's no Ghost there, just bloodsuckers. Thank God I killed the beasts.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_403"><text>Was it tough?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_404"><text>It was alright, manageable.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_405"><text>Curious, isn't it... all sorts of nastiness crawling out of the center of the Zone. Where does it even come from? \nAnd I didn't tell you about Ghost... you misheard me. I was talking about Prosaic, that's who I meant. Seems he's the one who bit the dust. Here, take this for your heroics.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_501"><text>I even sent some guys to help you out!</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5021"><text>I've changed my mind, I don't want to take the risk.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5031"><text>Suit yourself. Just don't expect anything from me then.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5041"><text>Whatever, life is worth more than a reward.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5042"><text>Don't get worked up! I'll give it a shot after all.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5022"><text>Hold your horses. I need to get prepared!</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_5032"><text>Prepare all you want, just don't take too long.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_601"><text>So, what's the status on those bloodsuckers? Time is wasting... This is bad.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_6021"><text>Don't panic, it'll be done.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_6022"><text>Forget those bloodsuckers! My life is worth more...</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_6031"><text>It'll be done, sure... You'll be done like a dinner. I thought you were a man of your word, but you're just... all talk.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_6032"><text>Looking out for number one, are we? Well... maybe you're right, maybe you're right.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_701"><text>Word around here is you wiped out the bloodsuckers in the village. True or not?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_702"><text>I handled it...</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_703"><text>Hmm... Was it a struggle?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_704"><text>Manageable. Did you have a personal interest there?</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_705"><text>Well... Yes, I did. I think the matter will be settled now. Oh! Well, for your heroics, take this...</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_706"><text>Hmm... Not exactly a fortune.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_707"><text>You said it yourself, it wasn't that difficult.</text></string>
<string id="mil_trader_dialog_801"><text>Well, hello, Marked One. What did you bring? Or are you in need of something else?</text></string>

<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_0"><text>Who's in charge of supplies around here, and where can I find them?</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_1"><text>What the hell do you need him for?</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_2"><text>Just looking to stock up on some food.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_3"><text>Cook is responsible for the grub; he's usually in the canteen. It's that long building, right after the bridge. You'll see it immediately. But you're better off going to Shinkar anyway, because Cook is likely wasted again: just sits there, mumbling something incoherent under his breath...</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_4"><text>Mumbling?</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_5"><text>What did you expect? A drunk is a drunk. If he didn't know how to cook, we would've sent him packing long ago.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_6"><text>Understood. Thanks.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common1_7"><text>Don't mention it.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_0"><text>Who runs things around here?</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_1"><text>Why do you want to know?</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_21"><text>I'm looking for some information. I have the means to pay, don't worry. Or I could handle an assignment, if we can strike a deal.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_22"><text>I have important information to report from your patrols.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_3"><text>Lukash is our commander. Head straight into the main building. You'll find Shinkar there too; he's more on the trade side, but he knows a lot of people... and a lot of things.</text></string>
<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_4"><text>Thanks.</text></string>
