<string id="freedom_002"><text>Note:\nScrew fixed the shower at the base. Should drop by after the Barrier. Take a wash… and rinse my pants.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_003"><text>Note:\nFarmstead. Warehouses. Duty movement spotted. Group of 5–6 people.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_004"><text>Note:\nDrop by Sidorovich at the Cordon. Check my account.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_005"><text>Note:\nSomeone saw a woman in the Swamps. Bullshit? Check it.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_006"><text>Outgoing:\nHey. What did you want?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_1"><text>Incoming:\nHey. You heading to Radar anytime soon?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_2"><text>Outgoing:\nI am. What’s up?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_3"><text>Incoming:\nYou need to meet a guy there, he’s in the forest. He’s got something for me.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_4"><text>Outgoing:\nWho is he?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_5"><text>Incoming:\nJust someone I know. Doesn’t matter. Will you take his loot for me?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_6"><text>Outgoing:\nIt does matter. Who is he? A loner? Duty?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_7"><text>Incoming:\nWell… not exactly…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_8"><text>Outgoing:\nMonolith?! Go to hell!</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_9"><text>Incoming:\nWhy do you care? He won’t drop you, don’t sweat it. Just make sure you don’t drop him by accident.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_10"><text>Outgoing:\nNo. I said no. Lukash will rip my head off, are you nuts?!</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_11"><text>Incoming:\nSure he will—if you start blabbing left and right.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_12"><text>Outgoing:\nNo. Don’t ask. Not for any money.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_13"><text>Incoming:\nAlright then. He’ll make a stash, you pick it up. He’ll send you the coordinates—I gave him your contact.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_006_14"><text>Outgoing:\nAre you an idiot?! We could be under surveillance!!! Message him right now and tell him not to contact me!!! And screw you altogether, I don’t want any more business with you—I value my life. That’s it, piss off!</text></string>

<string id="freedom_007"><text>Incoming:\nHey! You know what the eggheads are saying about artifacts?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_007_1"><text>Outgoing:\nWhat do you mean?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_007_2"><text>Incoming:\nLong story short, they say you shouldn’t keep them on you for long—some kind of energy radiation.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_007_3"><text>Outgoing:\nRadiation? That’s old news.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_007_4"><text>Incoming:\nNo, something else. Messes with your head real bad… You heard about those stalkers—Lisp and Nasal? And our Vanya Six-Fingered, remember? And that other guy… the cross-eyed one.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_007_5"><text>Outgoing:\nYou’re lumping everyone together. Who knows what issues they had. Vanya croaked from an overdose, they say. And stalkers are reckless anyway—poke their noses everywhere… So what exactly can’t you keep for long?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_007_6"><text>Incoming:\nHow should I know? I don’t care much—I don’t carry them around. I sell everything or stash it. Thought you’d know, you’re our “black belt” :)</text></string>
<string id="freedom_007_7"><text>Outgoing:\nNo, haven’t heard anything.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_007_8"><text>Incoming:\nThen go ask the nerds at Yantar and tell me later :)</text></string>
<string id="freedom_007_9"><text>Outgoing:\nAre you out of your mind? Who’s gonna let me in there?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_007_10"><text>Incoming:\nThen lean on someone who’s got nothing better to do.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_007_11"><text>Outgoing:\nWe’ll see.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_008"><text>Outgoing:\nHey. Made up your mind?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_008_1"><text>Incoming:\nNot sure… Kinda sketchy. You guys have your own rules.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_008_2"><text>Outgoing:\nWhat rules?.. I thought that too at first. First time I showed up, guard at the entrance goes: “Who the hell are you? Drop your gun or get lost!” Jabs a finger at me… Hands filthy, stinks like hell. And there’s a sniper on the tower—yelling and shooting into the sky, either at crows or because he downed too many pills. I’m thinking, hell of a crew…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_008_3"><text>Incoming:\nSo there *are* guards? Means there’s discipline…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_008_4"><text>Outgoing:\nNah, they’re mostly for show. Mostly they just shake people down for ammo and vodka. And those “guards” can ditch their post anytime to go drinking.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_008_5"><text>Incoming:\nSo who’s in charge then?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_008_6"><text>Outgoing:\nThat’s the best part—basically nobody. Not like Duty, with squads, ranks, chain of command. No “orders or else” crap here. There’s one guy, Lukash. He’s kind of the boss. He comes out and says: “Brothers! Someone’s gotta stand watch. You know what kind of trash wanders around here.” “Guys,” he says, “I can take the watch myself if you want…”</text></string>
<string id="freedom_008_7"><text>Incoming:\nAnd he actually stands guard? You’re full of it…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_008_8"><text>Outgoing:\nHe would—but the guys go: “Come on, old man! We’ll do it.” They wanna drink anyway, and when some kind of boss is nearby, booze just doesn’t go down as well. Overall, he’s a solid guy, everything’s simple with him. Come on, you wanted this. No obligations, no Duty-style nonsense.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_008_9"><text>Incoming:\nI’m heading there anyway. I’ll swing by and you’ll tell me more.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_008_10"><text>Outgoing:\nI’ll be waiting… Bring five bottles. Buy yourself in and the guys will treat you like family :))</text></string>

<string id="freedom_009"><text>Incoming:\nSo what’s that weird guy you’ve got there?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_009_1"><text>Outgoing:\nYou heard already? Some dude showed up—looks like a hippie, but he’s alright. Interesting to talk to.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_009_2"><text>Incoming:\nHippie how?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_009_3"><text>Outgoing:\nThe getup. Suede vest, cowboy hat with a string… all covered in beads, round glasses, long hair—and a pacifist, can you believe it :))</text></string>
<string id="freedom_009_4"><text>Incoming:\nPacifist how?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_009_5"><text>Outgoing:\nDoesn’t carry a gun. We were stunned when he said he doesn’t recognize weapons and doesn’t want to take lives from the Zone… Walks around empty. Just a knife :)</text></string>
<string id="freedom_009_6"><text>Incoming:\nHoly shit, I’m impressed! And nothing ate him on the way?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_009_7"><text>Outgoing:\nHe came with an escort—hired some stalker. Wanted to get closer to the center, says there’s more energy there. He’s on his own wavelength entirely. Shows up and goes: “Hello, people, I’m Chapa, can I live with you?” That same evening he walks outside the fence, spreads his arms, closes his eyes—and stands there for two hours. We thought he was high. Turns out he said he was talking to the Zone :)</text></string>
<string id="freedom_009_8"><text>Incoming:\nAnd how did the talk go? :))</text></string>
<string id="freedom_009_9"><text>Outgoing:\nPretty well. Next day he goes off somewhere and brings back a Flash, trades it to us for food. If he keeps doing that every day, we’ll be eating chocolate marzipan soon :)</text></string>
<string id="freedom_009_10"><text>Incoming:\nWell damn! Not a simple guy… I should talk to him too. Maybe he’ll put in a good word with the Zone for me :)</text></string>

<string id="freedom_010"><text>Incoming:\nWhy did you jump that stalker yesterday? Something you didn’t split?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_010_1"><text>Outgoing:\nMe? Jump him? Seriously?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_010_2"><text>Incoming:\nYou don’t remember yelling: “I wouldn’t piss on your Marked One!” and decking the guy? What did he have to do with it? You should’ve punched the Marked One instead… I got caught in the crossfire too…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_010_3"><text>Outgoing:\nYeah… alright, my screw-up, I admit it. What do you want from me? Why you sulking?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_010_4"><text>Incoming:\nWhat do I want? You punch me, kick me in the eye, then go “sorry, didn’t mean it”? That’s low…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_010_5"><text>Outgoing:\nReally? Damn… I don’t remember a thing, swear. Bird sickness—drank too much… And I’ve got a black eye myself, so it didn’t come from nowhere…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_010_6"><text>Incoming:\nYeah… hell of a night…</text></string>

<string id="freedom_011"><text>Incoming:\nHey, what’s new over there?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_011_1"><text>Outgoing:\nSame old. What about you?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_011_2"><text>Incoming:\nSancho sent word. He’s in the district hospital now, chilling in surgery. Got in easy—slipped a couple of tens to the girls at intake, now they’re dusting him off like royalty.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_011_3"><text>Incoming:\nTold the doc he got perforated while hunting :) The guy’s cool, by the way… even hinting he wouldn’t mind doing some “hunting” himself.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_011_4"><text>Outgoing:\nNow that’s a theme. We should drag that doc over here, nurses included :))</text></string>
<string id="freedom_011_5"><text>Incoming:\nSancho said he’ll work on him—don’t worry, he’ll show up :)</text></string>
<string id="freedom_011_6"><text>Outgoing:\nGood. That Swamp guy’s gotten way too cocky—only patches up stalkers, won’t even show his face around us…</text></string>

<string id="freedom_012"><text>Incoming:\nYo! Heard what our stoner idiots pulled?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_012_1"><text>Outgoing:\nNo. What are you talking about?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_012_2"><text>Incoming:\nWhat?! Haven’t heard yet?! Alright, sit back and read :))\nSo Max’s crew started walking around with these mysterious mugs like “ohhh, we know something but won’t tell you”… whispering, scheming, then vanished as a group. Even Max didn’t know where they went. Then—bam!—they show up a day later. Naked. Butt naked. Stark naked, just like momma made them!</text></string>
<string id="freedom_012_3"><text>Outgoing:\nNo way! You’re bullshitting…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_012_4"><text>Incoming:\nWhole base saw it. Laughter everywhere, people nearly turning blue. Lukash thought bandits stripped them, but they just mumble and stay quiet. Me and the guys start grilling them: spill it—maybe you overdid it hard and the trip had you running back naked?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_012_5"><text>Outgoing:\nSo? You find out? Don’t drag it out…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_012_6"><text>Incoming:\nMax finally cracked them. They found some moss nearby. Purple-looking, shiny. Those experiment junkies try everything—so they smoked the moss…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_012_7"><text>Outgoing:\nAnd what, it really hits that hard?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_012_8"><text>Incoming:\nYou have no idea—total launch! But they didn’t come back naked because of the high. That moss straight-up ate everything they had, can you imagine? They picked it in a little grove, smoked it right there, passed out—dead to the world. And the moss ate their suits, rifles, everything—everything except them.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_012_9"><text>Outgoing:\nLike a Greedy anomaly?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_012_10"><text>Incoming:\nNah… different somehow. Max says when they came to, they thought it was a hallucination. Turned out it wasn’t—so they really had to shake their balls all the way back to base. Good thing nobody ate them on the way…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_012_11"><text>Outgoing:\nAh! So that’s where the naked guy came from! Remember, the one who showed up here? Guess he smoked himself stupid—still sitting there mooing like a cow…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_012_12"><text>Incoming:\nThat clearing’s gonna be a pilgrimage site now, I’m telling you. Chui Valley :)) Lukash is already scratching his head on how to keep people out…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_012_13"><text>Outgoing:\nLike that’ll stop anyone :) Everyone’s ass will be itching till they try it :)</text></string>

<string id="freedom_013"><text>Incoming:\nRead this message and pass it on!\nGuys, free stalkers! There’s a legit topic. Take a “Medusa,” carefully scrape it with a knife. You need about half a matchbox. Then keep that matchbox near a “Slime” for a week. What you get—mix it with tobacco. That’s it—smoke up and enjoy! :) Solid trip guaranteed! Direct flight to space and to Jah!\nSend thanks in vodka :)</text></string>

<string id="freedom_014"><text>Outgoing:\nThey say the guys caught some Duty boys in Dark Valley. True?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_014_1"><text>Incoming:\nSeems like it… Those were sniffing around, so the boys grabbed them.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_014_2"><text>Outgoing:\nAnd what now? Ransom?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_014_3"><text>Incoming:\nWho needs those morons? Their boss doesn’t give a damn—one more, one less… They’ll recruit fresh meat, idiots are never in short supply.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_014_4"><text>Incoming:\nA buddy whispered they’re keeping them in a cage. You know how psycho they are—always rush to shoot first.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_014_5"><text>Outgoing:\nYeah, “kiiiill!”—they love that :)) Then slap on a gas mask and start hopping :)</text></string>
<string id="freedom_014_6"><text>Incoming:\nExactly! :)</text></string>

<string id="freedom_015"><text>Incoming:\nHeard they tore Sanya the Cheerful’s leg off?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_015_1"><text>Outgoing:\nWhere? Is he alive?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_015_2"><text>Incoming:\nAlive, but real bad. At the Barrier zombies rushed in, he caught shrapnel—leg got shattered clean. The guys shot him up, bandaged him, piled artifacts around him. He’s holding on, but between us—might’ve been better if it ended right there. What’s he gonna do without a leg?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_015_3"><text>Outgoing:\nPoor bastard. I’ll talk to a guy I know—he might know someone who worked as a doctor… or a paramedic, not sure. I’ll go see him, talk about Sanya. Slim chance, but maybe…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_015_4"><text>Incoming:\nGo for it. Artifacts are artifacts, but real medical help’s more reliable. Maybe something works out.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_016"><text>Outgoing:\nHey, man! I know what you’re taking. Think it’s all doped-up junkies here and nobody noticed you? We’ve seen all kinds. You sniffing around to spy and report, huh? That’s your Duty, yeah? Well I’ll say it myself—pass it to your boss: if not for us, you’d all be dead already! Who do you think holds the Barrier?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_016_1"><text>Incoming:\nMorons, all of you!</text></string>
<string id="freedom_016_2"><text>Outgoing:\nYeah, but they’re our morons. Your snot-nosed kids shoot a couple bandits with pistols, pop two dogs as a squad of ten, and start yelling: “We’re the Zone’s defenders!”</text></string>
<string id="freedom_016_3"><text>Incoming:\nGo to hell, you whiny junkie!</text></string>
<string id="freedom_016_4"><text>Outgoing:\nWatch your mouth, holy crap, and stop hanging around the base. Go take a walk to the Barrier and see what kind of critters are lying there—you’ve never even seen stuff like that. Move it, man, and don’t flash that triple-zoom binocular of yours—I can see you real clear through a scope. Oh, and that suit Voronin gave you is crap. Even our rookies don’t wear padded jackets like that. Later, loser! And change your diaper—you stink all the way over here.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_017"><text>Incoming:\nWhere can I look for “Grandma’s Beads”? Any tips. Please.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_017_1"><text>Outgoing:\nLost your mind? You don’t look for those—you cook them.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_017_2"><text>Incoming:\nWell then, share the recipe.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_017_3"><text>Outgoing:\nDon’t tell me what to do and I won’t tell you where to go… Want to ask about the price instead?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_017_4"><text>Incoming:\nWell damn! Some friend you are… Pfft! *spit*</text></string>

<string id="freedom_018"><text>Outgoing:\nFor fuck’s sake! That damn elusive Sherstyuk is driving me nuts!</text></string>
<string id="freedom_018_1"><text>Incoming:\nI told you—only way to catch him is daytime, outside the complex, if the critters aren’t acting up. At night he sits and shoots back with everyone else in the institute building.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_018_2"><text>Outgoing:\nI did find the warrant officer. Learned nothing—he’s clueless. At least I traded vodka for grenades, so not a total loss.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_018_3"><text>Incoming:\nWell, if grandma had balls, she’d be grandpa.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_018_4"><text>Outgoing:\nWhat was that supposed to mean so poetically?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_018_5"><text>Incoming:\nYou’re thick… If Sherstyuk knew everything, he wouldn’t be a warrant officer—he’d be a general!</text></string>
<string id="freedom_018_6"><text>Outgoing:\nGot it… Still, a military property thief beats any general…</text></string>

<string id="freedom_019"><text>Note:\nThree hundred Soviet wrappers for matches is a perfectly realistic price in places like this. Flared jeans with rhinestones will be cheaper in the Zone, but matches are essential—hence the price.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_020"><text>Incoming:\nAnd there’s no crate there…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_020_1"><text>Outgoing:\nThere is! Bet a crate of beer?\nTourists…</text></string>

<string id="freedom_021"><text>Outgoing:\nNear the Barrier, heading back to base, I found a glowing Gauss rifle—but can’t take it. Damn shame. Every time I try, a small harmless “Greedy” anomaly pops up. Greed’s killing me—I can’t walk away, but I can’t grab it either.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_021_1"><text>Incoming:\nI see you through the tower optics. Dancing in place like an idiot. Get your ass back to base, fast!</text></string>
<string id="freedom_021_2"><text>Outgoing:\nWhat about the Gauss?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_021_3"><text>Incoming:\nTo hell with it! You’ll summon Monolith next…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_021_4"><text>Outgoing:\nIf you were here, I’d throw it on *your* hell… Alright, coming.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_022"><text>Outgoing:\nIs there a way to search for mines?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_022_1"><text>Incoming:\nWhy the hell are you heading into a minefield?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_022_2"><text>Outgoing:\nToo late for a girl to ask her mom’s permission when she’s no longer a girl. I’m already in the minefield.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_022_3"><text>Incoming:\nYou stoned or what?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_022_4"><text>Outgoing:\nWish I was… Decided to shorten the path to the Barrier. Looks like I shortened my life instead.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_022_5"><text>Incoming:\nAlright, don’t say goodbye just yet. A bolt is a stalker’s best friend—even in a minefield. You won’t set a mine off with it, but if it hits one, you’ll hear a distinctive click.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_022_6"><text>Outgoing:\nOkey-dokey! Got it. Commencing the throwing.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_023"><text>Outgoing:\nBy the way, guys—inside which “Snowflake” (they all look the same, right?) can you cook a “Spring”? Nothing works. Tried tossing it with an arc, underhand, even sitting backwards in the center—no luck… What’s the secret?</text></string>

<string id="freedom_024"><text>Outgoing:\nHeard from hunters that you can sneak up on a pack of monsters at the right moment, when they’re all piled up—sleeping or whatever, hell knows. Then cover them all with a grenade in one go! Saves ammo like crazy.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_024_1"><text>Incoming:\nClever idea…\nJust keep in mind—after the “boom,” half the Zone will come running to see what the hell you pulled off…</text></string>

<string id="freedom_025"><text>Incoming:\nAll women are baAaAstards!!!</text></string>
<string id="freedom_025_1"><text>Outgoing:\nYou’re sick. There are no women in the Zone.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_025_2"><text>Incoming:\nBaAaAstards?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_025_3"><text>Outgoing:\nWomen.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_025_4"><text>Incoming:\nOh yeah! They say one’s hopping around the Swamps.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_025_5"><text>Outgoing:\nHow’s that?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_025_6"><text>Incoming:\nLike a baAaAstard!</text></string>

<string id="freedom_026"><text>Outgoing:\nGuys, in the Red Forest, near the gate, there’s a bloodsucker sitting in a cage. Don’t shoot. He’s kind of tamed. Better toss him something—vodka, sausage. He’ll even puff a cigarette…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_026_1"><text>Incoming:\nWell I’ll be damned! A Durov’s Corner, huh. Drinks, eats, and smokes…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_026_2"><text>Incoming:\nIf I see it, I’ll shoot it! No point tormenting an animal like that.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_027"><text>Incoming:\nYou seen the gadget that army-stalker lieutenant has?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_027_1"><text>Outgoing:\nNope. Didn’t see him relieve himself.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_027_2"><text>Incoming:\nBlockhead! I meant his gun!</text></string>
<string id="freedom_027_3"><text>Outgoing:\nAh… a sniper rifle? If it’s like Sherstyuk’s, then yeah, I’ve “seen” one. Can’t hit shit with it. Just for showing off.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_027_4"><text>Incoming:\nThe lieutenant had some kind of American piece. Pretty thing…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_027_5"><text>Outgoing:\nWhat’s there to stare at? Not a naked woman in a bathhouse…</text></string>

<string id="freedom_028"><text>Note:\nTurns out I was right about that red spot on the small head. That’s the weak point of chimeras! Yesterday near Bloodsucker Village I spotted one. Lying in the sun, turned its small head straight toward me—and the spot was like a red bullseye. So I smacked it with the SVD. One shot—one claw.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_029"><text>Outgoing:\nFound a chimera nest. Two adults and three—what do you call them—yearlings. Now I’m thinking: how do I deal with them all at once?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_029_1"><text>Incoming:\nA Vintorez and a couple of grenades will even the odds…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_029_2"><text>Incoming:\nOr pick a time when they’re asleep. Sneak in and put one in each ear. Suppressor only—don’t wake the rest.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_029_3"><text>Incoming:\nOr better yet, just shoot yourself right away and save the trouble. :)</text></string>

<string id="freedom_030"><text>Note:\nWalking along a little bridge in the Swamps, from the west toward the motor yard. Mindin’ my own business. Suddenly a boar charges from one side of the bridge, and another pig comes full speed from the other. I jump into the water (radiation fades, but those would kill me instantly)—the boars smash heads and drop dead. One of them even flew ten meters back the way it came from. First time I’ve ever seen that. Now if only I could teach cats to swim—damn things are driving me nuts.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_031"><text>Note:\nSome weird zombies started pushing in from the Yantar side. They scatter from grenades, take cover, and pop out crouching. If they’ve got guns, they fire very accurately—not spraying bursts, but controlled shots. Maybe I’m missing something, but aren’t they supposed to be dumb? Where’s all this smart behavior coming from? Or are these fresh ones whose brains haven’t fully rotted yet?</text></string>

<string id="freedom_032"><text>Note:\nAK-103 is the real deal! Picked one up from Sultan about a week ago—now I go on runs without fear.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_033"><text>Incoming:\nYou should also use SP-5 ammo—it wears the barrel less than PAB-9.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_033_1"><text>Outgoing:\nTrue enough. The PAB-9 description even says it’s “a cheap analogue of SP-5, heavily fouls the barrel and isn’t meant for the VSS or Val.” Tested in practice—both armor-piercing and sniper rounds cause 2–2.5 times less wear. So the balance of the VSS and Val makes sense, considering their stopping power. But as for the Groza—something’s clearly off. It’s an assault weapon; it shouldn’t fail its owner that fast.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_033_2"><text>Incoming:\nThis is the ZONE! A lot of things aren’t right here.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_034"><text>Incoming:\nThey say you can get some miracle sausage in the Gut—doesn’t spoil, very filling. The craftsmen trade it for monster parts, but nobody says which ones exactly. They say you gotta find the Butcher. What’s that sausage even made of? I’ll find out on the spot.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_034_1"><text>Outgoing:\nBetter not find out. Otherwise you won’t be able to put that sausage in your mouth…</text></string>

<string id="freedom_035"><text>Outgoing:\nBrothers, anyone nearby—help!</text></string>
<string id="freedom_035_1"><text>Incoming:\nWhy the yelling?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_035_2"><text>Outgoing:\nJust finished fending off dogs, almost out of ammo, and then a whole swarm of tushkano rats popped out of nowhere! Barely made it up a tree.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_035_3"><text>Incoming:\nSo that’s why you’re sitting in a tree. I’m looking through the scope thinking…</text></string>

<string id="freedom_035_4"><text>Outgoing:\nLess thinking, more helping.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_035_5"><text>Incoming:\nListen up. There’s a shack near your tree—two walls and half a roof. But I see a “Jelly” bubbling on the floor. Crawl along the branch on the left up to the attic; the tushkanos will chase you below and stumble straight into the anomaly. If not all of them die, the rest definitely won’t care about you anymore.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_035_6"><text>Outgoing:\nCan’t you just come over and shoot them?</text></string>
<string id="freedom_035_7"><text>Incoming:\nNah, brother. Don’t feel like wasting SVD rounds on tiny crap like that. Get moving—if you keep talking, chimeras might show up too.</text></string>

<string id="freedom_036"><text>Incoming:\nThis is Colonel Petrenko. Message to all stalkers: come to the Bar. Duty provides stalkers with high-quality equipment for survival in the Zone, in exchange for artifacts later transferred to scientists for research.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_036_1"><text>Outgoing:\nYeah right—now you can’t even get to Sakharov without a shovel, artifacts piled everywhere, impossible to clear…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_036_2"><text>Incoming:\nAnd for dirty insinuations and discrediting Duty’s difficult but noble mission of saving humanity, a lemon grenade might fly into someone’s druggie campfire. Suddenly. Or something worse…</text></string>
<string id="freedom_036_3"><text>Incoming:\nAlright, stop teasing the moose. Don’t you have enough problems? The slow learners will be sent to the Barrier for a couple of weeks—no rotation. Go lecture flesh and chimeras about justice.</text></string>
<string id="freedom_036_4"><text>Outgoing:\nAlright, alright…</text></string>
